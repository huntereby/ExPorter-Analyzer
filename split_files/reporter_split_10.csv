Generalized approaches for laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), a prevalent and heterogeneous syndrome in
which laryngeal symptoms are attributed to gastroesophageal reflux, have led to poor health outcomes,
inappropriate resource utilization, and tremendous healthcare costs. As a physician scientist with advanced
training in esophageal physiology and health outcomes research, my long-term career goal is to discover
phenotype guided care paradigms for esophageal conditions, such as LPR, focused on distinct disease
mechanism. My preliminary findings from single-arm clinical trials, observational studies, and initial
translational research in LPR have generated the central hypothesis that novel diagnostic biomarkers can
identify clinical-physiologic phenotypes of LPR and guide a mechanism focused treatment strategy. Thus, the
research goals of this proposal are to (1) measure the efficacy of the novel therapeutic upper esophageal
sphincter assist device in a rigorous biomarker targeted randomized sham-controlled trial of 78 subjects with
salivary pepsin positive LPR, (2) identify phenotypes of LPR using latent class analysis of comprehensive
physiologic and clinical data, and (3) compare oral microbiome between subjects with and without pepsin
positive LPR. The research aims are aligned with my training goals to (1) develop expertise in advanced
clinical trial methods, (2) acquire skills in phenotype design and latent class analysis, and (3) obtain experience
with translational microbiome research. My outstanding and diverse mentorship team is overseen by primary
mentor Dr. Samir Gupta, an expert clinical trialist that has contributed seminal discoveries in colorectal cancer
screening. Co-mentors include Dr. John Pandolfino, a leading international authority and clinical researcher in
esophageal physiology, and Dr. Bernd Schnabl, a physician scientist that has pioneered work in host effects on
the intestinal microbiome. The exceptionally supportive and conducive institutional environment at University
of California San Diego (UCSD) is a key strength of this application. UCSD’s NIH supported Clinical
Translational Research Institute will provide cutting-edge clinical trial infrastructure. UCSD’s Center for
Esophageal Diseases and Center for Voice & Swallowing Disorders will ensure successful subject recruitment
and access to state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques. UCSD’s P30 supported Digestive Diseases Research
Center directed by Dr. Bernd Schnabl, will provide leading resources in microbiomics and bioinformatics.
Immediate anticipated impacts of this proposal are to inform the clinical management of LPR and shed light
on a novel mechanistic pathway of inflammation in LPR, as well as enhance my career by providing unique
skills in clinical trial methods and microbiome research. Ultimately, this career development proposal will
launch my career as an impactful leader in multi-disciplinary clinical-translational research in the field of aero-
digestive esophageal diseases."

 The long-term objectives are to develop and validate rat models of disease that allow investigators to
measure the differential effects of XX and XY sex chromosomes that protect from or exacerbate disease. Most
human diseases occur differently in males and females, indicating that one sex is protected or vulnerable
because of factors that are inherently different in the two sexes. Understanding the mechanisms of protection
or vulnerability involves isolating different molecular pathways causing greater or less protection. Sex
chromosomes (XX vs. XY) are one major source of sex bias within any type of cell, but this category has been
difficult to discriminate from gonadal hormone effects that often co-vary with sex chromosome complement. To
isolate and study sex chromosome effects, it is necessary to make experimental models comparing XX and XY
animals with the same type of gonad. Such models have not been available to investigators who study rats, but
have just become available. The modified rats have two genetic mutations, to introduce the testis-determining
gene Sry onto a non-sex-chromosome, and to knock Sry out on the Y chromosome. These modifications
produce XY and XX rats with ovaries, and XX and XY rats with testes. The proposal is to study the newly
developed genetically modified rat lines, to establish the nature of genetic sequence in and near the two
genetic modifications, and to determine how the modifications change the development of ovaries and testes.
Rats bearing these modifications will be compared to normal rats, to measure: physiology of reproduction,
sexual development of the brain, cardiac function, systemic and pulmonary hypertension, and hypertension-
related cognitive function. Rats offer significant advantages as models of human physiology and disease,
because of their large size, the large literature concerning basic physiology and sex differences in rats, their
superior cognitive ability, and suitability of rats to research on specific diseases. The successful rat models will
be deposited in the Rat Resources & Research Center and made widely available to other investigators."

Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) is a rare disorder of aging Americans, causing asymmetric muscle
weakness and severe disability and morbidity. It is currently untreatable, and poorly understood. The
prevalence of sIBM is likely to increase as the proportion of the United States population above the age of 65
years continues to grow. A major barrier to clinical trials in sIBM has been the lack of full understanding of the
natural history of the disease. It remains to be determined whether the rates of disease progression is uniform
and whether the various biomarkers associated with sIBM (anti-NT5c1A antibodies, variant T-cell populations)
influence the natural history and disease behavior. Given the slow rate of disease progression, such
observations cannot be made in the context of a routine clinical trial, and such studies need to be done as a
separate stand-alone observational study. To address these unmet needs, we propose a prospective study
with four specific aims. Aim 1: To determine for the first time whether c1A antibodies mediate disease
progression over a two year interval in patients with sIBM. Aim 2: To perform a detailed morphological,
histochemical, and immunohistochemical analysis of fresh muscle biopsy specimens obtained from a subset of
patients with sIBM. Aim 3: To characterize the distribution of “immunosenescent” lymphocytes in circulating
blood from patients with sIBM. Aim 4: To quantify the decline in the respiratory function of sIBM patients. The
significance of our proposed study is 1) to allow for a detailed characterization of the disease progression in
sIBM over a two-year period, and 2) to explore the relationship of a number of biomarkers associated with
sIBM, and their influence on disease behavior and disease progression. Upon completion of these aims, we
will 1) understand the disease phenotype, including pattern of respiratory involvement, and disease
progression in sIBM better and understand the influence of serum antibodies to NT5c1A antibodies on the
natural history and disease behavior; 2) define differences in serum variant T-cells and cytokine signatures in
sIBM patients and their influence on disease progression and behavior; and 3) understand muscle pathology
and immune cell distribution in sIBM patients and its relationship to NT5c1A antibodies. These findings may
influence future trial design in sIBM. Finally, we will have created a thirteen-site consortium of myositis
treatment centers that will be ready to adopt quickly any future clinical trials aimed at changing the course of
sIBM."

 Dr. Ong is a neurologist and young investigator pursuing patient-oriented clinical research. For this K-23
submission, she will develop a novel framework for dynamic risk prediction of life-threatening mass effect after
ischemic stroke using both baseline and longitudinal variables through the first 120 hours after admission. A
K23 award will provide her with the means to acquire critical career development skills that will enable her to
execute and build upon her project including: 1) dynamic risk prediction and trajectory analysis; 2) multi-modal
methods of neuroprognostication; 3) clinical trial design; and 4) professional development. These objectives
will help Dr. Ong to achieve her long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator of data-
driven tools that support clinical decision making and optimize outcomes after acute brain injury. Dr. Ong has
recruited a multi-disciplinary mentorship team to assist her in executing her project and achieving scientific
independence. She will be co-mentored by Dr. David Greer, an R01 funded clinician scientist with expertise in
neurocritical care, neuroprognostication, and clinical study design, and Dr. Emelia Benjamin, an R01 funded
leading cerebrovascular epidemiologist and risk prediction specialist with extensive mentorship experience. Dr.
Josée Dupuis, Chair of Biostatistics at Boston University School of Public Health, will serve as a methodologic
mentor overseeing Dr. Ong’s progress in dynamic modeling strategies. Dr. Ong’s overarching hypothesis is
that dynamic risk models that update their predictions with newly available longitudinal data will improve
prediction of Life-Threatening Mass Effect and better support clinical decision making in real-time. Aim 1 will
use a retrospective medical record dataset of 3000 large stroke patients to identify variables trajectories
predictive of radiographic LTME, and use this information to develop updating multivariable dynamic risk
models of LTME comprised of baseline and longitudinal variables for the first 120 hours of admission. In Aim 2,
she will study the relationship of hourly quantitative pupillometry and LTME through the prospective recruitment
of 60 patients with large stroke, and develop an exploratory dynamic multivariable model of LTME using
Dr. Ong’s proposed research is
significant because improving LTME prediction can facilitate more timely life- and function-sparing interventions.
Her research is innovative because she will develop and apply a novel dynamic risk modeling framework to predict
secondary injury following ischemic stroke, and study the new promising longitudinal variable, quantitative
pupillometry.
predictive variables identified in Aim 1 as well as hourly pupillometry data.
Her aims, training plan, and interdisciplinary mentorship team will prepare Dr. Ong to become an
independent investigator of data-driven tools that support clinical decision making and optimize outcomes after
acute brain injury. The anticipated results will be strong preliminary data for a R01 proposal testing the effect of
dynamic LTME assessments on time to intervention and outcome in clinical practice."

HIV infection is accompanied by a number of co-morbidities, with cardio-metabolic complications being among
the most prominent. Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) controls the HIV load and reverses immunodeficiency,
but does not eliminate HIV-associated co-morbidities. The mechanisms responsible for the persistence of cardio-
metabolic co-morbidities in ART-treated HIV-infected subjects with an undetectable virus load remain unknown,
preventing the development of therapeutic treatments. Our studies identified HIV protein Nef as the main
contributor to viral effects on cholesterol metabolism and potential cardiac phenotypes. Other recent reports from
several groups demonstrated that HIV-infected cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing Nef, which
were found in the plasma of ~50% of ART-treated HIV-infected individuals with undetectable viral load. We
showed that Nef-containing EVs, but not EVs produced by cells infected with Nef-deficient HIV, triggered
perturbations of cellular cholesterol metabolism in uninfected macrophages, increased abundance and changed
the properties of lipid rafts in these cells, and led to potentiation of inflammatory responses. These findings led
us to a hypothesis that changes to lipid rafts induced by Nef EVs may underlie the mechanism of cardio-
metabolic co-morbidities of HIV disease, and therefore these co-morbidities can be treated by agents blocking
or reversing the Nef-induced changes of lipid rafts. We named this treatment approach “lipid raft therapy”. In the
proposed project we will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will
characterize the effects of Nef-containing EVs on the composition and structure of the lipid rafts and will relate
these changes to functional properties. We will also determine whether treatments blocking the effect of Nef EVs
on lipid rafts can reverse the Nef-induced functional effects. In Aim 2, we will investigate the association between
Nef EVs and cardio-metabolic co-morbidities and will test lipid raft-targeting treatment approaches in vivo. We
will use apoE-/- mice transgenic for HIV or infected with murine HIV (EcoHIV) to model HIV-associated
atherosclerosis and metabolic impairment. In Aim 3, we will determine whether levels of exNef in plasma of
people living with HIV (PLWH) correlate with markers of cardio-metabolic co-morbidities, whether blood
monocytes of PLWH exhibit lipid rafts changes, and whether these changes can be reversed ex vivo by the lipid
raft therapy tested in Aims 1 and 2. Together, these studies will describe a new mechanism of HIV-associated
co-morbidities and will investigate new therapeutic treatments targeting this mechanism, thus producing both a
basic science and a translational impact on the field."
10834746,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Worsening population-level trends in cardiometabolic health highlight the profound need to move away
from traditional disease models focused on the remediation of downstream cardiometabolic risk factors to instead
focus on relevant upstream exposures. Relevant upstream exposures include early life adversities (ELA), a
unique subset of social determinants of health that occur early in life and are hypothesized to become biologically
embedded, thereby shaping life course trajectories of health and disease risk over time. A robust literature shows
ELA exposures confer prospective risk for cardiometabolic disease, yet few—albeit promising—studies have
examined whether early intervention in ELA-exposed children may lessen this risk. Review of relevant literatures
suggests generally that 1) earlier intervention is more effective; 2) intervention benefits are greatest in families
most in need; 3) parenting is a mechanism through which early intervention benefits are transmitted; and 4)
existing parenting interventions, deemed successful with respect to parent-child behavioral and relationship
outcomes, are candidates for testing in relation to child physical health outcomes. Building on this foundation,
the proposed study represents a unique and time-sensitive opportunity to extend the aims of an existing RCT in
which a parenting intervention—Promoting First Relationships® (PFR) versus no intervention—was implemented
as an adjuvant to depression treatment in a sample of low income, postnatal women. The purpose of the
proposed study is to determine whether benefits of the PFR intervention, originally designed to impact parent-
child behavioral and relationship outcomes in infancy may extend to the child’s cardiometabolic health in early
childhood. It is hypothesized that the PFR intervention will augment an upstream resiliency factor—parenting
quality—at an early period of vulnerability, potentially benefiting the child’s cardiometabolic health. Expected
intervention effects on the more distal child cardiometabolic health outcomes are hypothesized to be partially
attributable to changes in the more proximal intervention-related targets, including maternal sensitivity, parent
understanding, mother-child relationship quality, and child self-regulation. The proposed study seeks NIH funding
to support the return of 214 mother-child dyads (85% of 252 total families) who participated in the original RCT.
The majority of families (80%) belong to a minority race/ethnic group, 32% are Spanish-speaking, and all are
considered low income. Families will complete two home-based visits between child’s age 5-6 and 7-8 years.
These visits will entail assessments that parallel measures in the original study regarding parent-child behavioral
and relationship outcomes but will also include health-focused assessments in domains known to predict long-
term risk for disease, including cardiovascular health, metabolic health, and inflammation. Health indicators will
be derived from data sources including anthropometric and blood pressure assessments, a dried blood spot
collection, activity and sleep monitoring, and interviewer-administered questionnaires. Results will extend
broadly to vulnerable families at disproportionate risk for poor cardiometabolic health."

Persistent and worsening racial and ethnic disparities in severe maternal morbidity and mortality in the US are
urgent public health concerns requiring innovative, sustainable solutions. The perinatal period, the time before
and after birth, has important implications for a woman’s health and that of her child. Unfortunately, standard
perinatal care fails to meet the needs of women from Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC)
communities, especially with consideration to the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) and the systemic racism
that drive health disparities. Doula care is increasingly recommended to support high-risk BIPOC women during
labor and the immediate postpartum period and is posited to mitigate the effects of racism and SDoH in
underserved populations. However, a key limitation to doula care is that doulas are largely relegated to working
in parallel with the healthcare team and the potential consequences of this include disjointed care coordination
and missed opportunities to improve healthcare quality for BIPOC women. Building on our team’s prior and
current work optimizing perinatal care for medically underserved women, we will develop and evaluate a Well-
Mama intervention in 3 participating medical centers in Chicago IL, Baton Rouge LA, and Newark NJ which have
some of the highest US rates of maternal morbidity and mortality. The Well-Mama intervention is centered on
uninsured and publicly insured pregnant and postpartum BIPOC women supported by Community Doula
Navigators (CDNs) who will conduct in-person and telehealth wellness check-ins using the Well-Mama safety
checklist; make referrals to resources following the check-ins, with feedback provided to the perinatal care team;
lead virtual pregnancy and postpartum support groups; attend select patient visits; and provide labor support.
The Well-Mama checklist includes 5 priority topic areas representing leading factors in maternal morbidity and
mortality in which to attune doulas and their patients: (a) mental health/depression; (b) cardiovascular symptoms;
(c) safety (e.g., guns at home and intimate partner violence); (d) opioid/substance abuse; and (e) social support,
self-agency, and well-being. Well-Mama advances a Shared Care Model approach to health care delivery
focused on interprofessional collaboration in relation to centering care on the individual patient. Through a Hybrid
Type 1 randomized effectiveness-implementation trial of N=576 women, we will compare the effectiveness of
the Well-Mama intervention relative to standard perinatal care in improving women’s receipt of recommended
care components (primary outcome), reducing patient medical distrust and experience of racism/discrimination,
increasing health engagement, self-efficacy, and perception of care team quality, and enhancing perinatal care
team cohesion (secondary outcomes), while evaluating intervention implementation. Results will optimize doula
integrated perinatal care to address the top drivers of maternal morbidity and mortality with the goal of reducing
maternal health disparities experienced by pregnant and postpartum BIPOC women."

 Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has emerged as the most common form of heart failure
among Veterans, yet there is currently a paucity of treatment strategies that have been proven to improve
prognosis. A primary reason for the lack of effective therapies for this increasingly prevalent condition is the
limited understanding of mechanisms underlying myocardial stiffening, a key pathophysiologic component of
HFpEF that is directly linked to exertional dyspnea, the cardinal presenting symptom of the disorder. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to address this problem by elucidating the role of repetitive stretch-induced
remodeling of the cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) as a mechanistic link between chronic coronary artery
disease (CAD) and HFpEF, two conditions that are extremely common in the Veteran population. Based on our
preliminary data from multiple clinically-relevant swine models of heart disease, we hypothesize that
myocardial stiffening develops in the setting of chronic CAD as a result of repetitive stretch-induced
fibrosis caused by intermittent elevations in left ventricular (LV) preload. If so, this may explain why such
a large proportion of the HFpEF population exhibits angiographically-significant epicardial CAD (~60-70% in
multiple cohorts) and might have important clinical implications related to the use of coronary revascularization
in these patients, since the reversibility of repetitive stretch-induced myocardial fibrosis is unclear.
 To test this hypothesis, we will utilize a porcine model of chronic epicardial CAD to better understand how
exposure to episodic preload elevation influences remodeling of ischemic and non-ischemic regions of the left
ventricle in this setting. In Aim 1, implantable telemetry will be used for continuous hemodynamic monitoring to
quantify the frequency of preload elevation in swine with either multi-vessel (MV-CAD) or single-vessel CAD
(SV-CAD) and determine whether repetitive preload elevation is required for the development of interstitial
fibrosis in remote, non-ischemic myocardium. In Aim 2, percutaneous angioplasty will be performed in swine
with MV-CAD and swine with SV-CAD to determine if repetitive stretch-induced stiffening associated with MV-
CAD dictates whether LV fibrosis is reversed by revascularization. Post-mortem analysis of isolated cardiac
fibroblasts and decellularized cardiac ECM from these models will be completed in Aim 3 to assess the mechanistic
role of ECM-dependent fibroblast activation in repetitive stretch-induced LV stiffening and determine whether
increased ECM stiffness per se causes protracted fibroblast activation that promotes persistent fibrosis through a
self-sustaining positive feedback loop.
 These aims will be addressed by a multi-disciplinary investigative team using an integrative research
approach that combines serial investigation of regional and global myocardial mechanics with ex vivo mechanical
and biological analysis of myocardial tissue strips, isolated cardiac fibroblasts, and decellularized cardiac ECM.
Collectively, these experiments in translationally-relevant swine models of heart disease are expected to
establish repetitive stretch-induced ECM remodeling as a mechanistic link between CAD and HFpEF and
facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies to reduce the unacceptably high morbidity and mortality
of Veterans with these increasingly prevalent conditions."

The overall goals of this 3 year mentored patient-oriented research career development award are to develop
tools to improve recognition of kidney disease risks among extremely preterm born children and to support the
development of Dr. Keia Sanderson into an independent investigator. Dr. Sanderson is a motivated clinical
researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), with a specific interest in early recognition
of kidney disease in children. Over the next 3 years, Dr. Sanderson will work with her mentorship committee
toward her goal of independence building upon her prior 3 years of KL2-supported training. Her mentorship
committee includes experts in long-term neonatal outcomes research (O’Shea, Laughon), neonatal nephrology
(Askenazi), machine learning (Kosorok), qualitative research (Flythe), and clinical decision support science
(Kistler). Each member has an established track record of mentoring junior faculty, consistent peer-reviewed
support, and high research productivity. Dr. Sanderson’s career development objectives are to: 1) gain multi-
center research leadership experience; 2) develop skills in machine learning methods for large data risk
stratification; 3) develop qualitative research skills to support practical application of machine learning models;
4) acquire skills in research mentorship; and 5) improve publication and grant writing in preparation for NIH
R01 applications. The research and training environment at UNC is well established to support these
objectives. To achieve her career development objectives, Dr. Sanderson will participate in structured
coursework, conduct mentored research, and workshops through North Carolina Translational and Clinical
Sciences Institute R-Writing Group. The specific aims of this research project are to 1) utilize machine learning
approaches within large databases of prenatal, neonatal, and early life exposure variables to predict kidney
disease in adolescents born extremely premature; 2) develop and evaluate the usability and acceptability of a
prototype web-based risk stratification tool for pediatric kidney disease after extremely preterm birth using
variables hypothesized to predict kidney disease. Expanding on two existing prospective cohorts (Extremely
Low Gestational Age Newborn-Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ELGAN-ECHO) and the
Preterm Erythropoietin Neuroprotection Trial (PENUT) cohorts), Dr. Sanderson will utilize clinical variables to
identify the combination of “at-highest risk,” and “at-risk” predictors for pediatric chronic kidney disease in
children after extremely preterm birth. This research will be the basis for R-level NIH applications to develop a
finalized web-based risk prediction tool informed by this proposal for public dissemination, to expand the use of
machine learning derived risk stratification tools to other medically complex pediatric populations, and to test
whether use of risk prediction tools increases the use of critical interventions (e.g. angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitors) to prevent kidney disease progression in high risk children."
10854780,"Suicide has been an increasingly prominent health concern among Veterans over the past 20 years. The
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide calls for robust and
innovative solutions to existing suicide prevention efforts, including improvements to existing psychotherapeutic
interventions. Effective suicide prevention interventions should identify and target mechanisms of suicide risk in
the most efficient manner possible. One strategy includes a skills-based approach to reducing psychological
inflexibility (cf. distress) related to suicidal ideation, thereby preventing suicidal thoughts from progressing to
more severe forms of self-directed violence. Moreover, distilling these treatment components into a format that
is more easily disseminated (i.e., single session, web-based) would improve Veteran access to effective suicide
prevention interventions. Unfortunately, few clinical suicide prevention interventions have adopted either of these
approaches, and none to date appear to have combined them in a manner that would provide an effective
adjunctive suicide-specific intervention that could be administered across both traditional and non-traditional
(e.g., primary care, emergency clinics) mental health settings. To that end, the Principal Investigator (PI)
previously developed and tested a web-based intervention designed to reduce psychological inflexibility related
to suicidal ideation, termed Re-Evaluating Suicidal Thoughts (REST). In a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of 98
non-Veteran outpatients, REST reduced psychological inflexibility and severity of suicidal ideation compared to
controls. In a one-arm acceptability trial of 24 Veteran outpatients, REST was rated as highly relevant, helpful,
and easy to use. The objective of the current proposal is therefore to evaluate the effectiveness of REST as an
adjunctive suicide prevention intervention among Veterans in an integrated health care setting. The specific aims
are to: evaluate the effect of REST on psychological inflexibility of suicidal ideation (Aim 1); evaluate the effect
of REST on suicidal ideation severity and self-directed violence (Aim 2); and identify the therapeutic mechanism
of REST in reducing suicidal ideation severity (Aim 3). Primary hypotheses include: compared to controls, REST
will result in lower psychological inflexibility of suicidal ideation at one-week follow-up (Hypothesis 1) and lower
suicidal ideation severity and reported self-directed violence at one-month follow-up (Hypothesis 2a and b); and
that reductions in psychological inflexibility will account for reductions in suicidal ideation severity and self-
directed violence (Hypothesis 3a and b). To accomplish these aims, the PI will recruit Veterans with current
suicidal ideation (N = 150) to be randomized to receive REST or maintain treatment-as-usual (TAU control). Self-
report measures of psychological inflexibility and severity of suicidal ideation will be administered at pre-
intervention, one-week, and one-month follow-up. Reports of self-directed violence (e.g., plans, preparatory
behaviors, and attempts) will be collected via clinical interview at baseline, one-week, and one-month follow-up.
The aims of this study will in part address key aspects of VA’s National Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide.
Specifically, this RCT “evaluate the effectiveness of Veteran suicide prevention interventions” (Objective 13.1).
Demonstrating the effectiveness of a web-based suicide prevention intervention will further “promote timely
access to intervention and effective care for Veterans with a heightened risk for suicide” (Objective 8.2). The
activities in this proposal will position the PI to become a leading independent investigator in VA with a focus on
clinical interventions for suicide prevention. The overall training goal of this proposal is to develop an expertise
in the development and empirical evaluation of scalable clinical interventions that address suicide risk. Training
aims include expertise in clinical trials research, clinical interventions for suicide risk, and leveraging technology
to enhance suicide prevention efforts. The research and training aims included herein will position the PI to
submit a VA Merit Award, grow a research program rooted in evidence-based approaches to Veteran suicide
prevention interventions, and become a leading clinical investigator in VA suicide prevention research."
10820413,"ABSTRACT
 The current coronavirus (CoV) pandemic, seasonal infections by other CoV and other “cold” viruses,
plus the need for annual influenza vaccinations exemplify the challenges posed by viral antigenic drift and shift.
Targeting landscapes of viral structural proteins displayed on the surfaces of virus particles and or the surfaces
of infected cells has been the primary basis for developing antibody-based therapeutics. Although great
advances have been made in trying to identify regions of these surface displayed proteins that are conserved
and less prone to “escape” antibody binding, it appears to be a continual battle of cat and mouse as we are
seeing with continual emergence of CoV “Variants of Concern”. In contrast, viral structural proteins that remain
inside virus particles and cells, avoid the impact of cyclical antibody selection, and tend to be far more
conserved. Oligomeric assemblies of these proteins can also blunt the impact of antiviral escape mutations
owing to the mix of mutant and wild-type monomers present in the parent cell. Furthermore, the stoichiometry
required of an antiviral to impede oligomer function need not be necessarily 1 antiviral to 1 monomer since,
especially if the antiviral were a crosslinker, its impact would be relayed beyond the immediate contact to
neighboring oligomers. Our long-term hypothesis is that affinity reagents capable of binding an internal
oligomeric structural protein of all species of a viral genus uniformly will impede viral assembly when present
as dimeric crosslinkers in a manner that is both forward capable and has much reduced susceptibility to viral
escape. We will explore the antiviral potential of dimeric crosslinkers using viruses of the genus Ebolavirus as
our model and a novel, rare nanobody manifesting uniform reactivity to nucleoprotein of all 6 species. Our two
specific aims are: (1) we will engineer mammalian cell expression vectors encoding nanobody homodimers
and assess antiviral activity using virus like particle surrogates at BSL-2 following plasmid transfection to drive
intrabody expression, (2) we will engineer E. coli expression vectors encoding nanobody homodimers fused to
cell penetrating peptides and glycosaminoglycan binding motifs and assess antiviral activity following protein
transduction of virus infected cells at BSL-4. Success will demonstrate a novel antiviral strategy that can then
be thoroughly explored for the propensity to select escape mutants relative to an existing neutralizing antibody
regime to test whether the strategy is more “escape-proof”. The overall approach should be applicable to other
human viral pathogens by carefully retuning the affinity reagent, with adequate time and resources, to
maximize broad long-term impact in helping to safe guard human health."
10810724,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Preschool or kindergarten represents the start of children’s educational careers. These early educational
opportunities are viewed as critical investments because they offer a great deal of promise for improving
children’s school success (Phillips et al., 2017). With that said, there remain questions about how these early
experiences shape social and behavioral development (Huston et al., 2015). To date, much of the research on
these early years has focused on academic outcomes and examines only preschool or kindergarten. This is a
significant oversight given that schools are more than academic institutions (Rimm-Kaufman et al., 2002) and
children’s preschool experiences may shape their adaptation to kindergarten (Vitiello et al., 2020). Given the
key role early social and behavioral skills have in shaping later health and well-being (Jones et al., 2015),
understanding the ways in which they are shaped by classroom environments is a key public health question.
Given the above, understanding how malleable aspects of the preschool and kindergarten classroom, and the
alignment across them (or lack thereof), contribute to children’s development is key to ensuring that
investments in preschool are maximized. This is particularly important with regards to children’s social
behavioral development given findings that suggest the long-term benefits of early educational experiences
manifest through changes in these domains (e.g., Gray-Lobe et al., 2021). Despite this emerging pattern of
findings, our knowledge of the social behavioral benefits of early education has been greatly limited.
The current proposal seeks to further our understanding regarding the key aspects of children’s preschool and
kindergarten classroom experiences and their predictive associations with children’s social and behavioral
development. We plan to leverage three large, diverse, and longitudinal datasets of preschoolers and
kindergarteners that collectively allow for a more comprehensive assessment of children’s educational
experiences. We will use these data to: 1) examine what aspects of the kindergarten classroom context shape
children’s social and behavioral development, and how these patterns vary for children who did or did not
attend preschool; 2) determine the extent to which the alignment between preschool and kindergarten
classrooms shape children’s social and behavioral development; and 3) assess whether the development of
children from different subgroups is differentially shaped by aspects of the classroom environment.
This proposed work will generate much needed evidence across multiple data sources to provide insight into the
ways in which children’s early educational experiences contribute to their development of key social and
behavioral skills that lay the foundation for long-term development (Heckman, 2006). Such an understanding is
of increasing importance given the growing investments in early educational opportunities in the U.S."
10918032,"ABSTRACT.
The health status of hotel housekeepers hired through Non-Standard Work Arrangement (NSWA) is
understudied. Making up the majority of the 1.8 million workers in the hospitality industry, hotel housekeepers
(HHs) are likely to face alternative work arrangements because of several factors, including seasonal demands as
well as the overemphasis on cost and labor control. HHs already experience stress at work (e.g., high job strain)
and outside of work, and poor health. Thus, HHs hired through NSWA are likely to encounter heightened
suboptimal work experiences and poor economic and health-related outcomes. Yet there is a dearth of studies
exploring the health and lived experiences of hotel housekeepers employed through NSWA. Through the Healthy
Work Design and Well-Being program, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
identified NSWA as a research priority. NIOSH noted the vulnerability of workers hired through NSWA given
that it is characterized by “temporariness, instability, irregularity, and lack of legal protections and social benefits
for workers” all of which may negatively affect workers’ health and wellbeing. To address this federally identified
gap and in response to PAR-18-797-we propose to conduct a mixed-method sequential design study to
quantitatively (N=140) explore the health status of HHs hired through NSWA compared to HHs hired through
standard work (SW) and qualitatively (n=40) explore how the lived experiences and health status of the two
groups (NSWA vs. SW) differ. This project will contribute to NIOSH’s mission in three ways. (1) The study
responds to NIOSH’s Healthy Work Design and Well-Being program which identified NSWA as one of its priority
areas and the call for an understanding of risks and conditions associated with occupational diseases and
injuries. (2) This first descriptive exploratory study is necessary in laying the groundwork for future studies that
will help further our scientific knowledge of the relationship between NSWA and the health of HHs and other
worker groups. (3) The study findings will inform guidelines and policies on NSWA as well as future
interventions that can facilitate organizational change and support the individual worker. This study has several
innovative facets. First, it focuses on a vulnerable and understudied population, HHs. Second, this will be the
first study to explore the health status and lived experience of HHs hired through NSWA. Third, this study
incorporates the Identity, Research, and Health Dialogic Open-Ended (I-ReH-DO) interviewing approach which
allows for narrative discourse for understanding dynamics of social constructs influencing health. The mixed-
method approach brings scientific rigor making the study the first of its kind to include both quantitative and
qualitative methods to understand the complexity of the phenomenon of NSWA in relation to workers’ health.
Our educational experiences, research skills, previous studies, interdisciplinary team, and community-based
connections with local organizations ensure the success of this project."
10815571,"PROJECT SUMMARY
South Asians, comprised predominantly of Asian Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshi immigrants, are the
second fastest growing ethnic group in the United States. Our team has created the first longitudinal study of
South Asians called the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA), which has
demonstrated significantly poorer cardiovascular health in the aggregated South Asian population compared to
other major U.S. race/ethnic groups. However, MASALA has very limited information about the cardiovascular
health profiles for Pakistanis and Bangladeshis since MASALA included 83% Asian Indian but only 6%
Pakistani and 0.5% Bangladeshi immigrants. Studies from the South Asian subcontinent, the United Kingdom,
and Canada have shown significantly higher burden of cardiovascular disease among Bangladeshis and
Pakistanis compared to Indians. Socio-cultural context, including socioeconomic position, immigration history,
cultural background, and neighborhood factors vary across these three South Asian subgroups and affect how
immigrants experience and adjust to a new context, and how they activate resilience resources to cope with
stressors that impact cardiovascular health disparities. Our goal is to expand the MASALA study cohort to
include more Pakistani and Bangladeshi immigrants leveraging new and existing measures to characterize and
understand cardiovascular health disparities in immigrant populations. We propose to recruit 600 Bangladeshi
and 550 Pakistani adults between the age of 40-84 years from greater New York City and Chicago areas to
add to the ongoing MASALA cohort and compare them to Asian Indians enrolled in MASALA. Our specific
aims are to: 1) Determine whether and the extent to which Pakistani and Bangladeshi immigrants have worse
cardiovascular health (diet, physical activity, tobacco use, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity)
compared to Indian immigrants already enrolled in MASALA. 2) Identify multilevel risk and protective factors
associated with cardiovascular health within and across South Asian subgroups. Test whether acculturation
strategies and resilience resources mediate or moderate the association between socio-cultural context and
cardiovascular health and explain disparities across the three subgroups. 3) To further interpret our
quantitative results, conduct in-depth interviews to elucidate how immigration, acculturation, discrimination, and
resilience resources influence South Asians’ cardiovascular health. Studying diverse immigrant populations
advances the science of health disparities by understanding how biopsychosocial and ecological
characteristics may associate and interact with country of origin to influence cardiovascular health. Our mixed-
methods approach for studying the complex, multilevel interactions influencing cardiovascular health disparities
in South Asian immigrants offers promise for the development of more effective public health and clinical
prevention strategies to reduce CVD disparities."

Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (aGVHD) occurs due to donor T cell alloreactivity against host tissues and is
the major cause of non-relapse mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). Approximately
50% of patients are not responsive to front-line corticosteroid therapy and deemed “steroid-refractory” with
limited to no effective standard therapies. Our long-term research goal is to identify and evaluate innovative
approaches to improve patient outcomes by preventing and/or abrogating aGVHD toxicity post-alloSCT. The
proposed research presents pioneering clinical and translational approaches to target epigenetic regulation of
inflammatory mediators via Bromodomain and Extraterminal (BET) domain inhibition using novel non-
benzodiazepine structured PLX (51107 and 2853) to prevent and mitigate aGVHD. PLX boasts improved
pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles to benzodiazepine-scaffolded BET inhibitors. We observed that BET
inhibition with PLX results in potent suppression of T cell proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion
of IFN-g, IL-6, and TNF-α without affecting T cell viability. Our data also demonstrate that BET inhibition with
PLX significantly downregulates transcription of T cell costimulatory genes, major inflammatory cytokines, and
cell-cycle regulators. Importantly, we identified that BET inhibition decreases T cell proliferation and dampens
inflammation independent of STAT-1. Thus, we targeted JAK/STAT blockade with the recently FDA approved
JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib and observed synergistic effects of dual BET and JAK1/2 inhibition on T cell
proliferation. We hypothesize that BET inhibition with PLX is a feasible, effective strategy to mitigate T cell
mediated aGVHD inflammation as a single agent. Further, we propose preclinical analyses to assess the
synergistic mechanisms and tolerability of dual BET/JAK1/2 inhibition. Aim 1 of the proposed research tests
our hypothesis in a Phase 1b/2 proof-of-principle clinical trial for patients with steroid-refractory aGVHD with
single agent PLX51107. Correlative studies are designed to assess 1) response to therapy and 2) immune
reconstitution of T cell subsets. In Aim 2, we will use preclinical models of aGVHD to test the hypothesis that
BET inhibition results in improvement in aGVHD survival by downregulating Th1 and Th17 pathogenic T cell
responses while maintaining Treg mediated tolerance. We observed a very strong reduction in expression of
Th1/Th17 pro-inflammatory genes such as IFN- g, IL-17 and IL-2 as well as co-stimulatory molecule CD40L
with PLX treated T cells in vitro. We propose to analyze the effects of PLX on individual T cell subsets and their
implications in aGVHD pathogenesis in vivo. Aim 3 will 1) test the hypothesis that dual BET and JAK1/2
inhibition will reduce GVHD and prolong duration of treatment response; and 2) assess the effects of
combination therapy on Treg and effector T cell function. These experiments will determine the future
applicability of T cell subset directed therapy for aGVHD as well as inform the development of future clinical
trials combining BET and JAK1/2 inhibition for aGVHD prevention or treatment indications."

 The world's population is aging. The resulting prevalence and ability to provide quality care for older
individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) and other chronic illnesses is a challenge
our society must address. Our vision is to address this challenge by providing a diverse body of undergraduate
students with the scientific, clinical, and research experience needed to understand health-assistive technology
and design technological solutions that aid with the challenges of aging and improve human health.
Undergraduates in neuroscience, psychology, sociology, computer science, and engineering (MSTEM)
programs as well as those in healthcare-related disciplines need a strong multi-disciplinary background to be
truly prepared for research in applying technology to gerontology issues. The objective of this renewal
application is to continue to enhance and lead a research training program for undergraduate students in the
fields of gerontology and technology-based assistive environments. This will be done through course work,
summer research programs, online materials and professional symposia to help other institutions develop
similar programs. The ultimate goal is to bring up a diverse generation of new graduate student researchers
and innovators who understand the need of continued work in the field for addressing the aging population
issues and begin their research careers prepared for gerontechnology oriented research. To accomplish our
goal, we will refine and offer a gerontechnology class that is geared toward multidisciplinary undergraduate
students (Aim 1). We will also refine and offer a gerontechnology-focused summer undergraduate research
experience (GSUR) program that will provide a team-based research opportunity for highly-qualified students
(Aim 2). To broaden the impact of the training program, we will offer mentoring support for senior capstone
projects and independent and clinical training projects related to gerontechnology (Aim 3). Finally, we will
broaden the impact of our program by disseminating training materials through online classes, Youtube videos,
and podcasts, and presenting methods and results of the training program at high-visibility gerontology and
technology meetings (Aim 4). In all of these efforts we will recruit and involve a diverse student body, including
women in STEM, minorities, persons with disabilities and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. The
proposed program is innovative because Gerontechnology-related undergraduate programs with a true multi-
disciplinary core are rare. The combination of serving both the local student body, summer students from
other programs, and individuals from outside the university through online materials, open seminars, and
workshops will bolster the quality, quantity, and diversity of highly prepared upcoming graduate researchers.
The project is significant because it will introduce many undergraduates to the issues faced by our society in
the coming decades, as well as prepare many of them to help develop new approaches to health care through
melding technology with traditional medical approaches."
10839795,"Program Summary
The main objectives of Graduate Training in Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology (GTMCP) at the University of
Wisconsin (UW)-Madison are to provide predoctoral-level training in interdisciplinary research at the forefront of
quantitative and systems pharmacology and a nucleus around which interdepartmental faculty, students, and
scientists from across campus can meet and collaborate. Its overall mission is to provide a highly diverse group
of trainees with the skills necessary to enter careers related to the Pharmacological Sciences in academia,
industry, government, science education, and public policy. Discovering new approaches to drug delivery and
developing novel drugs as therapeutics are cornerstones of the program, with a major emphasis on
understanding pathways that are relevant to disease. To accomplish these goals, the curriculum focuses on
delivering foundational knowledge in Pharmacology, including mechanisms of drug action, pharmacokinetics,
and pharmacodynamics, stressing quantitative thinking and the value of -omic technologies. Carefully evaluated
coursework centered on the importance of rigor and reproducibility, responsible conduct of research, safety
within the laboratory, and grant writing promote the development of trained PhD scientists who can contribute to
the biomedical research workforce. A core group of 29 dedicated faculty trainers has been assembled for this
application, representing 10 departments, whose interests focus on understanding molecular, cellular, and
physiological mechanisms by which drugs or natural ligands interact with cellular receptors and elicit effects in
biological systems. All trainers have robust research programs and were selected based on a demonstrated
commitment to mentoring graduate students in Pharmacology. Faculty members work in the interdisciplinary
areas of Neuropharmacology, Cancer Pharmacology, Cardiovascular Pharmacology, Endocrine Pharmacology,
and Immunopharmacology, and collaborate extensively with one another to create a highly interactive network.
Each trainer has received extensive mentor training and understands the importance of strong mentor-mentee
relationships in establishing an inclusive and supportive research environment. GTMCP leverages strong
institutional support and substantial resources to facilitate the professional development of its trainees. Through
its well-funded seminar series, all trainees are provided regular opportunities to develop excellent oral
presentation skills and invite outside faculty speakers from top institutions across the country. Research retreats
and symposia offer additional opportunities for students to host and interact with prominent members of the
Pharmacology community and develop networking skills. GTMCP also boasts considerable trainee diversity, a
high retention rate, a rapid time to degree, and an excellent record of trainee publications. Ten slots to support
trainees for two years of their early graduate education are requested based on the growing demand for PhD-
level scientists trained in Pharmacology and the high quality of students that apply to UW-Madison."
10839825,"The Graduate Program in Molecular Pharmacology & Physiology is a small and very diverse
program with a strong set of courses and activities, as well as extensive mentoring mechanisms.
Leadership of the program is by a group of three accomplished MPIs with complementary
strengths and expertise that guarantee effective oversight of the program. The request is for 4
T32 slots per year; the total number of students in the program is 20. This training program in
""Interdisciplinary Training in Pharmacological Sciences"" will replace our current NIGMS
pharmacology T32, ending in June of 2021. The training in our program focuses on fundamental
principles of pharmacology, rigor and reproducibility, and cutting-edge quantitative methods. Our
trainees participate in many activities that promote interaction, collaboration and professional
development. Here we propose a number of new initiatives in the curriculum, professional
development, program oversight and recruitment. A recent innovative initiative we are developing
in the program is the establishment of summer internships at Pfizer pharmaceutical company
labs; these internships will give our trainees the unique opportunity to experience first-hand the
scientific environment in a pharmaceutical company and make informed decisions for their future
careers. Our current admissions and recruitment practices have yielded a high percentage of
students from disadvantaged and underrepresented groups (in the last 5 years, 47%
underrepresented minorities plus 7% disabled), and there has been 100% retention of these
students in the program during the last 15 years (retention for the program in general is 95%).
The career outcomes of the students are excellent, with 52% of students staying in academia
(25% faculty, 27% currently postdocs) often at top institutions, about 25% as scientists in
pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, and the remainder in a variety of science and
medicine- related careers. Thus, our program has been training a highly diverse group of students
who have become successful in different areas of science; the new initiatives proposed in our
T32 application will further enhance our unique program and improve the quality of the training."
10845512,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hemorrhage is a common occurrence inside and outside of the clinical environment. Although advancements
have been made to enable rapid hemostatic control, hemorrhage is still a significant contributor to morbidity and
mortality. Current approaches to achieve hemostatic control focus on pharmacological and electrothermal means
of intervention. These methods of addressing hemorrhage are effective; however, they are not broadly applicable
and are associated with numerous adverse effects. The pharmacological methods rely on the use of biologic
agents that present the risks of infection and immune dysregulation. Electrothermal means of addressing
hemorrhage, such as electrocauterization often result in compromised tissue appearance and function. To
address this need for improved hemostatic agents, we propose the use of microscale electrical fields to
accelerate hemostasis, which has been demonstrated by our previous work. A fundamental question pertains to
the mechanistic underpinnings of microscale-electrical-field hemostatic augmentation. The central hypothesis is
that tunable (low voltage) electrical fields catalyze pro-hemostatic fibrin deposition and endothelial mechanics.
This hypothesis will be investigated by the following proposed specific aims. Aim 1 will establish the mechanism
underlying microscale-electrical-field hemostatic augmentation. The objective is to understand how microscale
electrical fields target hemostasis in comparison to current hemostatic agents. Aim 2 will use novel in vitro
models of blood vessels to characterize how blood vessel cells respond to electrical fields in the context of
bleeding. The trainee will master a wide range of engineering, chemistry, and biological techniques, including
nanofabrication, microsystem engineering using microfluidics, and advanced microscopy techniques. The
laboratory in which the proposed work will be conducted is the ideal environment for this research trainee as it
has demonstrated an abundance of resources and numerous opportunities for cross-training in fields ranging
from life sciences to engineering all of which will foster the well-roundedness of the trainee. The proposed
research will provide insight into a novel approach to accelerating hemostasis using microscale electrical fields.
This research will provide a strong foundation for future medical microsystem- based strategies for evaluating
disease and treatment options. The training plan proposed to accomplish these goals has been specifically
designed to provide the PI with the environment, training, and mentorship necessary to succeed as a physician-
scientist-engineer."

Intellectual disability (ID) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder affecting more than 1 in 100
individuals worldwide. Recent genetic studies have linked numerous cases of ID to variants in
proteins that modify the chemical structure of RNA. However, the mechanisms by which tRNA
modification enzymes influence brain development are enigmatic. Here, we focus on deciphering
the biological role of tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TRMT1), a tRNA modification enzyme important
for human neurodevelopment. Individuals with TRMT1 mutations exhibit cognitive deficits, growth
delay and brain abnormalities early in age. We have discovered that TRMT1 modifies more than
half of all tRNAs in mammalian cells and is required for the stability of certain tRNAs. Moreover,
loss of TRMT1 in human cells causes proliferation defects and up-regulation of pathways involved
in protein folding. To understand the function of TRMT1 in neurodevelopment, we have generated
a novel TRMT1-deficient mouse strain which exhibits brain and developmental abnormalities.
Based upon these findings, we propose that TRMT1-catalyzed modifications play a critical role in
the biogenesis and function of tRNAs to ensure proper levels of protein synthesis during
mammalian growth and development. In our first Aim, we will use new tRNA sequencing
technologies to determine the role of TRMT1-catalyzed modifications in tRNA stability and
function. In our second Aim, we will use ribosome profiling approaches to decipher the role of
TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modification in translation. For our final Aim, we will define the
spatiotemporal requirement for TRMT1 in mouse brain development. Altogether, the proposed
research will forge new connections between RNA modification, protein synthesis and
neurodevelopment."
10850698,"ABSTRACT
Genes associated with asthma are often expressed in airway epithelium, and such epithelium
regulates immune responses to environmental challenges and airway inflammation. Thus,
epigenetic regulation and gene expression in airway epithelium could be key to asthma
pathogenesis. Indeed, we recently identified biologically plausible DNA methylation and
transcriptomic markers of atopic asthma in airway (nasal) epithelium of children and adolescents
of Puerto Rican, African American, and European descent. Such markers are located in or near
genes related to immune regulation and airway epithelial integrity and function, yet most were not
identified by GWAS. Moreover, we developed nasal methylation and transcriptomic profiles that
accurately classified subjects by atopic asthma in a cross-sectional study. In contrast to these
findings in children, little is known about the underlying mechanisms or predictors of asthma in
Hispanic adults, including Puerto Rican and Dominican adults. Lack of such knowledge is an
important problem, because, without it, gaining the ability to prevent or treat asthma morbidity in
this underserved group is highly unlikely. The Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos
(HCHS/SOL) provides a unique opportunity to examine DNA methylation and gene expression in
airway epithelium and asthma, lung function, and asthma outcomes in Puerto Rican and
Dominican adults. On the basis of our novel preliminary results, we hypothesize that altered
expression of genes that regulate airway epithelial function and immune responses are
associated with asthma, lung function, and asthma severity or control in Puerto Rican and
Dominican adults. To test this hypothesis, we will first conduct a genome-wide (GW) study of
association between DNA methylation in nasal (airway) epithelium from 900 Puerto Rican and
Dominican adults in HCHS/SOL and asthma, lung function and lung function decline, and asthma
control or severity, and develop predictive or classification models of asthma outcomes (Sp. Aim
1). We will then perform a GW study of association between gene expression in nasal epithelium
in the same subjects as in Sp. Aim 1 and asthma, lung function and lung function decline, and
asthma control or severity, and develop predictive or classification models of asthma outcomes.
Next, we will conduct expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis and expression
quantitative trait methylation (eQTM) analyses to integrate the results from available GW
genotypic data with those from the analyses of methylation and expression (conducted in Sp.
Aims 1 and 2), and perform a pathway analysis and functional validation studies for the top genes.
This proposal will address an important, yet unstudied, aspect of asthma “omics”: the identification
of epigenomic and transcriptomic markers and/or determinants of asthma outcomes among adults
in two Hispanic subgroups at intermediate to high risk of asthma (Dominicans and Puerto Ricans).
To achieve this goal, we have assembled an outstanding multidisciplinary research team."

Age-related vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), a subgroup of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementias (ADRD) is a common cause of disability and reduced quality of life among the elderly. Extensive recent
data have demonstrated that microvascular pathologies in the brain play a central role in these processes. One such
pathology is cerebral microhemorrhages (CMH) which are the result of rupture of small intracerebral blood vessels
and progressively impairs neuronal function. The incidence of CMH dramatically increases with age and hypertension
is one of the major causes for age-related cognitive decline. Yet the underlying cellular mechanisms for CMH and
increased vascular fragility are unknown, and thus therapeutic interventions to mitigate CMH are not available. Blood
vessel integrity requires plasticity of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which exhibit an adaptive switch from a
highly contractile to a protective, anti-fragility phenotype in response to stress. Aging fundamentally alters VSMC
phenotypic switching, suppressing the adoption of these protective VSMC features, which are otherwise promoted
by insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1. Circulating IGF-1 levels are dramatically decreased with age. Low IGF-1 levels
increase the risk for cerebromicrovascular disease and promote the development of CMH in our rodent models,
supporting a role for IGF-1 deficiency in age-related vascular fragility. Our hypothesis is that impaired VSMC
plasticity and function due to IGF-1 deficiency has a fundamental role in increased cerebrovascular fragility and
development of CMH and cognitive decline with age. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that VSMCs contribute to the
development of VCID/ADRD phenotypes in IGF-1 signaling-deficient models. We will use novel VSMC-specific IGF-
1 receptor knockout lines to probe the role of VSMCs in the development of CMH, impaired myogenic autoregulation
in response to hypertension, and the consequent development of cognitive decline. Aim 2 will determine the
dynamic balance between VSMCs with maladaptive phenotypes and VSMCs with protective phenotypes induced
by age-dependent decrease of IGF1. In this aim we will address the question of VSMC plasticity in vivo,
evaluating both protective and maladaptive VSMC phenotypes in the cerebrovasculature of Igf1r-deficient CMH
models. Aim 3 will evaluate the transcriptional mechanisms governing maladaptive and protective VSMC
phenotypes in regions of vascular fragility/CMH and in surrounding intact vessels. Lineage tracing genetic mouse
models of aging and IGF-1 deficiency, coupled with single-cell RNA-sequencing, will be used to evaluate the
role of novel transcriptional regulators in the adoption of diverse VSMC phenotypes. Pro- and anti-fragility VSMC
phenotypic states will be spatially overlaid with the location of CMH to test the hypothesis that CMH occur
primarily in regions where VSMCs show a maladaptive phenotype. These scientifically and technically innovative
studies will significantly enhance our understanding of the role of IGF-1 deficiency in the development of CMH
and will provide insight into underlying cellular mechanisms which are critical for the development of effective
therapies."

Vascular smooth muscle (SM) and endothelial cells (EC) coordinate the molecular signals governing arterial
vasoreactivity. The balance of constrictor and relaxant signals establishes vessel tone and directly influences
systemic blood pressure in health and disease. Our laboratory has uncovered novel and paradoxical roles for
Notch signaling in the vessel wall that influence arterial function. Specifically, SM Notch receptors triggered by
SM Jagged1 ligand promote myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) expression and Ca2+ sensitization inducing
myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, the molecular signature of force production. Mice lacking SM
Jagged1 feature dysregulated blood pressure and pressor responses and arteries exhibit impaired force
generation. In contrast, EC Dll4 ligand stimulates expression of SM MYPT1, the regulatory subunit of myosin
phosphatase (MP), favoring dephosphorylation of MLC and a relaxant phenotype. Moreover, EC Dll4-deficient
arteries yield vasorelaxation deficits in a novel NO-independent manner. Together, these findings underscore
instructional Notch signaling through heterotypic (EC-SM) and homotypic (SM-SM) cell interactions in the
vessel wall and provide new knowledge in the molecular determinants of vasoregulation. The overall goal in
this new project proposal is to define the physiologically relevant Notch ligand/receptor that modulates distinct
arterial functions. In Aim 1, we determine the contribution of both SM and EC Jagged1 ligand and Notch1
receptor in regulation of constrictor and hemodynamic responses in vascular health and disease animal
models. Aim 2 delineates the physiological role and mechanism of EC Dll4 ligand in mediating arterial
relaxation. Finally, Aim 3 examines the molecular basis for Notch signaling-dependent control of myosin
phosphatase activity via Ca2+ sensitization and/or desensitization. Experimental approaches include a full
spectrum of in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro vascular analyses necessary for understanding relevant physiology and
novel molecular mechanisms through which Notch pathway components regulate arterial function."

critical issues in drug development, by providing them the tools and knowledge to navigate the ever-
changing, interdisciplinary landscape that makes up today’s basic, translational, and clinical research. This
integrated T32 program is designed to create leaders in the broadly defined field of Pharmacological Sciences.
TIPS will provide interdisciplinary training in drug development including screening, computation, medicinal
chemistry, and structural biology relevant to target discovery and validation, and an understanding of
regulatory issues involved in advancing candidate therapeutics to clinical application. Through the participation
of 3 premier and neighboring biomedical research institutions and their graduate schools (University of Texas
Health Science Center at Houston, Baylor College of Medicine, and Rice University), TIPS will provide
interdisciplinary training, career development activities and industry shadowships that will prepare students to
advance biomedical research through successful careers in academia, government and regulatory agencies,
and industry. Program leadership includes the program director and co-director and a steering committee of
representatives from the participating graduate programs, along with an external advisory committee of diverse
experts. TIPS program requirements and benefits will include co-mentoring from two faculty in a collaborative
research project; specific didactic and elective courses (available to TIPS trainees at all participating schools);
monthly trainee meetings to build a unified cohort; a wide variety of career development activities, and required
training in the responsible conduct of research and rigor and reproducibility. Mentors will include 31 faculty
members at 3 institutions, working in 14 graduate programs, who have training and research expertise in
drug/compound screening, pharmacology, computation, medicinal chemistry, structural biology, systems
biology, biochemistry, genetics, and molecular and cellular biology. All participating departments recruit
nationwide, especially for students of diverse backgrounds who are under-represented in the biomedical
sciences, including individuals with disabilities, from disadvantaged backgrounds, and from under-represented
racial and ethnic groups. This provides a large, diverse pool of predoctoral students from a variety of
backgrounds for our 5 requested slots. Students will apply to TIPS after joining a lab near the end of their first
year or during their second year of graduate school, and if selected through a holistic application process, will
receive two years of support. Reappointment to a second year will be contingent on a thorough oral and written
review of trainee research progress and completion of program requirements. TIPS will complement the
degree requirements of a trainee’s home institution, causing no delay in degree completion. The
interdisciplinary skills emphasized by this program will produce pharmacology scientists well positioned to
advance biomedical research and to address the complexity of drug development."

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can prevent HIV infection among persons who inject drugs (PWID). However,
PrEP use among PWID is low and there have been several recent HIV outbreaks among PWID throughout the
United States. Few studies have focused on PrEP for PWID although many PWID are eligible for PrEP. A
significant barrier to PrEP for PWID is stigma (i.e., social devaluation and discrediting), especially stigma
related to drug use, which can translate into negative healthcare interactions and/or healthcare avoidance as
well as healthcare providers being less willing to prescribe PrEP to PWID. PWID may have multiple
characteristics that could be stigmatized such as drug use, race/ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, and poverty,
as well as stigma attributed to HIV and PrEP. In addition, PWID may experience stigma at the organizational
level (e.g., in healthcare, drug treatment, pharmacies, or syringe exchange programs) or at the structural level
in the form of state policies. It is important to understand how these multiple characteristics create unique
stigma experiences (i.e., intersectional stigma – stigma characteristics that are experienced simultaneously)
among sub-populations of PWID that could affect PrEP and service use. The purpose of this research is to
understand intersectional stigma among PWID and how it affects PrEP and other service use though the
following specific aims: (1) Identify sub-populations of PWID that display different patterns of stigma due to
drug use, race/ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, and poverty; (2) examine associations of patterns of stigma
with PrEP willingness and uptake and other service-related variables over time; (3) evaluate how and if
covariates (sociodemographic variables, HIV and PrEP stigma, and structural stigma by state) moderate
associations of stigma with PrEP use and other service use. The results of this study will inform PrEP
implementation broadly, as well as inform the development of stigma and PrEP interventions tailored to sub-
populations of PWID. The research project is part of a comprehensive training program designed to facilitate
Dr. Walters transition to research independence. Training aims include (1) Building topical expertise in
intersectional stigma experienced by PWID; (2) Develop methodological expertise in latent variable modeling
and effect modification; (3) Gain training in intervention science; (4) Gain expertise in ethical conduct of
research pertaining to HIV prevention among PWID; and (5) Strengthen professional skills for a successful
independent research career."
10829359,"Project Summary 
Most of the studies on epigenetic inheritance focus on the identification of sperm-borne factors that carry 
the epigenetic memory and how they act on the epigenome/genome of the embryos so that the specific 
epigenetic memory can be recalled and manifested as a specific phenotype in offspring. However, one 
fundamental question remains unanswered: given that the effects of exposures, either environmental or 
dietary, are presumably initially manifested as epigenetic changes in directly exposed somatic cells (e.g. 
pancreatic islet cells, adipocytes, hepatocytes, etc.), how do the phenotype-specific epimutations in 
somatic cells get transduced into spermatozoa? Using a highly reproducible mouse model for 
intergenerational epigenetic inheritance of a high fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic disorders, we here 
propose a series of experiments to tackle this critical question. Our central hypothesis is that HFD- 
induced epimutations in somatic cells can lead to production of specific sncRNAs that are either 
encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs), or present as mobile RNAs, which act as the carrier of 
epigenetic memory once internalized by spermatozoa through either 1) the intra-testicular mechanism 
(i.e., Sertoli cell HDF-specific epigenetic information transmitted to all developing male germ cells or 
directly to spermatozoa during spermatogenesis in the testis), or 2) the post-testicular pathway (i.e., 
HFD-specific epigenetic information transmitted from male reproductive tract epithelial cells to 
spermatozoa), or 3) a combination of both. To test our hypothesis, we propose to identify when and 
where male germ cells gain the ability to transmit the HDF-induced metabolic disorder phenotype (Aim1), 
to study how the intra-testicular pathway contributes to the HFD-specific sperm epigenome (Aim2), to 
study how the post-testicular pathway influences HFD-specific sperm epigenome (Aim3). Data to be 
obtained will help fill the knowledge gap in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying 
the intergenerational epigenetic inheritance of paternally acquired traits in general."

The proposal outlines a research and training plan for Obada Shamaa, MD, PhD, to perform postdoctoral work
in the laboratory of Gokhan Mutlu, MD, for two years. The ultimate goal of this research project is to provide
novel insights into the how glutamine metabolism plays a role in Influenza A-induced Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome (IAV-induced ARDS), a disease associated with significant mortality and limited therapeutic options.
This work will be the foundation for becoming a K-level grant. During this mentored period, Dr. Shamaa will gain
expertise in metabolism and techniques to study bioenergetics, redox states, and metabolomics as well as
enhance his previous cellular and molecular biology skills. In addition to mentoring by Dr. Mutlu and a
multidisciplinary Research Monitoring Committee (RMC), Dr. Shamaa will supplement his training with
educational opportunities provided at the University of Chicago. The overall research goal is to identify how
glutamine metabolism is involved in influenza A replication and alveolar macrophage effector function. Metabolic
adaptations to support immune cell function, as well as by influenza A virus (IAV) to support viral replication.
While it is thought that macrophages increase aerobic glycolysis metabolism to support a pro-inflammatory
macrophage response, recent work by the Mutlu lab showed that tissue-resident alveolar macrophages (TR-
AMs) rely solely on mitochondrial respiration to support their effector function. Dr. Shamaa now has confirmatory
data that TR-AMs increase expression of glutaminolysis enzymes in response to IAV infection. Additionally, he
has shown that IAV replication and pro-inflammatory cytokine release is reduced in TR-AMs in the absence of
exogenous glutamine. These data indicate that active regulation of glutamine is critical for IAV replication and
TR-AMs’ effector function. Aim 1 will evaluate the role of glutamine metabolism in IAV viral replication and TR-
AM effector response. Aim 2 will focus on the metabolic changes in TR-AMs infected with IAV following targeting
of glutamine metabolism. The proposed work will require training in bioenergetics and liquid chromatography-
mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and Dr. Shamaa will obtain training in both techniques during this fellowship. This
work seeks to understand how glutamine is utilized in alveolar macrophages following IAV infection as there is
a significant need to identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions for IAV-induced ARDS."

Many incurable neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntingtin's feature the
presence of toxic misfolded proteins. These insoluble protein aggregates, amyloid fibrils (AF), have been
extensively studied and structural characterization has shown that they are largely composed of β-sheets and an
ordered cross-β fibril core; however, they are often framed by intrinsically disordered domains (IDDs) in the N
and C-terminal. Adding to the complex nature of AFs is the finding that many of them, including α-synuclein
(α-syn), amyloid-β, and tau, are found as polymorphs. Polymorphism, in this context, enables a protein to fold
and self-propagate into different AF structures often accompanied by varying neuropathology. The high
flexibility of the IDDs has made it difficult to take their molecular picture thus limiting our understanding of how
they affect AF properties in disease. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of studying the IDDs of
AF as they have been found to play an important role in mediating fibril toxicity, aggregation, and interactions
with cellular components. α-Syn is natively found as a soluble intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), but in
Parkinson's disease it misfolds and aggregates into AF found in Lewy bodies. The importance of α-syn in disease
context has resulted in numerous studies of its monomeric and fibrillar form, thus the fibril core of α-syn is well-
characterized and there are several high-resolution structures available including at least four polymorph
structures. This makes α-syn an ideal candidate to determine the differences in structure and dynamics of the
IDDs in the monomeric and fibrillar state and between polymorphs. To accomplish this, I will use solid-state
nuclear magnetic resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in combination with molecular
dynamics simulations to develop two full-length α-syn models that will describe the dynamic and structural
properties of IDDs in fibrils and it will provide insight on the effects of polymorphism on the IDDs. In addition,
polymorphs will be tested for toxicity in a neural cell culture model. This research will provide fundamental
understanding of AF that can help future studies that focus on understanding how IDDs mediate toxicity, fiber-
cell interactions, and seeding properties."

The goal of this project proposal is to advance our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie longitudinal
social bond development in children and their pet dogs. The strength of the social bonds that form between
children and their pet dogs is thought to mediate the positive therapeutic effects of having a pet dog, yet the
mechanisms involved in the longitudinal development of these social bonds are not well characterized. The
overall objective of this study is to determine how social bonds between children and their pet dogs develop,
and to examine the anxiolytic effects of these social bonds in order to more effectively facilitate child health and
wellbeing. The specific aims of this project are 1) to assess the relationship between social bond strength,
oxytocin levels, and functional responses within social reward-related brain circuits in dogs and children, and 2)
to determine whether social bond strength is associated with cortisol levels and functional connectivity within
stress-related brain circuits in dogs and children. These aims will be achieved by assessing changes in social
bond strength between child-dog dyads across four timepoints: within one week of dog adoption, two months
post-adoption, five months post-adoption, and eight months post-adoption. At each timepoint, social bond
strength will be measured via a behavioral task, and salivary samples will be collected from the child and the
dog at the start and end of the behavioral testing session to measure changes in hormone level throughout the
session. Brain activity will be measured following behavioral testing using fMRI techniques. Through the
integration of behavioral, endocrinological, and neural methodologies, we will obtain a full perspective of the
longitudinal process of social bond formation in child-dog dyads that can be generalized across the broader
population. The proposed study aligns with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development’s
Child Development and Behavior Branch of Human Animal Interaction’s mission of enhancing the lives of
children. The results of this study will directly influence child wellbeing by allowing us to better understand the
mechanisms involved in the formation of social bonds between children and pet dogs over time, which will lay
the foundation for informing therapeutic outcomes in future clinical populations."

The five-year training and research project outlined in this application will foster the career of Dr. Abigail
Greenleaf, an already accomplished scholar in cell phone-based cross-sectional data collection in sub-Saharan
Africa to master high-frequency, longitudinal sexual and reproductive health studies. With the proposed career
development and research activities, the candidate will be poised to make significant contributions in the field of
international sexual and reproductive population studies. This Mentored Research Scientist Development award
is designed to meet Dr. Greenleaf’s near-term career development goal of understanding contraceptive
dynamics – adoption, continuation, discontinuation, and switching – among adolescent girls and young women
in a high HIV prevalence setting (Eswatini), and to meet her overarching career goal to become an independent
scholar who advances knowledge of sexual and reproductive health. Thus, the K01 research will be supported
by mentor-guided career development training in four complementary areas to facilitate her long-term research
goals. To enrich her reproductive health scholarship, Dr. Greenleaf will be (1) trained in sociology theories of
pregnancy desire. To (2) analyze high-frequency longitudinal data, she requires skills in advanced statistical
methods. She will (3) gain expertise in prevention and risk of HIV acquisition. Finally, to become an independent
NIH-funded investigator, Dr. Greenleaf will (4) undertake professional development activities. This innovative
proposal aligns with a key scientific priority of NICHD Population Dynamics Branch: studying contraceptive use
and non-use. The research plan has three aims: (1) Investigate how changing states (schooling, income,
residential mobility) impact contraceptive use; (2) Examine the relationship between pregnancy desires and
contraceptive use; (3) Test whether changes in a woman’s perception of her HIV risk changes her probability of
contraceptive use and HIV prevention behaviors. Career development and research activities will be supervised
by a team of mentors including primary mentor Dr. Elaine Abrams, Professor of Epidemiology and Pediatrics at
Columbia University and two co-mentors: Dr. Jennifer Barber, Sociology Professor, Indiana University; and Dr.
John Santelli, Professor, Heilbrunn Department of Population and Family Health and Pediatrics at Columbia
University. The proposed K01 project will place Dr. Greenleaf in a unique and important position to conduct truly
innovative studies of contraceptive and HIV-prevention behavior among adolescent girls and young women in
Sub-Saharan Africa, a priority population for reaching global sexual and reproductive health improvements."
10756156,"Slightly over 1 in 5 children in the United States are growing up in a household that speaks a language other
than English. For these children, developing bilingual skills will allow them to communicate both with family
members who have limited English skills and with English-speaking teachers and peers. However, for children
with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), there is limited research about how to facilitate their bilingual
development. Professionals and parents have often assumed that learning two languages would be too
challenging, especially for children with minimal spoken language skills. While several studies over the past
decade have demonstrated that bilingual exposure is not detrimental for language development in children with
ASD, these studies have focused mostly on the acquisition of English rather than examining factors that
promote development of both languages. Furthermore, bilingual studies have generally excluded children with
minimal/low verbal skills. The proposed sequential mixed-methods project places a new emphasis on
variability within the bilingual experiences of children with ASD and their families. It seeks to identify factors
associated with children’s skills in both languages, as well as their social-cognitive skills such as perspective-
taking and cognitive flexibility. The quantitative phase will include 60 Spanish-speaking families with children
with ASD (ages 4-6), including children who are minimally verbal. The first aim is to characterize sources of
variation in the types of bilingual language environments experienced by children with ASD (e.g., different
languages from caregivers vs. therapists; different languages from different caregivers; code-switching by
bilingual caregivers; changes in language choices over time). The second aim is to examine predictors of
children’s dual-language communication and social-cognitive skills, including the role of quantity and contexts
of Spanish exposure. In a qualitative phase conducted with a subset of 30 families, the third aim is to interpret
the quantitative findings in reference to family perspectives, priorities, experiences, and challenges with
language choices and support services. The long-term goal of this work is to collaborate with families and
service providers to develop interventions that support bilingual families and promote the linguistic and social-
cognitive development of children across the autism spectrum. This career development proposal includes an
expert team of mentors from Psychology, Communication Disorders, and Public Health. The training goals
focus on conducting research with minimally verbal children with ASD, mixed methods, and using community-
based participatory research to develop and evaluate interventions. The research aims and training goals of
this career development award reflect current priorities in the strategic plan of the NIDCD for Voice, Speech,
and Language, including Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention in Understudied Populations
(Priority Area 3) and Improving Outcomes for Human Communication through community-based research
(Priority Area 4)."
10591083,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This collaborative grant application proposes (a) to conduct a multicenter single-arm pivotal clinical trial of the Jarvik 2015
left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as a bridge-to-transplant in 22 hospitalized children with severe heart failure (HF)
refractory to medical therapy; and (b) to generate the safety and effectiveness data necessary to support regulatory
review and potential FDA approval of the Jarvik 2015 LVAD under the Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) pathway.
The HDE pathway is FDA’s approval process for high-risk medical devices intended to treat rare and/or orphan diseases.
The need for safe, reliable, and dischargeable LVADs for smaller children with HF is well-established. Currently, the Berlin
Heart EXCOR Pediatric VAD is the only FDA-approved durable VAD for smaller children. While outcomes have improved,
the Berlin Heart has important limitations: (1) patients cannot be discharged on VAD support; (2) the paracorporeal design,
with large-bore cannulae traversing the abdominal wall results in a high incidence of wound complications; and (3) the
high pump thrombogenicity (especially around the valves) requires intravenous anticoagulants and intermittent pump
exchanges to preempt the risk of stroke. There is an enormous technology gap between contemporary adult VADs
(continuous flow [CF], magnetically-levitated, and safely dischargeable) and contemporary pediatric VADs (pulsatile,
pneumatically driven, non-dischargeable). In recent years, the Jarvik 2015 LVAD, a fully implantable CF device has emerged
as an alternative to the Berlin Heart. Data from the FDA’s Early Feasibility Study (EFS) suggest the Jarvik 2015 LVAD can
support smaller children successfully for up to a year or longer as a bridge to transplant. However, systematic data in a
22-subject Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) pivotal trial is required for FDA review and approval. The safety endpoint
is freedom from device-related stroke. The effectiveness endpoint is survival to transplant or 180 days in the absence of
severe stroke. The IDE received conditional FDA approval on June 4, 2021 (IDE# G160185).
The trial will be conducted at 14 centers in the US and Europe with a Clinical Coordinating Center at Stanford University
and a Data Coordinating Center at HealthCore, Inc. The investigator group has a strong history of collaborative research
and multicenter clinical trials, facilitating smooth execution of the proposed study. In accordance with FDA’s requirements
for approval of humanitarian devices, a pre-specified performance goal will demonstrate safety and effectiveness (≥17 of
22 subjects free of stroke, and ≥17subjects surviving to transplant or 180 days free of severe stroke: with central review
of clinical events and neuroimaging studies).
While safe, reliable, and dischargeable LVADs are widely available for adults, pediatric VAD technology lags behind by
multiple generations of technology. Moreover, children who safely survive their VAD course have a substantially longer
potential life expectancy making evaluation of newer pediatric VADs an urgent priority for the heart failure community.
This trial has the potential to take a crucial step in achieving that goal."

Interoception refers to the representation of the internal states of an organism, and includes the processes by
which it senses, interprets, integrates, and regulates signals from within itself. Interoception is increasingly
viewed as a bidirectional process between the brain and body, in which multiple feedback and feedforward
loops lead to an internal representation of the body. The vagus nerve is intimately involved in autonomic
control of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, with afferent projections to medullary brainstem nuclei. In turn,
interoceptive pathways can also be directly targeted for clinically beneficial neuromodulation and non-invasive
neuromodulatory techniques that interact with brainstem vagal circuitry, including transcutaneous auricular
vagal nerve stimulation (taVNS), have been reported to modulate efferent visceral vagal pathways via the
engagement of nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS). However, broader understanding of taVNS effects on gastric
function and brain response to gastric interoceptive signaling is needed, and requires tools to directly probe the
gut-brain axis in humans. In our study, we will combine a fully non-invasive experimental framework including
sequential gastric and brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with calibrated meal ingestion and MRI-
compatible taVNS to evaluate the modulation of visceral interoception along the brain-gut axis. Aim 1 will
evaluate gastric function and brain response to gastric interoceptive signaling following calibrated meal
ingestion. In Aim 2, we will then investigate taVNS modulation of gastric function and brain response to gastric
interoceptive signaling. The proposed study will contribute new insights into the bidirectional gut-brain
interaction underlying gastric interoception, and its modulation via non-invasive neuromodulatory techniques
that specifically target interoceptive pathways (i.e. taVNS)."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is caused by insulin resistance in peripheral tissues and pancreatic beta-cell
dysfunction. Insulin resistance precedes beta-cell failure, and the beta-cell’s inability to keep up with the
increased demand of insulin production and secretion leads to glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia. The
human C2CD4B-C2CD4A-VPS13C locus harbors a pancreatic beta-cell super-enhancer, and is heavily
decorated by T2D risk-associated GWAS SNPs from virtually every ethnic group studied to date. There are
only ~20 publications on “C2cd4a” in PubMed, the majority of which are association studies linking this
locus to human diabetes susceptibility. Through a multi-omics approach followed by functional analysis in
mice, we found that beta cell-specific C2cd4a ablation impairs insulin secretion. In this proposal, through
C2cd4a we provide a basis to link exercise-induced hypoglycemia and type 2 diabetes treatment. We will
investigate C2cd4a-regulated beta cell function, and build a pathway centered on C2cd4a. Two Aims are
envisioned: in Aim 1, we will map the repressor domain using truncated versions of human and mouse
C2CD4A, and investigate the mechanism of exercise-induced hypoglycemia in beta cell-specific C2cd4a
knockout mice. In Aim 2, we will solidify C2cd4a’s role in the nucleus as a transcription cofactor, acting on
promoters and enhancers of key beta cell genes. We will examine the regulation of C2cd4a by a novel
intergenic long noncoding RNA. These Aims will advance our understanding of C2cd4a as a human diabetes
susceptibility gene, and provide a blueprint to leverage human genetics data into biological insight that will
eventually benefit patients."

Cognitive maps refer to internal representations of spatial and non-spatial relationships between
entities (people or things) or events in the external world. There has been widespread
excitement generated by recent discoveries that even continuous non-spatial task dimensions
may be organized and ‘navigated’ as a cognitive map. These studies suggest the neural
representations and computations revealed in physical space may be only one instance of a
general mechanism for organizing and “navigating” any behaviorally-relevant continuous task
dimensions (e.g. space, time, sound frequency, metric length). This insight raises the intriguing
possibility that the well-established coding principles revealed during spatial navigation can also
be used to understand flexible decision making in abstract and discrete tasks that are
commonplace in the real world when they are based on a cognitive map, such as whom to
collaborate with or where to eat.
 A cognitive map of an environment or task is incredibly powerful because it enables
inferences to be made from limited experiences that can dramatically accelerate new learning
and even guide novel decisions never faced before. Moreover, similar tasks that share an
overall structure can be directly related to one another, thereby facilitating rapid generalization
from one task or entity to another. Despite this wide-ranging importance for flexible cognition,
we have only a basic understanding of how cognitive maps enable such novel inferences and
generalization. Better understanding the mechanisms involved also carry significant clinical
implications. Indeed, abnormal inferences, cognitive flexibility, and generalization are thought to
core dysfunctions in several psychiatric conditions, ranging from schizophrenia to obsessive
compulsive disorder to certain expressions of mood disorder. It follows that developing a
mechanistic model of these component processes in humans has the potential to inform
principled investigations into biomarkers and treatment targets for these disorders.
 The goal of this proposal is to develop a new neural model of how cognitive maps of
abstract and discrete tasks are represented neurally and used to guide novel inferences during
decision making in the human brain. We have developed a new experimental paradigm that
induces people to form abstract and discrete cognitive maps (e.g. of social networks) and
perform novel inferences during decision making. To develop our model, we will combine
computational models of learning and inference in this paradigm with geometric models of
neural coding derived from spatial navigation and “representational” and computational
functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis methods that allow inferences to be made
about the information represented and computations performed in different brain structures,
respectively. The insights gained from this research will lead to substantial theoretical advances
in models of goal-directed decision making, cognitive flexibility, and memory, with implications
for typical and atypical individuals."
10794365,"Selpercatinib (LOXO-292) is a highly active selective RET inhibitor explored on an ongoing registrational
program (LIBRETTO-001 phase 1/2 trial) in RET-dependent cancers (US FDA approval in 2020 for RET
fusion-positive lung/thyroid cancer and RET-mutant thyroid cancer). Unfortunately, resistance is
uncharacterized and remains a liability. This proposal anticipates and addresses this unmet need by identifying
and functionally characterizing mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired genomic and non-genomic resistance to
selective RET inhibition in RET-dependent cancers. To accomplish this, we will leverage unique clinical,
computational, and translational resources at our disposal. Aim 1 will identify determinants of intrinsic
resistance to RET inhibition in RET-dependent cancers. Pre-treatment biopsies of selpercatinib responders
and non-responders will undergo targeted/whole exome sequencing. Computational analysis will explore the
role of clonality, allelic imbalance, and co-mutational signatures relative to selpercatinib response and
progression-free survival. Aim 2 will establish the mechanisms of acquired resistance to selective RET
inhibition. Paired pre-treatment and post-progression tumor biopsies and longitudinal cell-free (cf)DNA
(baseline, on-treatment, at/post- progression) from LIBRETTO-001 patients will be profiled. Utilizing paired
samples will allow for the identification of emergent genomic and non-genomic (including histologic/EMT
transformation) resistance mechanisms. In addition, plasma profiling will allow for a dynamic assessment of
selpercatinib resistance that captures the consequences of serial genomic evolution. Aim 3 will functionally
characterize resistance to selective RET inhibition. A unique and rich library of patient-derived models of
treatment-naïve and RET inhibitor resistant RET-dependent cancers will be augmented by ongoing prospective
collection and model development from LIBRETTO-001 and commercial use. In these models, on-target
(secondary RET mutations) and off-target (MET/PI3K/KRAS/MDM2 activation) resistance mechanisms will be
functionally characterized in terms of cell/tumor viability, receptor tyrosine kinase activation, and downstream
signaling dependencies. Novel therapeutic strategies, specifically RET tyrosine kinase inhibitor type switching
(on-target resistance) and combinatorial therapies (off-target resistance), will be explored in vitro and in vivo.
Optimal combination therapies will then be employed in compassionate use programs to confirm their
effectiveness and provide tailored, life-saving treatment to patients. In addition, patients with on-target
resistance will be treated on-protocol (Drilon PI) with the next-generation RET inhibitor, TPX-0046. This
proposal has both immediate and long-term relevance considering that about 400 patients have been treated
with selpercatinib around the world on trial and the potential approval and rapid adoption of this drug by
multiple regulatory agencies. These current and future patients are in dire need of strategies to re-establish
durable disease control after progression on selective RET inhibition."

American Heart Association estimates a 2.5% prevalence of valvular heart disease in the US, requiring over
100,000 valve replacements annually. Current replacement heart valves are far from ideal, leading the NHLBI
cardiac surgery working group to recommend increased support for heart valve biomaterial research. Although
glutaraldehyde fixed xenogeneic tissue valves (e.g., bovine pericardium (BP)) improve short-term survival,
chronic graft-specific immune responses persist, resulting in long-term biomaterial damage, calcification and
ultimately failure (~2-10 yr depending on age at implantation). Indeed, NHLBI xenotransplantation working group
noted that biomaterial antigenicity represents the primary translational barrier to expanding the use of xenogeneic
tissues in clinical practice. Unfixed BP in which human-relevant antigens are eliminated has potential to serve as
an immunologically-acceptable extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold for heart valve bioprostheses. However,
identifying human-relevant BP antigens and facilitating their removal from candidate ECM scaffolds represent
critical translational barriers for development of such biomaterials. We hypothesize that elimination of human-
relevant antigens can be achieved by employing targeted antigen solubilization steps during BP ECM scaffold
production. This proposal seeks to define primary BP antigens responsible for initiating graft-specific immune
responses in human patients (Aim 1, Phase 1), quantify removal (Aim 1, Phase 2) and target elimination of such
human-relevant antigens from BP ECM scaffolds (Aim 1, Phase 3). Unfixed ECM scaffolds that avoid destructive
graft-specific adaptive immune responses have potential to modulate constructive pro-regenerative recipient
innate immune responses. Our group has previously demonstrated that retention of native tissue ECM niche in
BP scaffolds is critical to promoting pro-regenerative in vivo recipient responses. However, extent to which
exposure of natural matricryptic sites can further enhance pro-regenerative innate immune polarization towards
intact BP ECM scaffolds remains unknown. We hypothesize that ECM niche and matricryptic signal exposure are
critical factors in modulating human macrophage polarization and ultimate in vivo scaffold fate. This proposal
aims to determine mechanisms (i.e., ECM niche component and macrophage receptor) by which differing
sources of matricryptic signal exposure modulate human macrophage polarization (Aim 2, Phase 1) and combine
optimal levels of each matricryptic exposure source toward maximizing pro-regenerative polarization (Aim 2,
Phase 2). Aim 1 and 2 factors identified as having potential to positively modulate in vivo scaffold fate in humans
will be validated using an in vivo ovine heart valve replacement model (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will
provide mechanistic insights into human-relevant antigens responsible for initiating graft-specific immune
response towards current clinically-utilized xenogeneic biomaterials, define mechanisms by which matricryptic
signaling modulates human macrophage polarization and leverage these findings towards development of next
generation immunologically-acceptable pro-regenerative unfixed BP ECM scaffolds for heart valve replacements."
10814184,"PROJECT SUMMARY
ERBB2/HER2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is amplified/overexpressed in 15-20% of breast and
gastroesophageal cancers, for which anti-HER2 therapy is now standard of care. HER2 can be hyperactivated
by overexpression and by mutations driving oncogenesis through receptor phosphorylation, internalization, and
increased turnover. Hyperactivating HER2 mutations, possessed by thousands of patients with non-breast/non-
gastric solid tumors, do not respond to classical anti-HER2 kinase therapy. Anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugates
(ADCs) offer a new treatment avenue for non-breast/non-gastric HER2-altered tumors. ADCs bind to HER2 on
the cell surface, get internalized, and release their cytotoxic payloads in the endolysosomes to induce cell death.
Two “basket” trials at our institution testing the antitumor activity of the anti-HER2 ADCs,
trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in n
found clinical responses in lung, colorectal, salivary duct, biliary tract, ovarian, and endometrial cancers.
Moreover, we showed that HER2 mutant lung tumors are responsive to T-DM1 regardless of HER2 protein
levels. Here, we plan to use several cell line-based and patient-derived preclinical models (organoids,
xenografts) bearing different HER2 protein levels, mutations, and activation/phosphorylation statuses to study
how the variation in receptor expression/phosphorylation modulates endocytosis and anti-HER2 ADC activity.
We show that irreversible pan-HER inhibitors, such as neratinib, enhance ubiquitination, internalization, and
consequent degradation of HER2. Neratinib also increases HER2-ADC complex internalization in vitro, leading
to complete tumor regression in patient-derived xenograft models (lung and colon cancer) bearing amplification
or mutations of ERBB2. We plan to identify determinants of sensitivity to DM1 or DXd payloads by integrating
genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data acquired from sensitive and resistant models. Finally, we will use
these data to prioritize biomarkers of response to T-DM1 and T-DXd identified by genomic and proteomic
analysis of the tumor samples, and imaging tumors bearing different HER2 alterations from the 124 patients
enrolled in our basket trials. Tumor biopsies and cell-free DNA samples collected before and during treatment,
and at disease progression will be analyzed by targeted exome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, and
droplet digital PCR. These data will characterize changes in ERBB2 status during treatment and whether other
genomic alterations modulate response to therapy during tumor evolution. FRET and other imaging-based
techniques will quantify the level of HER2 dimerization with other RTKs. Tumor biopsies, analyzed by global and
targeted mass spectrometry, will identify a specific proteomic signature of response to the ADCs. Clinical
on-breast/non-gastric solid tumors,
response to ADCs will also be correlated with HER2 levels by
89Zr-trastuzumab PET/CT. Our studies will provide
fundamental insights into the mechanism of action of anti-HER2 ADCs and will open new therapeutic horizons
for patients without effective, targeted therapy options."
10830396,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
As key modifiers of injury outcome following CNS insults, reactive astrocytes represent a rational cellular target
for neural repair. CNS injury results in scar-forming astrogliosis at the primary lesion and diffuse astrogliosis in
areas of distal axon degeneration, the latter of which is poorly characterized. Without a complete understanding
of how reactive astrocyte subtypes impact the CNS injury response, harnessing the full therapeutic potentials of
reactive astrocytes will remain unlikely. The long-term goal is to translate knowledge of the diverse functions of
reactive astrocytes to treat CNS trauma. Towards this goal, the objective of this proposal is to identify the
molecular and cellular mechanisms that determine location-specific functions of scar-forming and diffuse
astrogliosis in the injured spinal cord. The hypothesis is that scar-forming astrogliosis supports pathological
macrophage retention within the chronic scar at the lesion, whereas diffuse astrogliosis induces axon growth
distal to the lesion after spinal cord injury (SCI). The rationale for this proposal is that defining the cell-intrinsic
and environmental contributions to the diverse functions of reactive astrocytes will inform on how to target
reactive astrocytes efficaciously for CNS repair. Based on strong supporting data, this hypothesis will be tested
by pursuing three specific aims: 1) determine the role of scar-forming astrocytes in macrophage maintenance at
the chronic SCI scar; 2) examine the role of diffuse astrogliosis in promoting axon growth distal to the lesion; and
3) assess the effects of locally modifying either scar-forming or diffuse astrogliosis by an AAV-mediated approach
on SCI recovery. These studies will significantly advance understanding of reactive astrocytes and the ability to
develop novel astrocyte-targeted therapeutic approaches to attenuate chronic scarring and promote axon growth
after SCI."

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression. Peripheral nerve injury dysregulated their
expression in the pain-related regions including dorsal root ganglion (DRG). However, the role of most
identified lncRNAs in neuropathic pain is still uncertain. Identifying novel lncRNAs and exploring their
contribution to neuropathic pain may provide novel strategies for management of this disorder. We recently
used a next generation RNA sequencing approach and identified a large, native, full-length non-coding RNA in
mice and human. Because it is expressed highly in the DRG, we named it as DRG specific long noncoding
RNA (DS-lncRNA). Our preliminary data revealed that peripheral nerve injury downregulated DS-lncRNA likely
due to a decrease in the expression of a transcriptional activator Pou4f3 in the injured DRG. Rescuing this
downregulation attenuated the nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivity, likely through blockade of the
increased interaction between RALY (a transcription co-factor) and the RNA polymerase II (RNA II) and
consequent silence of the RALY/RNA II-triggered expression of Ehmt2 mRNA and its coding protein G9a (a
key player in neuropathic pain) in the injured DRG. Given that DS-lncRNA can directly bind to RALY, our
preliminary results indicate that DRG DS-lncRNA downregulation is required for neuropathic pain likely
through negative regulation of DRG RALY/RNA II-triggered G9a expression. This proposal will further
examine whether and how DS-lncRNA contributes to neuropathic pain. In Specific Aim 1, we will first
investigate whether rescuing downregulation of DS-lncRNA in the injured DRG attenuates neuropathic pain
development and maintenance. We will then examine whether mimicking nerve injury-induced downregulation
of DRG DS-lncRNA leads to neuropathic pain symptoms in the absence of nerve injury. In Specific Aim 2, we
will examine whether peripheral nerve injury results in time-dependent downregulation of DS-lncRNA and its
transcription factor Pou4f3 in the DRG. We will also examine whether DS-lncRNA downregulation is attributed
to a decrease of Pou4f3 expression in the injured DRG after peripheral nerve injury. In Specific Aim 3, we will
test the effect of DS-lncRNA on the expression of Ehmt2 mRNA, G9a and their downstream pain-related
genes in the injured DRG after peripheral nerve injury. We will also determine whether DS-lncRNA
downregulation enhances the binding of RALY to RNA II leading to RALY/RNA II-triggered Ehmt2/G9a
increase and G9a-controlled pain-related gene decrease in the injured DRG after peripheral nerve injury. Our
study will likely identify a previously unknown regulatory mechanism for neuropathic pain. Given that virus-
mediated gene therapy has been used in clinical trial, the present study will have a potential clinical
application in neuropathic pain management."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major public health problem affecting over 5 million people in the US. Patients
with AD have beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau pathology and typically present with memory loss. However,
approximately 25% of AD subjects do not present with early memory loss and instead present with other
cognitive complaints, and are referred to as atypical AD. The most common atypical AD syndromes include
logopenic aphasia (LPA), a syndrome affecting language syndrome, and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), a
syndrome affecting visuospatial/perceptual skills. In the 1st cycle of this R01 we used positron emission
tomography (PET) to assess Aβ and tau deposition across atypical and typical variants of AD, and we found a
large degree of heterogeneity both cross-sectionally and longitudinally that was associated with syndrome and
age. The goal of the 2nd cycle of the R01 is to investigate the degree to which other biological mechanisms are
related to the heterogeneity we observed in tau and Aβ. In aim 1, we will assess how both functional
connectivity, measured using resting state fMRI, and iron deposition, measured using quantitative
susceptibility mapping, are related to cross-sectional and longitudinal heterogeneity in tau and Aβ in AD. In aim
2, we will assess how genetic risk factors are related to heterogeneity in tau and Aβ. We will assess the
relationship between apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4 and tau and Aβ, and we will also perform a whole genome
sequencing analysis to identify genetic variants associated with heterogeneity in tau and Aβ in AD. In aim 3,
we will model the system of genetic and multi-modal imaging mechanisms in order to determine inter-
relationships and independent contributions of each of our disease mechanisms to the heterogeneity of tau
and Aβ. We plan to recruit a cohort of 100 subjects (33 LPA, 33 PCA, 34 typical AD) into the 2nd cycle of the
R01. Each subject will undergo two serial assessments 12 months apart that will include neurological and
neuropsychological testing, 3T MRI that includes resting state fMRI and quantitative susceptibility mapping, Aβ
PET using Pittsburgh Compound B and tau-PET using [18F]flortaucipir. All subjects will also undergo a blood
draw for genetic analysis. These 100 subjects will be used to address aims 1 and 3. For aim 2, we will utilize
the 100 subjects from the 2nd cycle plus the 70 subjects recruited into the 1st cycle that underwent Aβ and tau
PET and provided a blood sample (total=170 subjects), and we will replicate our whole genome sequencing
analyses in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our R01 will have a major impact on public health
since atypical AD effects ~1,000,000 Americans. Our research will increase understanding of biological
mechanisms underlying phenotypical and age differences in AD and mechanisms that may determine routes of
protein spread through the brain. This knowledge will be useful to aid in the future development of
mechanistically based treatments and interventions for AD."
10793565,"Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) and its most metastatic subtype, metaplastic carcinoma (mBrCA) occur with higher frequency in African American (AA) women than Whites and have 5-year overall survival of 73% and 54%, respectively. We have recently reported their proteomic landscape using clinical samples, but the molecular mechanisms driving metastasis are still unclear. We have shown that EZH2 overexpression in breast carcinomas is associated with TNBC and mBrCA subtype, and that EZH2 is an independent biomarker of poor patient survival. While the oncogenic role of EZH2 in breast and other malignancies has been established, the mechanisms of EZH2 metastatic function are far from understood. This application will elucidate a novel mechanism driving breast cancer metastasis, a critical unmet need. EZH2 is the histone H3 lysine 27 methyltransferase of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), responsible for epigenetic silencing. However, studies show that a subset of aggressive TNBC express high EZH2 and low H3K27me3, suggesting that in these tumors EZH2 may function via H3K27me3-independent mechanism(s). A major breakthrough in our lab during the previous cycle has been the discovery that phosphorylation of EZH2 at threonine 367 (T367) by p38 MAP Kinase leads to EZH2 cytoplasmic localization and is crucial for metastasis. In clinical samples, cytoplasmic pEZH2 T367 is significantly associated with TNBC and mBrCA phenotypes compared to other breast cancer subtypes, highlighting the translational significance of our proposal. Since the initial submission, we have discovered that cytoplasmic pEZH2 T367 directly methylates p38α protein, increasing p-p38 pathway activity on pro-migratory proteins such as Vinculin. However, the mechanism(s) and functional consequences need investigation. Our OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS is that cytoplasmic pEZH2 T367 is critical for breast cancer metastasis through direct methylation of p38α and activation of p38α cytoplasmic pro-invasive and pro-metastatic targets. We further hypothesize that detection of pEZH2 T367, p-p38, p-Vinculin, and H3K27me3 proteins may serve as specific biomarkers with prognostic and diagnostic utility in clinical tissue samples. We propose three independent aims: AIM 1. To develop inducible, mammary-specific wild-type and EZH2 phospho-mutant transgenic mice and assess their proteomic landscape and metastatic potential. AIM 2. To elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) by which pEZH2 T367 promotes progression and metastasis. AIM 3. To test the potential for pEZH2-T367 and pathway proteins as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers in human breast tissue samples of African, AA, and Whites. We have characterized cohorts of human breast cancer tissues (n>4,000, including 200 from Ghanaian, and 275 cases of mBrCAs of all races) with >15 years of follow-up. The reagents and expertise are in place in the PI and co-Investigators’ laboratories. Our innovative studies are expected to provide new diagnostic and prognostic markers for metastatic TNBC and mBrCA, which are currently nonexistent."

Although the most significant risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is advanced age, the changes
in tissue microstructure that signal the shift from normal aging to AD are not well understood. Thus, in response
to PAR-22-093, NOT-AG-21-039: Understanding AD in the Context of the Aging Brain, we seek to elucidate the
changes in white matter microstructure in preclinical AD using advanced diffusion MRI methods developed by
our group. During the 1st funding period of this grant, we established a longitudinal cohort of 165 cognitively
unimpaired participants ages 45-85 who completed extensive clinical procedures (i.e. MRI, amyloid PET,
neuropsychological testing, questionnaires), with an exceptional 92% retention rate at 2-year follow-up, including
14% of participants who have developed incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) thus far. We showed that in
participants with preclinical AD, late-myelinating white matter tracts demonstrate signs of myelin repair/gliosis as
evidenced by greater diffusion restriction. We also observed that greater diffusion restriction in the hippocampus
significantly predicts incident MCI over and above age, a finding we did not observe with other AD neuroimaging
biomarkers of amyloid pathology, neurodegeneration, and white matter lesions. These results have significant
implications for disease monitoring and treatment development for the very earliest stages of AD, but further
work is needed to refine these methods and determine how they indicate both aging and disease progression
over time. Thus, during the 2nd funding period, we seek to continue studying this cohort longitudinally every 2
years, to enhance the cohort’s inclusivity and sample size, and to add new, complementary MRI biomarkers of
myelin/gliosis to test our inferences. Our overall objective is to delineate the natural history of white matter
changes from normal aging to preclinical AD and to MCI/dementia, illuminating what aspects of myelin/gliosis
drive changes in diffusivity, where these preferentially occur, and when in the course of disease these take place.
We will continue leveraging our interdisciplinary group’s expertise in diffusion MRI (Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging,
Fiber Ball Imaging) and biophysical modeling, adding new experts on T1-based myelin water imaging and 1H-
Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy to assay myelin dynamics/gliosis. We hypothesize that advanced diffusion
MRI methods can indicate myelin repair/gliosis in the preclinical stage prior to myelin breakdown and axonal loss
in the symptomatic stage, a trajectory that is distinct from normal, homeostatic processes such as myelin
remodeling/maintenance. Thus, we aim to: Characterize longitudinal changes in white matter microstructure in
aging and AD (Aim 1); Quantify microscopic axonal fiber organization in aging and AD (Aim 2); Determine the
associations between diffusion MRI-derived microstructural parameters and complementary measures of
myelin/gliosis in aging and AD (Aim 3). This work will have the greatest overall impact in providing the critical
translational support for trials that target mechanisms such as innate immunity/inflammation and glial
senescence, which are very promising yet grossly underexplored in AD especially for the asymptomatic stage."
10894603,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Emerging infectious diseases pose a significant threat to human and agricultural health; therefore, it is imperative
that we take a proactive approach toward understanding virus and host factors that are associated with infection
and pathogenesis. Many bunyavirus infections, including Rift Valley fever (RVFV), Cache Valley (CVV), and
Schmallenberg (SBV) viruses, cause massive abortogenic events in livestock that lead to significant economic
strain and increased susceptibility of human infection. La Crosse virus (LCV), a related bunyavirus, is not known
to cause vertical transmission in livestock, however vertical transmission has been implicated upon experimental
infection. Two cases of vertical transmission of RVFV have occurred in pregnant women and those infected with
RVFV have a higher risk for late-term miscarriages. Whether vertical transmission occurs in ruminants and
humans due to LACV infection or in humans from SBV and CVV infection is unknown. Given LACV and
CVV infections can cause life-threatening diseases in humans, it is plausible that congenital infection may simply
be overlooked due to the mild nature of most bunyavirus infections. We hypothesize that SBV, CVV, and LACV
can infect human and ruminant placentas and that virulence factors, such as NSm, and variable induction of
antiviral responses across viruses dictate pathogenesis severity, and thus teratogenicity, across host species.
This proposal will utilize two model systems to study bunyavirus infection of the placenta. First, we will
examine whether LACV, CVV, SBV, and RVFV infect placenta explants from humans, sheep, and rats in vitro.
Using wild type and NSm knockout viruses, we will identify whether NSm contributes to host or cellular tropism,
immune responses to infection, programmed cell death pathways, and congenital pathogenesis. Second, we
will utilize genetically tractable 2D human trophoblast and trophoblast organoid (TO) systems to compare cell-
specific differences in immune responses and cell death pathways upon bunyavirus infection. This will be the
first study to utilize human placenta organoids to study congenital bunyavirus infection. To successfully complete
the proposed project, I have developed an exceptional career development plan under the primary mentorship
of Dr. Amy Hartman (University of Pittsburgh (U Pitt)) and co-mentors, Drs. Carolyn Coyne (Duke University)
and Leonard D’Aiuto (U Pitt). My training will consist of hands-on and didactic training in human organoid
development in addition to didactic training in pathology, cross-species placenta biology, and immunology. U Pitt
provides the necessary environment to support the proposed research and training through accessibility to
outstanding scientists, high containment laboratory and animal facilities, training opportunities in laboratory
management, responsible conduct of research and grantsmanship, and opportunities to present research.
Successful training and completion of the proposed research will support my ultimate career goal to establish an
independent research program studying the cross virus- and host-species mechanisms of bunyavirus congenital
infections with a special niche in human and ruminant placenta organoid research and congenital pathology."

Cystinuria is an inherited human kidney disease with significant morbidity affecting 1 in 7000, including veterans.
The disease is caused by mutation of genes involved in renal cystine transport resulting in elevated urinary
cystine with kidney stone formation. With the genetic basis of the disorder defined (mutation in SLC3A1,
cystinuria type A), opportunities for targeted molecular therapies exist. Building upon our previous grant, we
propose an innovative experimental design to demonstrate long-term phenotypic correction of cystinuria in an
intact animal using a combination of transposon and adeno-associated virus (AAV) technologies.
In specific aim 1, we will test the ability of hybrid AAV-piggyBac transposon technology to mediate long-term
transgene expression in mouse kidney and correct cystinuria in a Slc3a1-/- mouse model. In specific aim 2, we
will test the ability of novel proximal tubule targeted AAV to deliver transgenes to proximal tubule cells in mice in
vivo. In both aims, we will test delivery to and evaluate for long-term transgene expression in both neonatal and
adult mice. In specific aim 3, we propose to bridge our foundational pre-clinical studies to human application by
testing AAV delivery to human kidney organoids including cystinuria organoids. Our innovative but feasible
studies will expand use of AAV and transposon technology for kidney gene delivery and lay a pre-clinical
foundation for ultimate human therapeutic application for kidney disease in veterans and others."
10829879,"Project Summary
Thrombopoietin (TPO), a plasma glycoprotein made in hepatocytes, binds to its cell surface receptor MPL
expressed on megakaryocytes and megakaryocyte progenitors, promoting cell proliferation and maturation. In
addition to its role in megakaryocyte development and platelet production, TPO also plays a critical role in
hematopoietic stem cell survival and maintenance. In humans, gain-of-function mutations in TPO result in
autosomal dominant thrombocytosis (high platelet counts), while loss-of-function mutations in TPO (or in its
receptor MPL) result in congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, a disease characterized by low platelet
counts and absence of bone marrow megakaryocytes at birth with subsequent bone marrow aplasia and
failure. The transcriptional regulation and plasma clearance of TPO have been well studied. In contrast, the
mechanism by which TPO is secreted from hepatocytes and by which TPO is degraded intracellularly remain
unknown. We have shown in preliminary results that mice deficient in LMAN1 exhibit thrombocytopenia and
that the thrombocytopenia is recapitulated in mice with hepatocyte-specific LMAN1 deletion but not in mice
with hematopoietic-specific LMAN1 deletion. We have additionally shown that the plasma TPO level is low in
LMAN1 deficient mice (~50% of normal). Taken together with LMAN1’s known function as an endoplasmic
reticulum cargo receptor, these results strongly suggest that the thrombocytopenia observed in LMAN1
deficient mice is due to impaired secretion of TPO from hepatocytes. Consistent with these findings in mice, we
have shown that LMAN1 deficiency results in intracellular accumulation of TPO in human cells. Therefore, the
role of LMAN1 in regulating TPO appears to be conserved in mice and humans. In this proposal, we aim to
define the role of LMAN1 in regulating the plasma TPO levels in mice and to dissect the mechanism by which
LMAN1 regulates TPO secretion, both under a normal physiological state and in the setting of enhanced TPO
production. In additional preliminary results, we have performed an unbiased genome-scale CRISPR knock-out
screen to identify novel regulators of the intracellular TPO level. This screen, performed in biological triplicates,
followed by validation experiments, demonstrated that deletion of UBE3C results in intracellular accumulation
of TPO but no intracellular accumulation of any of the 3 control secretory proteins tested. UBE3C is an E3
ubiquitin ligase, suggesting that TPO is a substrate for UBE3C and that in the absence of UBE3C, TPO
ubiquitination is impaired, resulting in reduced degradation. Therefore, an additional aim of this proposal is to
define the role of UBE3C in regulating the intracellular TPO level, both under steady state TPO production and
in a state of high TPO production. This proposal has important implications for understanding the mechanisms
of TPO regulation at the level of its intracellular trafficking/secretion and at the level of its intracellular
degradation. Knowledge gained from this proposal may lay the foundation for the development of novel
strategies to therapeutically regulate the plasma TPO level."
10792591,"The overarching aim of our proposed training program is to provide an integrated experience and pathway for
underrepresented undergraduate students who aspire to become independent biomedical researchers. U-
RISE at PSU will recruit, train, and mentor students from underrepresented groups, using evidence-based
approaches and institutionalizing sustainable programmatic practices. The U-RISE at PSU approach reflects
the following principles: 1) Curriculum must center on inquiry-based learning that fosters scientific thinking and
investigation. 2) Students need authentic long-term experiences contributing to actual research projects and
opportunities to expand and deepen their contributions to research projects over time. 3) Belonging to inclusive
communities, such as peer cohorts and research teams, provides students with a sense of support and identity
as researchers. 4) A team of mentors ensures students have support and guidance in multiple domains
spanning personal, educational, and career development throughout their undergraduate training experience.
5) Students should have opportunities to conceive, propose, conduct, and report on their research with
supportive advising. 6) Students must have a supportive environment addressing their holistic needs for
personal, financial, cultural, social, and educational support. The overall training plan is a comprehensive,
multi-level intervention program that will scaffold several stages of training. The first two stages, Orientation
and Preparation, are designed to recruit a broad group of diverse students who have expressed an interest in
biomedical research, build a supportive peer cohort, and plan for education and career opportunities in
biomedical research. After completing this preparation phase, students apply to become U-RISE trainees,
where they are matched with a Research Learning Community (RLC) and engage in a hands-on long-term
research training experience. The placement phase begins with their first summer research activity, Summer
Induction, provides a guided entry into their RLC. During the Integration stage, U-RISE trainees practice
team science with their RLC team and conduct their own research project during their summer research
Immersion experience. For the culmination phase, RISE trainees continue collaborating in their RLC and
complete the dissemination component of their research. The Culmination phase transitions U-RISE trainees
into a biomedical research-focused graduate program. Throughout U-RISE at PSU trainees will have access to
a multi-tiered mentoring program inclusive of peer mentors, a faculty/career mentor, and a research mentor.
Trainees are required to participate regularly in research enrichment workshops and complete training in
responsible conduct of research and rigor and reproducibility. The intended trainee outcomes include
developing self-efficacy and persistence as a scientist; planning to pursue a biomedical research career;
engaging in experiential learning; presenting at scientific conferences; publishing; graduating; and applying and
being admitted into a graduate program in a field leading to a biomedical research career."
10771280,"A multisystem disorder, Prader Willi syndrome (PWS) is genetically complex with loss of function of a 2-3 Mb
domain of paternally-expressed imprinted genes. The polycistronic SNURF-SNRPN-snoRNA locus encoding 2
proteins and 5 snoRNAs, including SNORD116 as one major gene, is important in determining phenotype.
Treatment in PWS uses early clinical and molecular diagnosis with behavioral modification, growth hormone,
or ongoing drug trials that affect hyperphagia or behavior, but are limited by an incomplete understanding of
pleiotropic phenotypes. Although these measures improve outcomes, none are a cure and significant clinical
morbidity persists. Potential approaches for epigenetic or genetic therapy to reactivate or replace silent or
missing PWS-genes are complicated by heterochromatic silencing and the many genes involved in disease.
This project will test an innovative approach involving miniaturization of PWS genetic elements into a single
therapeutic adeno-associated virus (AAV)-vector. The new AAV vector series will assess feasibility to replace
80% of PWS-genes, helping to determine how and which gene losses lead to cellular and biochemical
phenotypes in PWS. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that PWS-minigenes in an AAV-vector will appropriately
express PWS gene products in cells. The PWS-minigenes include SNURF-SNRPN in the endogenous
bicistronic layout with up to 5 snoRNAs, and the NDN-cistron, between AAV inverted terminal repeats. Use of
human gene sequences in rodent cells will distinguish expression of exogenous and endogenous loci.
Alternative vector structures will encode individual or clustered snoRNAs in SNURF-SNRPN introns or, to
mimic the endogenous organization, in 3’ introns. To reduce AAV vector size, and mimic endogenous
regulation, a synthetic NRF1-motif array mini-promoter having broad cell-specificity for expression will be used,
with all coding content of PWS-minigenes within AAV packaging capacity. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that
AAV-minigenes can rescue PWS cellular phenotypes. A PWS β-cell (INS-1) model shows a cell-autonomous
defect in insulin secretion and deficits in RNA and protein production of multiple hormones and ER
chaperones, which derive from loss of one or more of the Snurf-Snrpn-snoRNA genes. AAV-PWS minigene
vectors packaged as serotype AAV6 (optimal for rodent endocrine cells) will be transduced into control and
PWS β-cell lines (3 each), assessing correction in levels of insulin secretion, mRNA and protein levels of
peptide hormones (e.g., insulins, IAPP) and ER chaperones (e.g., HSPA5, HSP90B1). Aim 3 (in vivo
translation) tests the hypothesis that AAV-minigenes can rescue the pancreatic islet phenotypes and neonatal
lethality of a mouse model lacking expression of all PWS-genes. Therapeutic outcomes of AAV injections in
utero vs. postnatal day 1 will be compared. Miniaturization of genetic components in a single AAV vector
represents a remarkable opportunity for in vivo gene therapy of not only PWS but more broadly in disease."
10917057,"Immunotherapy has transformed the treatment landscape for a wide range of human malignancies. Immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are monoclonal antibodies that block the immune regulatory “checkpoint” receptors,
the Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Associated Protein 4 (CTLA-4), Programmed Cell Death 1 (PD-1), or its ligand PD-
L1. ICIs produce durable responses in many patients. However, coupled with their success, these treatments
commonly evoke a wide range of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
or thyroid disease, appearing to occur more frequently than originally expected. Immunotoxicity from cancer
immunotherapy occurs in up to 90%, whereas autoimmune endocrine diseases occur in approximately 50% of
patients treated with antibodies to CTLA-4 and/or PD-1/PD-L1. These irAEs can be serious or even life-
threatening, such as autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) presenting in DKA, and primary adrenal insufficiency
caused by autoimmune adrenalitis. A recent study showed a marked increase of ICI-related autoimmune
diabetes; reported in over 50% of the patients, with half of these patients presenting in DKA (50.2%). Thus,
reliable biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify the risk of irAEs in patients who are candidates for these
therapies (Aim I); these biomarkers may point to novel molecular pathways that could be targeted to prevent
irAEs caused by immune checkpoint blockade (Aim II). Specifically, we will utilize the state-of-the-art single-cell
platforms to investigate and characterize the comprehensive phenotypic and functional analyses of systemic
cellular networks in patients with ICI-induced endocrinopathies. Our studies are greatly facilitated by the Baylor
College of Medicine Immunotoxicity Working Group. Understanding the immunologic factors and the biomarkers
associated with ICI-mediated inflammatory toxicities will be useful for the identification and early treatment of
ICI-induced irAEs, and it may provide new insights into the pathoetiology and treatment of autoimmune endocrine
diseases."

The accumulation of iron in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients has
been confirmed via imaging, histopathological, and biochemical methods. While iron deposition in the SNc
correlates with severity of motor symptoms in patients, whether it is an early precipitating event in disease or a
consequence of human PD pathology is unknown. Multiple missense mutations in LRRK2 cause autosomal
dominant PD and recent data link wild-type LRRK2 signaling to the far more common sporadic PD. The
physiological and pathological functions of LRRK2 have not been fully elucidated. PD-linked mutations can be
found in the kinase domain (G2019S, I2020T) and the ROC/COR bidomain that harbors its GTPase function
(R144C/G/H, Y1699C). These mutations can differ substantially in terms of protein-protein interactions and
kinase activity, yet each are associated with PD. Recent findings from our group indicate that G2019S results
in iron dyshomeostasis, both in vitro and in vivo. Thus far, however, we have only considered this one mutation
and have relied on heterologous overexpression systems or intracranial LPS injection in homozygous knockin
mice to evoke these changes. Whether iron dyshomeostasis is a conserved feature of LRRK2 mutations
beyond G2019S has not been addressed. Furthermore, it is not known whether endogenous heterozygous
LRRK2 mutation is sufficient to drive basal increases in iron. Lastly, in PD patient brain iron deposition is
observed within the substantia nigra and the impact of various LRRK2 mutations in DA neurons is entirely
unknown. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will differentiate a panel of WT, kinase-domain, and non kinase-domain
LRRK2-mutant iPSCs into cortical and DA neurons. Using selective imaging probes and high content imaging,
we will assess cytoplasmic and mitochondrial iron load in human WT and LRRK2 mutant neurons. Total
cellular iron will be quantified by ICP-MS and the role of LRRK2 kinase activity in these effects will be
examined by selective pharmacological inhibition. Secondly, we will explore downstream effects of cellular iron
by assaying expression of iron-related factors and ROS. These experiments will rigorously and unambiguously
determine whether diverse, heterozygous PD mutations in LRRK2 drive iron dyshomeostasis and whether this
effect differs between human cortical and DA neurons. All pathogenic mutations in LRRK2 converge on the
increased phosphorylation of over a dozen Rab GTPases, including Rab8a and Rab10. The contribution of this
phosphorylation to PD etiology remains unknown. LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation is thought to trap Rabs
in a GDP-bound state effectively inhibiting their function. Recent published and preliminary data from our group
link Rab8a to iron metabolism. Therefore, in Aim 2 we will determine whether Rab8a expression is uniquely
sufficient to rescue iron changes in LRRK2 mutant cortical and DA neurons. If successful, this exploratory R21
will codify a novel LRRK2-dependent phenotype in human neurons and provide compelling data to support a
future R01 to explore the pathologic consequences of LRRK2-driven iron dyshomeostasis in neurons and glia."

 Much research is being done to develop effective neuroprosthetic devices to recover a lost sense.
However, even in the case of a prominent success, such as the artificial cochlear implant devices used for
recovering hearing, the outcome can be limited when the implantation is done later in life. This is often
attributed to the reduced plasticity capacity of the adult brain. This is exacerbated by the fact that even with the
best engineering efforts, neuroprosthetic devices are far from providing the rich array of sensory information
that is generated by the sensory organs. This is largely due to the limited number of electrode contact points,
but also confounded by the difficulties of decoding sensory signals amidst a noisy background. Thus, the
neural activity generated by the sensory prosthetic devices are generally distorted and degraded compared to
those from intact sensory organs. For the brain to effectively utilize information arising from sensory prosthetic
devices, it then becomes essential to rewire the circuitry for optimal processing of the distorted signals.
Blindness can result from various causes but usually spares the thalamocortical circuitry, which can be used as
a substrate to convey artificial signals from visual prostheses to the cortex. Here we propose to utilize a novel
optical thalamic prosthesis analog to examine whether the primary visual cortex (V1) of blind adult mice can be
reconfigured to process artificially generated signals. By combining cutting-edge neurophotonic tools, we
developed a thalamic visual prosthesis analog by coupling an optical fiber bundle to a GRIN (gradient index)
lens implanted in the visual thalamus (dLGN, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus) of blind adult mice. To activate
dLGN neurons using photo-stimulation, we expressed a channelrhodopsin variant in the dLGN neurons. We
have preliminary data that neurons in V1 responds to photo-stimulation of discrete dLGN locations. In this
proposal, we aim to test whether V1 in blind adult mice express sufficient plasticity to form new representations
based on artificial correlations generated from the optical thalamic prosthesis analog. And whether blind adult
mice can learn to detect and discriminate such artificial patterns of thalamic activation to guide behavior. Our
work can be extended to examine the parameters of the artificial signals generated from the optical thalamic
prosthesis analog needed for adult V1 to respond optimally and produce plasticity, as well as determine its
usefulness in guiding naturalistic behavior in blind adults. If successful, the results from our work will
demonstrate the extent of V1 plasticity and learned behavior that can result from artificial signals, which can
benefit future development of effective visual prosthetic devices for recovering vision in blind adults."

Our overarching goal is to understand how the epithelial-specific ER stress sensor IRE1b (ERN2) and its
ubiquitously expressed paralogue IRE1a (ERN1) contribute to intestinal homeostasis and host defense.
A notable adaptation of the ER unique to epithelial cells lining mucosal surfaces, especially in the gut, is
expression of the ER stress sensor IRE1b, a close paralogue of the major and most evolutionarily conserved ER
stress sensor IRE1a. We recently discovered, however, that IRE1b functions distinctly from IRE1a in enzymatic
activity, enabling it to act as a non-competitive inhibitor of IRE1a signaling in the ER stress response. Our new
and ongoing studies demonstrate in vivo that IRE1b operates critically in goblet cell differentiation and assembly
of the mucus barrier - with both activities dependent on the normal gut microbiota: gut microbes and their
products stimulate IRE1b expression, and IRE1b in turn affects the assembly, taxonomy, and functional output
of colonizing gut microbes.
These data frame our central hypothesis that IRE1b acts as an environmentally induced mediator of innate
epithelial host defense by affecting the ER stress response via IRE1a, and then goblet cell development,
mucus assembly, and host epithelial-microbe interactions that shape the structure and function of the colon.
In Aim 1, we will use recombinant proteins and biochemical and biophysical approaches to test how IRE1a and
IRE1b may be activated by gut lumenal factors, explain how IRE1b oligomerizes with IRE1a, and elucidate what
structural features and post-translational modifications modify this assembly, IRE1b signaling, and mechanisms
for IRE1b activation and suppression of IRE1a function.
In Aim 2, we will use wt and IRE1b-/- mice and colonoids prepared from these animals to determine how IRE1b
links the gut microbiota with epithelial stress and development responses and identify core microbial pathways
and metabolites that regulate IRE1b expression and perhaps function.
In Aim 3, we will explain how the lack of IRE1b attenuates recovery from acute infection with C. rodentium. We
found that IRE1b-/- mice have impaired assembly of the colonic mucus layer and dysbiosis - mimicking defects
in the colonic mucosa seen in humans with ulcerative colitis (UC). As modeled by Citrobacter rodentium, the
altered mucus layer in IRE1b-/- mice was associated with impaired recovery following normal clearance of the
pathogen. We will (i) test if the dysbiotic gut microbiota, or unresolved epithelial ER stress, or both, drive the
sustained inflammation following C. rodentium infection in IRE1b-/- mice; and (ii) determine if microbiota obtained
from humans with UC phenocopy these effects and fail to induce IRE1b, goblet cell development, or an effective
mucus barrier when reconstituted in germ-free wt IRE1b+/+ mice.
ER stress is implicated in the chronic inflammatory and other intestinal diseases. The outcomes of these studies
will be informative of the host-microbiota interactions that regulate epithelial development and host defense."

Individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) are susceptible to repeated episodes of hypoglycemia, which can result
in impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH). As a consequence, IAH contributes to diminished recognition of
the need for external glucose and the blunting of counter-regulatory responses that are required to increase
blood glucose. This can be a very risky situation for T1D individuals with IAH, possibly leading to coma and in
some circumstances, death. This can be a very risky situation for T1D individuals with IAH, possibly leading to
coma and in some circumstances, death. Many T1D studies exclude IAH individuals because of confounding
issues. Therefore, the National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDKK) has issued
two RFAs to form the IAH Consortium that will investigate factors which contribute to the heterogeneity of
restoration of awareness of hypoglycemia in adult T1D individuals with IAH. RFA-DK-21-020 and RFA-DK-21-
036 request applications for Clinical Centers and the sole Biostatistics Research Center (BRC), respectively.
The objectives of the IAH Consortium will be to
 • determine if the most up-to-date management strategies using diabetes technology to optimize HbA1c
 while minimizing hypoglycemia can restore awareness of hypoglycemia and improve counter-regulatory
 responses in individuals with T1D and IAH
 • identify the magnitude and duration of time in range, time spent in hypoglycemia or other metrics for
 continuous glucose monitors that are associated with restoration of awareness of hypoglycemia
 • determine the association of current or newly developed self-reported measures of IAH with counter-
 regulatory responses to elucidate the heterogeneity in restoration of hypoglycemia awareness
The Department of Public Health Sciences at The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine proposes
to serve as the BRC for the IAH Consortium, and will pursue seven specific aims.
 Specific Aim 1: Collaborate on the development and conduct of studies, and lead statistical analyses
Specific Aim 2: Lead the Consortium in developing measures of self-reported IAH
Specific Aim 3: House a Central Laboratory
Specific Aim 4: Lead the Consortium in stakeholder engagement
Specific Aim 5: Develop data management and website processes
Specific Aim 6: Maintain regulatory compliance
Specific Aim 7: Provide communication and project management support"

More than 300 million people worldwide are affected by a genetic health condition. Over 4,400 genetic
diseases have been identified; nearly all of which are considered rare, which limits the amount of research
each receives. Gene therapy is an attractive approach for treatment of genetic disease because of its broad
applicability. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing systems (CRISPR) have revolutionized gene therapy research and
other fields of life science, however, no CRISPR-based treatments have reached the market and clinical
application still faces important challenges.
In this project, we aim to develop design automation software to help improve how genetic donor templates are
packaged for genomic integration via CRISPR, thereby increasing CRISPR editing efficiency. Whereas such
templates are usually delivered as unstructured (linear) single-stranded DNA, recent studies indicate genome
integration efficiency is significantly improved when templates are folded into compact shapes using
techniques from DNA nanotechnology. Such nanostructured genetic payloads (NGPs) for CRISPR have the
potential to become an essential component of genetic therapy and personalized medicine. The long-term goal
of the project is to provide researchers with software for designing more effective CRISPR treatments to
improve the lives of people with genetic health problems. Our solution will also advance other application
domains where DNA nanotechnology is being employed, such as nanomedicine, nanosensing and
biocompatible nanomaterials, thereby supporting the mission of the National Institute of General Medical
Sciences (NIGMS): improving the effectiveness of computational approaches in biomedical research.
Academic software exists to facilitate design of DNA nanostructures, however, these applications either require
extensive expertise or are limited to 3D wireframe designs. Design of a novel DNA nanostructure of modest
complexity that is not among a small set of simple designs can require hundreds of hours of expert labor.
Moreover, because NGPs are new to science, no software currently exists to automatically generate DNA
nanostructures for a given set of NGP design parameters. In Aim 1 of this project, we will employ an iterative
design-build-test development cycle we have used to bring other software products to market to develop novel
parametric design software (PDS) able to create NGPs automatically for a given genetic template and set of
design parameters. In Aim 2, we will simulate and synthesize eight NGPs and characterize them via molecular
modeling and atomic force microscopy to confirm they meet design specifications. We will then test these
NGPs for CRISPR editing efficiency against unstructured payload controls in vitro. In Phase II, we will enhance
the PDS and use it to explore the vast space of NGP designs for those that optimize CRISPR performance via
combinatorial testing across multiple cell lines, templates and insertion targets. Ultimately, we aim to
commercialize NGP software and design services to accelerate CRISPR research."

10867274,"The biomedical workforce research needs of our society have increased in size and diversity. We have the
responsibility to help train the next generation of scientists, not only to feed the research needs of academia and
industry, but to train inspiring college science faculty, effective research administrators, science policy makers,
medical writers and scientific editors, business and financial analysts, science consultants, big bioscience data
managers as well as other future essential biomedical research jobs. Thus, our graduates will need to be
equipped with abilities for rigorous critical thinking, develop an interdisciplinary perspective, learn to analyze
complex sets of data, develop complex research approaches utilizing complex equipment while maintaining the
mental flexibility to keep up with the fast pace of biomedical research exploration and application. The overall
goal of this predoctoral program is to offer exceptional interdisciplinary training opportunities in the broad area
of Molecular and Cellular Biology and Genetics with special interest in cell signaling, epigenetics and genome
maintenance. Members of this interdisciplinary program include faculty from the Lewis Katz School of Medicine
(LKSOM), who are mentors in the Cancer Biology and Genetics (CBGN) and the Molecular and Cellular Biosci-
ence (MCBS) concentration clusters. While there are many traditional programs that offer training in each of
these three areas, this program will provide students with the tools and perspectives needed to consider how
these three highly disease-relevant fields intersect.
 The focus for this training proposal was chosen primarily to reflect the presence of multiple leaders in these
fields in the CBGN and MCBS clusters. This proposal will support research training opportunities in the labora-
tories of 36 Assistant, Associate and full Professors. Mentors in this program bring strength in multidisciplinary
programs in molecular and cellular biology, biochemistry, biophysics, genetics and epigenetics, using state of
the art approaches in confocal and TIRF microscopy, mass spec proteomics, structural biology, molecular mod-
eling, bioinformatics, high throughput screens, genomics, and epigenomics using a variety of animal and cellular
model systems and human samples. Mentors in this program have a long tradition in the training of both graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows with very high academic standards and will receive additional training in mod-
ern evidence-based mentoring practices. This program will further provide a broader understanding of disease
mechanisms and will develop in the trainees an in-depth understanding of the clinical challenges associated with
their research interest area. Upon graduating, we are confident that this unique interdisciplinary training experi-
ence will make our students not only highly competitive for future positions in academia, industry, science college
education, research administration, science policy and advocacy, technology transfer, science and medical writ-
ing and scientific editing, business and financial analysis, science consulting, big bioscience data managing and
a broader array of future biomedical research jobs."
10844358,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is prevalent and associated with significant clinical sequelae. Effective treatment
for CUD may be complicated by gender and sex differences in the behavioral, biological, and clinical correlates
of CUD. Women demonstrate more severe withdrawal, more rapid progression from first use to CUD, and
greater likelihood of comorbid psychiatric disorder, while men tend to initiate use earlier and have higher
lifetime prevalence rates of CUD. In other addictive disorders, such as alcohol use disorder, clinical trial
endpoints are sex/gender specific. However, to date, no work has focused on whether different clinically
relevant endpoints may be needed for men and women with CUD. An expert workgroup recently concluded
that reduced cannabis use is a viable alternative endpoint to abstinence in CUD trials, particularly in the
context of changing patient preferences and growing cannabis legalization. However, the amount of reduction
necessary for remission from CUD is unknown and may differ for men and women. An emerging literature
suggests that ovarian hormones play a key role in drug use. Preclinical and clinical research suggests that
endogenous progesterone attenuates drug sensitivity and behavior. Recent clinical studies investigating
exogenous progesterone as a potential pharmacotherapy have shown that it attenuates the subjective and
physiological effects of cocaine and tobacco in drug-dependent individuals. Presently, little is known regarding
the interface of progesterone and CUD, and if fluctuations in progesterone levels may impact ability to reduce
cannabis use. This proposal addresses a key gap in CUD treatment research by empirically-deriving the
threshold of cannabis quantity and frequency of use below which most individuals in CUD treatment can
achieve CUD remission. Importantly, the roles of gender and ovarian hormones in CUD outcomes are
considered and gender-specific endpoints will be derived. Treatment-seeking adults who meet criteria for CUD
(N=224, ages 18+, 50% female) will receive 8 weeks of a psychosocial intervention, including computerized
CBT4CBT. CUD symptoms and detailed information on cannabis use will be collected from participants during
the 8-week treatment period and during a three month follow-up (1, 2, and 3 month follow-up visits).
Participants will complete daily electronic diaries to enhance assessment of self-reported cannabis quantity
and frequency of use, corroborated by weekly assessment of a urinary cannabis metabolite, 11-nor-9-carboxy-
Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol. Daily saliva samples will be collected for assessment of progesterone. Analyses will
examine whether the threshold for cannabis reduction necessary to achieve remission from CUD differs by
gender and the effect of variation in progesterone on successful cannabis reduction. The establishment of
gender-specific reduction endpoints will have both real-world clinical treatment implications as well as enable
future studies to rigorously test promising candidate treatments for CUD."
10833006,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genes that encode subunits of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are mutated in nearly 25% of cancers.
Additionally, germline mutations in SWI/SNF subunits cause several neurodevelopmental disorders. However,
the mechanisms by which these mutations drive cancer and disease are poorly understood. SWI/SNF
complexes mobilize nucleosomes at enhancers and promoters to modulate transcription. Biallelic inactivation of
SMARCB1, a gene encoding a SWI/SNF complex subunit, causes pediatric rhabdoid tumors (RTs). These highly
aggressive soft tissue tumors occur in infants and young children and have extremely poor outcomes. Since RT
genomes are diploid and lack other mutations, they are ideal for studying SWI/SNF-specific mechanisms driving
cancer and for identifying novel therapeutic targets. My mentor and his collaborators initiated the Pediatric
Cancer Dependency Project to identify novel drivers and therapeutic targets in pediatric cancers, including RT.
Performing genome-wide CRISPR screens in 10 RT cell lines compared to over 800 other cancer cell lines
revealed a novel gene that SMARCB1-deficient RT specifically depend upon for survival. This proposal seeks
to investigate the function of this putative chromatin regulator and to determine why it constitutes a
specific dependency in RT. Overexpression of this gene is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers
and thus pharmacological efforts are already underway to develop chemical inhibitors. Intriguingly, preliminary
experiments suggest that this protein may control histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) that dictate
remodeling by SWI/SNF complexes and gene expression. Understanding why RT cells depend on this protein
for survival will reveal novel mechanisms of chromatin regulation and may identify a new therapeutic target in
these lethal cancers. My central hypothesis is that this protein controls histone PTMs and is required for
the chromatin recruitment of the sole family of SWI/SNF complexes that lack SMARCB1, thus making it
essential in RT. This proposal will investigate how this regulator, which lacks enzymatic activity, controls these
histone PTMs and how this influences chromatin accessibility. Additionally, it will determine how this regulator
influences remodeling and gene expression controlled by SWI/SNF complexes. Collectively, this proposal will
uncover the function of this relatively understudied protein, provide novel insight into how chromatin function is
regulated, explain why RTs selectively depend on this protein for survival, and potentially identify a novel
therapeutic target in the lethal pediatric rhabdoid tumor. Additionally, this proposal is designed to address my
training goal of becoming proficient in studying chromatin biology both experimentally and computationally."

More than one million firefighters in the United States provide critical emergency medical services in
communities they serve and have been on the front lines of healthcare delivery, including throughout the
COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of exposure to occupational stressors, a high proportion of firefighters
experience considerable stress-related illness burden, including chronic pain, psychological distress (i.e.,
anxiety and depression), and posttraumatic stress disorder. Although interventions have been developed to
address this high need of reducing effects of occupational stress exposure in order to improve firefighter well-
being (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, resilience training), not all of these modalities appeal to all
firefighters, nor are they easily implemented without direct, in-person contact. One modality that has shown
promise to reduce distress in various populations is meditation, including meditation delivered by smartphone
apps. To the best of our knowledge, no smartphone-based meditation interventions designed to cultivate both
mindfulness and feelings of social connection to others have been tested with firefighters. This study will
therefore test the efficacy of a 10-day, smartphone-based meditation app intervention among N=192 career
firefighters. The app was developed by Health Minds Innovations (HMI, Madison, WI) and is designed to
enhance both mindfulness (awareness) and social connection to others in order to reduce anxiety. Our group
recently piloted tested this app and found that firefighters exhibited reduced anxiety (a key component of
psychological distress) and burnout, as well as improved function of the stress hormone, cortisol, from before
to after use of the app. Although these encouraging results suggest a low-cost, scalable smartphone-based
meditation app may be effective to improve firefighter well-being, our pilot study lacked an attention control
comparison needed to establish intervention efficacy. Therefore, in collaboration with 3 metropolitan fire
departments in the United States, we will test the efficacy of the HMI meditation app to reduce psychological
distress compared to a rigorous active attention control (i.e., a Health Education app, based on our prior
work)(Aim 1). We will also determine whether the effect of the HMI meditation app of psychological
distress is mediated by mindfulness and perceived social connection (Aim 2). The proposed research will
provide important evidence of efficacy about a smartphone-based meditation app intervention, with likely
high impact, that cultivates both mindfulness and social connection in order to reduce psychological
distress in frontline workers in the fire service. This research supports NIOSH's Strategic Goal 7 / Activity
Goal 7.14.1 (to develop interventions that integrate protection from work-related health hazards with
promotion of prevention to advance worker well-being) and NORA Objective 6 (promote healthy work
design and well-being)."

This proposal describes a five-year mentored training experience designed to prepare the applicant for a career
in basic and translational science research. The applicant holds M.D. and Ph.D. degrees, and is certified by the
American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics. The applicant’s long-term goal is to become a physician-
scientist studying the molecular genetic basis of skeletal dysplasias. The career development plan includes
mentorship, formal coursework, lab meetings, seminars, national conferences, and meetings with the advisory
committee. The plan is designed to broaden the applicant’s research skills, including coursework and
experimental learning in model organisms, glycoproteomics, microscopy imaging, and biostatistics. In addition,
the proposed plan will provide training in leadership, mentorship, laboratory management, scientific writing and
editing, grant writing, and the ethical implications of research. The Department of Molecular and Human Genetics
at Baylor College of Medicine has a long track record of training highly successful physician scientists. The
mentor, Dr. Brendan Lee, is a leading expert in the field of skeletal dysplasia and has been the primary research
mentor for over 9 K and VA career development awardees, all of whom have gone onto independent laboratory-
research based careers. The advisory committee was selected to complement the mentor’s expertise and to
provide important research and career guidance for the applicant. The proposed study will investigate the
functional, cellular, and biochemical consequences of COPB2 haploinsufficiency in bone. Loss-of-function
variants in COPB2, a subunit of the COPI coatomer complex, were identified in children with developmental
delay and bone fragility. The COPI functions in trafficking between the ER and Golgi, and within the Golgi
cisternae. Vesicular trafficking defects, including COPI dysfunction, have been implicated in skeletal dysplasia.
Preliminary data demonstrated that Copb2+/- mice exhibit a low bone mass phenotype, and copb2-null zebrafish
embryos show abnormal secretion of procollagen. The applicant proposes that COPB2 deficiency leads to bone
fragility by causing delayed collagen trafficking, Golgi-ER dysfunction, and altered autophagy, resulting in
disruption of osteoblast differentiation. The proposed study involves analysis of the skeletal phenotype in
COPB2-deficient mouse models, including selective deletion of Copb2 in bone during specific stages of
osteoblast cell differentiation (“conditional knock-out”). By taking this approach, the applicant will determine at
which time point during skeletal development the deficiency of COPB2 becomes critical. The proposed study
also aims to check if COPB2 deficiency alters protein glycosylation, and causes an ER-Golgi dysfunction, and
whether these changes may be amenable to therapy. The study will involve the analysis of COPB2-deficient
mouse models and cells. This application, which provides a broad research experience and utilizes advanced
technologies, and the proposed career development plan will prepare this applicant for a career as an
independent research scientist."

world-renowned experts in lymphoma and CLL with non-overlapping technical expertise directly
related to Dr. Soumerai’s proposed K08 research plan and career objectives, and include Jeremy
Abramson MD, Timothy Graubert MD and Andrew Zelenetz MD, PhD. Dr. Soumerai’s K08 career
development plan will provide necessary training in translational biomarker assay development,
advanced biostatistical techniques for biomarker research, regulatory requirements/procedures
and clinical utility evaluation to develop validated biomarkers for clinical use. Research. Validated
predictive markers for response are needed to develop personalized therapies and ultimately to
improve the health and survival of people living with CLL. His central goal is to identify clinically
validated predictive markers for response that help guide development of personalized CLL
therapies. To achieve this goal, he will use his co-mentor’s trial of BCL2 inhibitor (BCL2i)-based
therapy, which modifies therapy duration based on ΔMRD400 status (400-fold minimal residual
disease (MRD) depletion over 4 months) to validate ΔMRD400 as a predictive marker to guide
treatment duration to achieve undetectable MRD (uMRD) and identify high-risk patients (Aim 1).
Next, he will use BCL2i retreatment efficacy data from his co-mentor’s trial to determine if
ΔMRD400 status with prior BCL2i therapy, BALL risk factors for survival (B2-microglobulin,
Anemia, LDH, time from Last therapy), or TP53 mutation/17p deletion can predict BCL2i
retreatment success/failure (Aim 2). Finally, he will subject serial baseline/on-treatment patient
samples from his co-mentor’s trial to PhasED-Seq/CAPP-Seq to identify genomic signatures that
predict for failure to achieve uMRD, which might identify therapeutic vulnerabilities leading to
novel therapeutic approaches (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal/training plan will position Dr.

10818480,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Preschool-age children (3-5 years) from low socio-economic (SES) environments show higher than average
levels of inattention and lower self-regulation, and lower cognitive function (executive function and memory
performance). These disadvantages place them at risk for difficulties, including poor academic performance.
Low SES preschoolers also show slower gross motor skill development. Gross motor skills have been reported
to form the building block for a healthy and active lifestyle since these skills must be mastered before the
development of more complex motor skills. Physical activity, including gross motor skills learning, enhance
neural development, particularly the development of areas associated with cognitive functions, including the
frontal cortex and hippocampus. As such, the underlying hypothesis of this research is that improving gross
motor skills will enhance cognitive functions in low-SES children. Given that most US preschool-aged children
spend the majority of their day in preschool centers, centers are uniquely positioned to help children establish
healthy lifestyles in their custodial role. This application aims to examine the implementation and preliminary
efficacy of a teacher taught gross motor skill-based physical activity (PA) intervention on cognition in low SES
preschoolers. Low SES preschool centers (n=4) will be recruited and randomly assigned to either a Movement
and Cognition (MAC) or a control group. Intervention activities will be embedded into the Massachusetts early
learning standard and implemented by trained classroom teachers. Primary outcome variables will be processed
evaluation data [study fidelity (adherence, compliance, and integrity of study design), intervention dosage,
acceptability, quality, adaptation], and will be assessed throughout the 6-month study. Secondary outcome
variables will be changes in children's cognitive function (executive functions and memory), gross motor skills,
and PA levels at baseline, 3- and 6-month. Aim 1 will examine the implementation of a 6-month teacher taught
gross motor skill-based movement intervention in low SES preschoolers. Aim 2 will examine the preliminary
efficacy of the MAC intervention on cognition, gross motor skills, and PA in preschoolers. If the proposed MAC
intervention is feasible, it will provide preliminary evidence to support the utilization of the intervention to teach
preschool some of their learning standards. It will also provide preliminary support for a subsequent R01
application, where we will conduct a large scale randomized controlled trial to test the benefit of the proposed
intervention in effecting sustained improvements in preschoolers' cognitive health and gross motor skills."
10740905,"Exploratory animal data on potential stroke therapies has not been predictive of clinical success. There
are concerns over the design and conduct of pre-clinical studies, their reproducibility and generalizability. The
response to this challenge was the NINDS Stroke Preclinical Assessment Network (SPAN), an unbiased
multicenter platform for preclinical confirmatory studies in translational stroke research. The MGH team was
among the six laboratories selected by the peer review for this first iteration of SPAN (SPAN-1).
 We made major contributions to the design of SPAN-1. MGH took charge of the MRI protocol for
SPAN-1 and helped develop a fully automated analysis pipeline. We then contributed almost 400 animals in
under 2 years to test six different acute stroke interventions. Each animal underwent two MRIs (days 2 and 30)
and two neurological tests (days 7 and 28). Overall mortality was only ~10% during 28-day survival. Our
technical losses amounted to just 17 animals. There were only 3 protocol deviations or violations. Our
overarching aim is to repeat this success in the next iteration of SPAN (SPAN-2).
 We are an experienced team of clinical and basic scientists capable of adjusting to the needs of the
network. MGH SPAN team has collectively published over 100 manuscripts using various focal cerebral
ischemia models and acute and chronic neurological outcome readouts in rodents. MGH will also bring
additional innovative approaches to SPAN-2, such as introducing MRI readouts for hemorrhagic
transformation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and tractography. We will complement the latter with
optical imaging of resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) at the end of the follow up period.
 Aim 1. Contribute to SPAN-2 as a testing laboratory. We pledge to repeat our success in SPAN-1,
working as a team with the rest of the network and sustaining our high standards with built-in redundancies to
ensure our resilience in the face of personnel changes and disruptive events such as pandemics and weather.
 Aim 2. Introduce innovative new structural and functional indices to enrich the SPAN readouts. We will
go beyond recruiting subjects for the trial by introducing innovative readouts such as hemorrhage, edema,
structural and functional connectivity, and histological analyses, which have not been part of SPAN-1.
 Aim 3. Test whether an unbiased, multicenter, randomized, and blinded preclinical trial network can
confirm or refute the published exploratory efficacy and safety data. We hypothesize that SPAN will have the
statistical power and an unbiased structure to provide conclusive evidence confirming or refuting published
exploratory data of prospective cerebroprotective therapies in ischemic stroke in combination with reperfusion.
 For over a decade, we have advocated for and passionately supported the concept of an unbiased
multicenter preclinical testing platform. We enthusiastically worked as part of SPAN-1 to ensure its success.
And now we are fully committed to support SPAN-2 to make it a success as well."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia has emerged as a major burden on the healthcare system and a major
barrier to human longevity, especially productive human longevity. Genetics of familial early-onset AD,
pathological changes in the brain of sporadic late-onset AD patients and pathological changes in the brain of
individuals with Down syndrome, who frequently have increased expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP)
owing to partial trisomy of chromosome 21, all point to APP and its cleavage product amyloid β (Aβ) peptide as
major causative factors in AD pathogenesis. However, other factors may also play a role. The genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) of the architecture of common genetic predisposition to AD, genetic investigations
of rare loss-function mutations and studies in mouse models of AD have implicated ATP-binding cassette
transport subfamily A member 7 (ABCA7) in AD pathogenesis. A closely related protein, ATP-binding cassette
transport subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) has been implicated in AD in the GWAS and animal studies. In our
preliminary data, we show that individuals with low ABCA7 protein levels have a greater risk for developing AD
pathology. Both ABCA1 and ABCA7 mediate formation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles from cell
lipids. In preliminary data, we show that ABCA7- and ABCA1-HDL significantly differ in the lipid composition.
Recently, we published the altered lipidostasis hypothesis that draws on the paradigms provided by ABCA1
and another ABC A transporter, ABCA4, and poses the existence of a neurodegenerative lipid that
continuously arises during normal physiology and promotes AD pathogenesis when it is not eliminated from
neural cells by ABCA7. ABCA1 and ABCA4 eliminate from specific cells deleterious lipids that these cells
accumulate during normal function. The purpose of the present exploratory project is to conduct comparative
ABCA7 vs ABCA1 studies in specificity of lipid efflux in neural cells and to test the prediction of the lipidostasis
hypothesis of AD that in the neural tissue ABCA7 mediates efflux of a specific lipid species (i.e., the
neurodegenerative lipid) that is not effluxed significantly by ABCA1. To test this prediction, we will use
metabolic radioactive labeling of lipids/high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) and
multidimensional electrospray
ionization
`shotgun' mass spectrometry lipidomics to compare ABCA7- and
ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux/HDL and the effects that this efflux/HDL formation has on the lipid composition of
the plasma membrane and whole cell in microglia C20, astrocyte glioblastoma A172 and neuroblastoma SK-N-
SH cells inducibly expressing ABCA7 or ABCA1."

Most of breast cancer related mortality is related to metastatic disease. While NK cells play an essential role in
the control of metastatic breast cancer we do not fully understand key mechanistic and temporal events of NK
cell immunosurveillance. To address this need, I created novel 3D co-culture assays of NK cells and invasive
breast cancer organoids and cell clusters. Using these models I demonstrated NK cells limit breast cancer
metastasis through induction of apoptosis in invasive breast cancer cells. We discovered micrometastatic
cancer cells reprogram NK cells to promote metastatic outgrowth. Using bulk RNA-seq, we identified KLRG1
as a key expressed gene by teNK cells. Blocking KLRG1 restores anti-metastatic activity. teNK cells also
express high levels of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Inhibition of DNMTs in teNK cells achieves anti-
metastatic results. Combination KLRG1 blockade and DNMT inhibition further reduces tumor growth.
 Building on these exciting data, we hypothesize: 1) reprogrammed teNK cell KLRG1 expression is
regulated by DNMTs and targeting both in combination will reverse NK cell reprogramming; 2) reprogrammed
human NK cells increase human breast cancer metastasis and blocking prioritized NK cell inhibitory receptors
restores the cytotoxic activity of metastases-reprogrammed human NK cells.
 Aim 1 will determine how blocking DNMTs and KLRG1 synergistically reverses NK cell reprogramming.
We have observed blocking KLRG1 and DNMTs together in teNK cells synergistically reduces colony
formation. We will first test these ex vivo findings in in vivo models of metastasis. Next, we will determine the
link between NK cell reprogramming and DNMTs using novel functional ex vivo and in vivo models of
metastasis using CRISPR-Cas9 molecular tools.
 Aim 2 will determine the function of metastases-reprogrammed NK cells in human breast cancer. First,
we showed that human NK cells can be reprogrammed in culture to actively promote metastatic outgrowth. We
will leverage preliminary transcriptomic analysis of reprogrammed NK cells to identify markers of metastases-
reprogrammed NK cells. We will apply these tools to FFPE sections of patients with metastatic breast cancer
to define the abundance of reprogrammed NK cells. Together with patient samples, single-cell RNA-seq, and
ex vivo and in vivo models that capture the progression from anti-metastatic NK cells to metastases-promoting
NK cells, we will further characterize the function and molecular profile of reprogrammed NK cells in human
breast cancer. Finally, using a preliminary list of targets, we will test effective individual or combination
treatments that can restore human NK cell cytotoxicity against metastatic breast cancer cells.
 Impact: Completing these aims will deepen our fundamental understanding of NK cell biology and have
the potential to bring new NK cell directed immunotherapies to our patients."

We and others have shown that altered hemodynamics and shear stress can lead to congenital heart defects
(CHDs), but still there is limited information on how these forces affect molecular signaling. Studying the impact
of abnormal hemodynamics and shear stress becomes even more urgent when we consider that perturbed blood
flow may be a contributing factor to a large percentage of CHDs regardless of whether the initial trigger is
environmental or genetic. Although our group and others have recently developed extremely useful optical
imaging tools (e.g., optical coherence tomography – OCT) to assess hemodynamics and shear stress, and
connected these measurements to CHDs, it has been difficult to link shear stress with the affected molecular
pathways. Our group and others have performed qPCR experiments on control and shear-stress perturbed
hearts to see how abnormal hemodynamics alters gene expression. However, this approach requires the entire
embryonic heart for one measurement, missing all spatial and cell-type information, particularly at the
endocardial layer. In order to successfully assess how shear stress affects molecular signaling throughout the
looping heart, we need to improve upon our OCT methods, develop 3D methods for assessing embryonic heart
gene expression, and create an advanced image processing pipeline to analyze data and relate regional shear
stress to gene expression.
 This renewal proposal will continue our work developing tools that can lead to a more sophisticated
understanding of how cardiac function (e.g., hemodynamics and electrical impulse conduction) affects heart
development, enabling potential therapies to avoid or mitigate CHDs. In this proposal, we will focus on developing
tools to understand how oscillatory shear stress (quantified as oscillatory shear index - OSI) influences gene
expression and leads to CHDs. In our preliminary studies, we increased regurgitant blood flow (causing
increased OSI) to show that alterations to OSI leads to smaller cardiac cushions (valve precursors) and
ultimately, to CHDs. Increased regurgitant blood flow and smaller cushions is present in our two disease models
(fetal alcohol spectrum disorders – FASD; velo-cardio-facial syndrome/Digeorge) and our FASD prevention
compounds partially normalize blood flow, cardiac cushion size, and greatly reduce morbidity and CHDs.
 Our specific aims include 1) advance our OCT system and shear stress analysis, 2) develop fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) protocols to measure gene expression in 3D, 3) develop an image processing pipeline
to relate gene expression to shear stress, and 4) determine the impact of shear stress on gene expression. Upon
completion, we will have significantly more information on how shear stress affects molecular expression. With
this knowledge, we will be better equipped to determine which molecular pathways are most influenced by altered
hemodynamics, to develop earlier detection methods and potentially develop strategies to prevent CHDs more
effectively."

 1 Cystic fibrosis is one of the most common autosomal regressive genetic disorders in the United States:
 2 approximately 1 out of 32 Caucasians and 1 out of 61 African Americans is a CF carrier. A hallmark of this
 3 disease is recurrent respiratory infections. However, cystic fibrosis requires two copies of the CFTR
 4 mutation. Traditionally, one non-mutated CFTR gene was thought to be sufficient for maintaining health.
 5 However, a few small studies and preliminary work by our group have demonstrated that CF carriers may
 6 be at increased risk for respiratory infections, including recurrent sinusitis, pneumonia, and atypical
 7 mycobacterial infections, than non-CF carriers. Given an estimated population of 15 million CF carriers in
 8 the United States, if carriers are more likely to acquire respiratory infections, the attributable burden of
 9 respiratory infections and corresponding antimicrobial use attributable to the CF-carrier state may be
10 substantial. Thus, there is a critical need for population-based investigations to precisely determine the
11 attributable risk of the CF-carrier state for respiratory infections.
12 The goal of our research is to determine the role of the CF-carrier state on the risk for acquiring respiratory
13 infections. Due to the frequency of genetic testing for CFTR mutations for genetic counseling, it is possible
14 to identify CF carriers in some existing population-based data sets. Our group has recently demonstrated
15 that CF carriers are at significantly greater risk for respiratory infections compared to age and sex matched
16 controls. However, more work is needed that considers other patient characteristics as well as patients'
17 specific CF mutations. In addition, the biological plausibility of these findings needs to be established. Thus,
18 we will determine the natural history of respiratory infections for CF carriers using administrative claims
19 data; determine the risk for respiratory infections among CF carriers in a genotyped cohort using data from
20 electronic medical records, and assess airway epithelial function in CF carriers compared to non-carriers.
21 This work is significant because respiratory infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality; CF
22 carriers are common and can be identified by current genetic counseling methods; and there are CFTR-
23 modulating therapies available that may be cost-effective treatments for CF carriers with excessive
24 respiratory infections. This work is innovative because all previous work in this area has been done using
25 small cohorts of patients, and we will have access to a large cohort of CF carriers and controls. Also, we will
26 be able to identify the CF carriers using diagnosis and procedure codes in administrative data and the
27 medical record an in one cohort we will be able to identify specific CFTR mutations.
28 Given the number of CF carriers in the general population, the methods and models we develop will have
29 broad implications for other diseases beyond respiratory infections."

Sleep disorders and obesity are inextricably linked – poor sleep quality and short sleep duration increase the
risk of developing obesity, while obesity is an independent risk factor for chronic sleep disruption (CSD) and
excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Despite a clear bidirectional and pernicious association between obesity
and sleep disorders, the neural substrates mediating this association remain largely unknown. Our research
program seeks to identify critical neural circuit linking metabolic alterations to CSD and EDS. Our long-term
goal is to delineate the neural circuits underlying metabolic regulation of sleep-wake behavior. We have
recently found that adipocyte-derived metabolic hormone, leptin, promotes wakefulness and chemogenetic
activation of a subset of GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) expressing leptin receptor
(LepR) completely disrupts sleep in mice. The overall objective of this research proposal is to clarify how leptin
acts on key hypothalamic neurons to affect normal sleep-wake cycle. Build upon strong preliminary data, the
central hypothesis is that circulating leptin acts on a subset of LHA LepR-expressing GABAergic neurons to
affect sleep-wake behavior through their projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and/or preoptic area
(POA) and thereby contribute to CSD and EDS commonly associated with obesity. We will test our hypothesis
by pursuing following two specific aims: 1) determine if the LHA is a key site mediating the action of leptin on
sleep-wake regulation and 2) determine if leptin engages LHAVTA and/or LHAPOA circuits to regulate
sleep-wake behavior. Advanced neuroscience techniques will be employed to answer these questions,
including Cre/loxP technology, optogenetics/chemogenetics, in vivo fiber photometry, and electrophysiology
coupled with chronic wireless recording of EEG/EMG in freely moving animals. The proposed research is
significant because it is expected to not only advance and our understanding of hypothalamic regulation of
sleep-wake behavior but also shed light on largely unknown mechanisms that connect metabolic disorders to
sleep-wake regulation. The proposed research is also innovative because it utilizes a combination of state-of-
art neuroscience techniques coupled with sophisticated physiological measurements to address an important
yet largely under-investigated question – what are the underlying neural circuits mediating CSD and EDS in
obesity? Such knowledge may ultimately lead to the development of a novel strategy to effectively manage
sleep problems associated with obesity in human patients."

During motor learning, the cerebellum encodes memories of sensorimotor associations that predict deviant
action and, during recall of these associations, it will impose adaptive changes to instill corrective behavior. This
memory process depends on plasticity that alters the output of the cerebellum through learned patterns of
Purkinje cell spike output. Molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) are excited by parallel fibers that convey
sensorimotor information relayed through the mossy fiber pathway and, in turn, exert feedforward inhibition onto
postsynaptic Purkinje cells to reduce their spike output. MLI synapses are plastic and therefore may be
susceptible to learning-induced modification that would alter their inhibitory influence on Purkinje cells and, in
this way, impart adaptive behavior. Yet, a basic understanding of how MLIs are affected by experience and if
their activity is necessary for the expression of learning is unknown, creating a knowledge gap in the
understanding of cerebellar function. Therefore, the objective of this study is to elucidate the role of MLIs in
adaptive motor control in behaving mice and measure for learning-induced plasticity in their response properties.
This will be accomplished in two aims. In the first, we will use electrophysiology and genetically encoded effectors
of activity to measure and manipulate MLI responses in vivo during a motor-learning behavior: adaptation of the
vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). This will allow us to determine if learning alters how MLIs are activated during
sensorimotor stimulation and if their inhibitory output is necessary for pattern changes in Purkinje cell spiking
and the expression of learned eye movements. In the second aim, quantitative measurements from cerebellar
slice preparations of mice that gave undergone VOR learning will be used to determine if MLIs show activity-
induced plasticity in their synaptic properties. This study encompasses an innovative, multidisciplinary approach
to decipher the cellular- and circuit-level mechanisms that allow the cerebellum to encode memories of motor
learning and implement adaptive motor behavior. Completion of these aims will contribute to novel insights into
understanding how the cerebellum stores and recalls memories of learning."

Project description: The NIA’s Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) Milestone 8 focuses on the
development and translation of non-pharmacologic interventions and is particularly timely given four facts.
First, existing pharmacologic agents have shown limited success. Second, the number of older adults with
ADRD is rapidly increasing. Third, mounting evidence indicates that non-pharmacologic interventions can
enhance cognition and everyday functioning, potentially delaying clinical decline. Fourth, no Milestone 8 goals
have been accomplished to date. Thus, the primary goals of the proposed Research Program on Cognition
and Neuromodulation Based Interventions (RP-CNBI) are to create a sustainable and robust infrastructure
(Goal 1), provide thorough training to the next generation of ADRD researchers (Goal 2), and develop
consensus statements and centralized analytic platforms (Goal 3). Infrastructure will include access to well
characterized older adults with ADRD, a neuroimaging platform that facilitates treatment planning and outcome
evaluation, cutting-edge equipment, a tele-video-health platform, treatment and outcome measure repositories,
dedicated staff to support studies, and pilot funding. Training provides a mixture of didactic and experiential-
based learning, including mentorship from an international panel of experts in cognition-oriented treatments
(COTs) and neuromodulation, and both salary support and travel funds for junior faculty and post-doctoral
fellows. We will hold two consensus meetings that establish practice standards and identify knowledge gaps in
years 2 (focused on COTs) and 5 (focused on neuromodulation), which directly address Milestone 8A. To
provide empirical support for these meetings, we will refine a beta-version of a centralized repository of COT
trials, known as CogTale, and develop a neuromodulation-based analogue that will be known as NeuroTale.
These repositories contain key methodological and outcome details of relevant clinical trials and automatically
calculate quality indices and effect sizes used to perform automated meta-analyses on selected data. The RP-
CNBI is extremely well positioned for success given the outstanding research environment at the University of
Michigan, including the NIA P30 funded Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, and VA Ann Arbor
Healthcare System. The PI’s role as vice-chair (ascending to chair in 2021) of the Alzheimer’s Association
Non-pharmacologic Intervention Professional Interest Area (NPI-PIA) expands the Program’s reach by making
collaborative and mentoring opportunities available to a wide range of professionals interested in ADRD,
especially those from underserved populations and developing nations. Although physically located at the
University of Michigan, the RP-CNBI leverages the post COVID-19 integration of virtual (tele-/video-/internet-
based) to create a collaborative, widely-accessible program that is agnostic to geography. The combination of
these resources will enhance methodologic rigor, training, and access to resources necessary for high-quality
non-pharmacologic intervention research, collectively enhancing Milestones 8A-E."

Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPIs) experience a disproportionately higher prevalence of
cardiometabolic diseases, primarily Type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM), than other U.S. racial/ethnic populations.
Compared to White residents, NHPIs have a ~2.5-fold higher incidence and earlier onset of diagnosed DM with
significant differences in DM disparities appearing at age 35. NHPIs also have the lowest levels of educational
attainment, lowest mean income, highest rates of poverty, and higher exposures to DM risk factors compared to
other major racial/ethnic groups in Hawaii, and also reside in environments that include low neighborhood
socioeconomic status (nSES). The coincidence of disparities in DM prevalence and adverse social environments
implicate complex interactions that may impact gene pathways relevant to the onset of DM. However, the
interactions between the social environment and biological mechanism(s) that underlie DM health disparities of
NHPIs are unknown. The detrimental effects of social environments, such as nSES, may include an increased
prevalence of chronic low-grade inflammation known to contribute to DM. Epigenetic mechanisms (e.g. DNA
methylation) regulate transcription of pro-inflammatory genes of monocytes, a key mediator of inflammation. Our
preliminary data in NHPIs with DM that completed a lifestyle intervention revealed significant genome-wide
changes to the DNA methylation and gene expression states of pro-inflammatory genes that were associated
with their monocyte inflammatory activity and glycemic control. In another study, we observed significant
changes to the gut microbiome, dysbiosis of which may also be an underlying attribute of DM, in NHPI youth that
correlated with social network influences and health behaviors that modified their risk for DM. Lifestyle-
associated changes to the gut microbiome impacts DNA methylation through bioavailability of substrates
essential to the epigenetic machinery. Thus, we propose a hypothesis that the social environment conditions
the epigenomic landscape and gut microbiome composition that regulate inflammation and metabolic pathways
underlying DM. To test this hypothesis, we aim to identify an epigenetic signature of DM risk in monocytes from
a new cohort of NHPIs and that of their social networks, and examine associations with neighborhood- and
interpersonal-level social factors using a cross-sectional study design (Aim 1). We will then explore the
mechanistic basis to which this signature may underlie innate DM-relevant traits by examining associations with
inflammation, inflammatory activity, and gut microbiome composition/diversity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine
the degree to which this signature may prospectively be predictive of DM outcome (Aim 3). Addressing these
aims will yield novel datasets of NHPIs in a health disparate population for determining the relationship between
the “immunoepigenetic-gut microbiome axis” and DM risk within the context of the social environment and
provide new insight into the etiology of DM disparities in NHPIs, with generalizable implications for improving
early identification of DM to enable preventative strategies in populations suffering from social/health inequities."

The two PLC-gamma isozymes (PLC-gamma1, -gamma2) are central to the relay and amplification of signals originating from numerous receptor tyrosine kinases and immune receptors, including the B and T cell receptors. When this control is dysregulated, the PLC-gamma isozymes contribute to inflammatory and immunological diseases as exemplified by various leukemias and lymphomas. For example, PLC-gamma1 is the most frequently (~40%) mutated protein in patients with adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma; the mutated proteins are invariably constitutively active. Similarly, mutated, constitutively active forms of PLC-gamma2 arise in response to treatment of B cell leukemias and lead to refractory disease. Despite the obvious causality between the PLC-gamma isozymes and hematologic cancers, there are no chemical probes or breakthrough therapeutics that specifically target the PLC-gamma isozymes. This deficiency arises mainly from our incomplete understanding of how the PLC-gamma isozymes are regulated as well as inadequate tools to monitor this regulation in a manner amenable to high-throughput screens. 
We recently determined the first structure of a full-length PLC-gamma isozyme at atomic resolution and used it to develop an allosteric model of its regulation. In addition, we created XY-69, the first fluorescent, membrane-bound analog of PIP2 that reliably captures the allosteric activation of PLC-gamma isozymes in response to either extracellular stimuli or mutation. In preliminary studies, we show that XY-69 can be used to identify both orthosteric and allosteric inhibitors in high-throughput screens. Consequently, the overall objective of this proposal is to identify selective inhibitors of the PLC-gamma isozymes to be used as chemical probes and leads for drug development. 
Two Specific Aims will be pursued. In Aim 1, we will use a novel high-throughput screen to identify drug-like compounds that selectively inhibit the PLC-gamma isozymes. In Aim 2, these compounds will be profiled and prioritized for further optimization using a battery of biochemical, biophysical and cellular assays that emphasize T cell biology and chemotaxis. Ultimately, these inhibitors will be essential, high-demand probes used to dissect cellular processes controlled by the PLC-gamma isozymes. Moreover, these inhibitors will be promising leads for the development of drugs to treat various hematologic cancers driven by the PLC-gamma isozymes."

The major long-term objective of this research program is to understand the mechanisms of regulation of RNA
polymerase II transcription in animals. Why is it important to study gene expression? The basis of a diverse
range of biological phenomena, including many human diseases, can be traced to the proper or improper
expression of a gene or set of genes. Thus, new insights into the mechanisms of gene expression will have a
far-reaching impact upon the biological sciences. Specific emphasis will be placed upon the study of the RNA
polymerase II core promoter, which is the short stretch of DNA that directs the initiation of transcription. Why is
it important to study the core promoter? First, the core promoter is the ""gateway to transcription"" – the site of
convergence of the signals that lead to transcription initiation. In this regard, the core promoter is at a key
strategic position in the transcription process. Second, the core promoter is a central and integral component
of the RNA polymerase II transcription system that comprises the signals in the chromatin (including DNA
sequence motifs) and the factors that read those signals and carry out the transcription process. At present,
core promoter elements are best understood in organisms other than humans. The human core promoter,
which is complex and difficult to decipher, is the next challenge. Hence, future goals include the elucidation of
the components of the human core promoter and the identification and analysis of the transcription factors that
function with specific sequence elements to mediate the regulation of gene expression in humans. This work
should provide new and important insights into the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in humans. A
second objective of this research program is to understand the diverse functions of chromatin – the natural
form of DNA in the eukaryotic nucleus. Because DNA is the genetic material and is thus of the utmost
importance, there is a strong and broad interest in the factors and mechanisms that affect chromatin and DNA
structure and integrity. In particular, these processes will be investigated at the interface of chromatin and
DNA – that is, in the context of chromatin rather than with DNA alone. One particular area of interest is the
study of factors that protect DNA from damage by binding to nucleosomes. New insights into the protection of
DNA against damaging agents such as reactive oxygen species would not only provide important fundamental
knowledge of cellular function, but would also be relevant to the understanding and prevention of cancer."
10857278,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Patients with cirrhosis have increased surgical risk relative to the general population Several risk factors have
been established to predict cirrhosis surgical risk. These are reflected in the primary clinical tools used for risk
prediction—the Model for End-stage Liver Disease-sodium (MELD-Na), Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score, and
the Mayo surgical risk score—which rely on age, cirrhosis severity, ASA physical status score, and etiology of
liver disease. However, significant heterogeneity in post-operative mortality by surgery type (e.g., cardiac
versus orthopedic) suggests that these tools are inadequate. The literature on cirrhosis surgical risk prediction
is further limited by: 1) single-center designs with small sample sizes, 2) lack of granular data for risk
prediction, 3) evidence of poor prediction score calibration, 4) lack of key stakeholder involvement to inform
real-world implementation of prediction tools, and 5) no incorporation of decision analysis methods to compare
surgery to non-operative management. The impact of these shortcomings is that many patients with cirrhosis
are denied necessary surgery due to overestimates of risk, and others receive surgery with inaccurate
prognostic counseling or inadequate consideration of non-operative options. Granular, population-level data
are needed to address the above gaps. By using national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and University
of Pennsylvania Hospital System (UPHS) data, we hypothesize that we will be able to create and implement
an accurate, well-calibrated cirrhosis surgical risk calculator with broad clinical utility. The primary aims of this
proposal are as follows: Aim 1 – derive, internally validate, and externally validate cirrhosis surgical risk
models for short- and intermediate-term post-operative mortality among diverse patients with cirrhosis.; Aim 2
– create a web application for surgical risk prediction informed by key stakeholder input.; Aim 3 – use Markov
modeling to compare operative to non-operative management pathways and determine optimal clinical
decisions for a common clinical scenario: acute cholecystitis. This proposal will foster Dr. Nadim Mahmud's
development as an independent, NIH-funded clinical researcher with a focus on improving risk prediction for
patients with chronic liver diseases, as well as specific expertise in advanced prediction modeling, qualitative
methods, and decision analysis. This will be facilitated through a comprehensive mentorship plan consisting of:
1) biweekly to monthly meetings with his mentorship team, 2) formal coursework in advanced prediction
modeling, qualitative research methods, and decision analysis through the Center for Clinical Epidemiology
and Biostatistics (CCEB), Wharton School, Department of Health Policy Research (HPR), Operations,
Information, and Decisions Department (OIDD), and Department of Statistics (STAT) at the University of
Pennsylvania, 3) structured research workshops and national conferences, and 4) conception, development,
and submission of future grants during the latter portion of the award period to further explore issues related to
surgical risk prediction among patients with cirrhosis."

Our long-term goal is to build a network-level and single-cell understanding of the interplay between genetic,
epigenetic and signaling mechanisms that determine the state of MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway dependency in
tumor cells. Such understanding will be key to our ability to predict and ultimately improve the responsiveness
of tumor cells to therapeutic inhibitors of MAPK signaling. Our focus, in this application, is on BRAFV600
mutated cancers, particularly melanomas, where hyperactivation of MAPK signaling has motivated the clinical
evaluation of MAPK-targeted therapies, but they often lead to variable responses and no durable cure in most
patients. While genetic alterations are associated with late resistance, epigenetic heterogeneity associated with
tumor differentiation state or tissue lineage and its adaptive plasticity within a tumor influence the dynamic
state of BRAF/MAPK dependency, thereby diminishing the therapeutic efficacy of MAPK inhibitors. Here, we
propose a systems pharmacology approach to test the hypothesis that heterogeneity in the state of MAPK
dependency may result from a subset of key epigenetic variations across tumor cells of heterogeneous
differentiation states. To identify regulator of such variations, we screened 276 small-molecule epigenetic
modulators individually or in combination with BRAF/MEK kinase inhibitors in melanoma cell lines that
represent a wide spectrum of differentiation states. Integrating multiplexed single-cell analysis with multivariate
statistical modeling and genetic experiments, we identified three classes of inhibitors that target seemingly
distinct epigenetic states in melanoma cells: (1) a lysine demethylase 1A (KDM1A)-dependent state associated
with undifferentiated (AXLHigh), MAPK inhibitor-resistant (p-ERKHigh) cells, (2) a Jumonji histone demethylase
(Jmj-KDM)-dependent state associated with neural crest-like (NGFRHigh/AXLLow) cells, and (3) a state induced
by BET bromodomain inhibitors in NGFRHigh cells, which substantially enhances their requirement for MAPK
signaling. Single-cell analysis shows that these states might co-exist in different combinations and frequencies,
highlighting mutual epigenetic vulnerabilities among genetically diverse melanoma cell populations. In this
proposal, we aim to: (1) examine the molecular specificity of the identified small molecule inhibitors as well as
mechanisms that govern each of the phenotypically consequential epigenetic states, (2) identify predictors of
epigenetic switching in BRAF-mutated cell lines and patient-derived tumors, and (3) test new epigenetic
strategies to overcome heterogeneous populations of MAPK inhibitor-tolerant cells in vitro and in vivo. This will
be achieved through a systems pharmacology approach, combining genetic experiments, high-throughput
single-cell imaging, proteomic measurements, and network-level computational modeling. We will use these
tools as a means to measure, model, modulate and ultimately overcome heterogeneous populations of drug-
tolerant cells. Our work is expected to provide rational approaches to improve the clinical benefit and durability
of treatment response in patients with melanoma and potentially other BRAF-mutated cancers."

Patient safety is paramount in anesthesia. Intraoperative complications and hemodynamic instability are
associated with reduced long-term survival and can lead to risks such as myocardial injury, stroke, kidney
injury, and even death. Therefore, predicting and preventing intraoperative hemodynamic instability is very
important in the decision-making process of anesthesia providers. An ideal pre-operative assessment system
would predict, from patient information, all intraoperative complications and physiological changes before a
surgical procedure begins. Predicting intraoperative hemodynamic instability during surgery requires analyzing
an enormous amount of physiological data and spotting patterns in that data before adverse events occur.
However, doing this requires a large volume of high-resolution intraoperative data taken directly from the
physiological monitors in the operating room to train machine learning models, and these data currently are
unavailable. Therefore, the research goal of this proposed training program is to generate a continuous
multivariate intraoperative physiological time series that display the effects of anesthesia management using
state-of-the-art mathematic tools. The generated data can provide unlimited and realistic intraoperative data to
identify intraoperative complications and later build a real-time intraoperative clinical decision support system.
The proposed training program has two aims. Aim 1 will enable the applicant to create a data-driven objective
approach for intraoperative complication prediction and risk assessment. Key information from anesthesia pre-
op assessment will be used to generate synthetic low-resolution intraoperative physiological data. This data
will inform anesthesia providers of the type, timing, and range of a given patient’s intraoperative hemodynamic
instability and complications before surgery. Aim 2 will enable the applicant to build a virtual database that will
provide unlimited high-resolution intraoperative data to train machine learning algorithms for a future real-time
intraoperative clinical decision support system. The recorded low-resolution intraoperative data and the key
information from anesthesia pre-op assessment will be inputted into the second tool to upscale existing minute-
resolution intraoperative data to second-resolution level for data augmentation to boost the number of available
surgical cases. This K08 research program will enable the applicant to fill key knowledge gaps in applying data
science in the existing low-resolution intraoperative data in medical records and non-recorded high-resolution
intraoperative data displayed by anesthesia devices. The results will orient anesthesia providers and
researchers in the design and implementation of data-driven perioperative prediction systems over traditional
anesthesia risk assessment. Ultimately, this K08 award will provide the applicant with the senior mentorship,
skills, research experience and data resources to become an independent nurse investigator after training."
10824284,"The long-term goal of the PI’s research program is to understand how RNAs exert their regulatory effects through
interaction with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and identify the basis for their therapeutic effects in human diseases.
RBPs interact with RNAs to form ribonucleoprotein complexes that that control the fate of nearly every transcript.
These roles are essential for normal human physiology, as defects in RBP function are implicated in autoimmunity,
neurodegeneration, cancer, and innate antiviral immune response.
The molecular mechanisms of RNA-protein
interactions (RPIs) that underpin gene expression and form the basis of numerous human diseases remain
obscure. Consequently, RBPs are rapidly emerging as promising targets for the development of chemical probes
and candidate therapeutic agents. The discovery of therapeutically tractable RPIs, however, remains a formidable
challenge. This proposal describes an interdisciplinary program leveraging quantitative chemoproteomics, natural
product synthesis, molecular biology, and biochemistry to exploit reactivity of proteinaceous lysines at the RPI
interface that modulate the structural properties of ribonucleoprotein complexes. Preliminary findings from the PI
demonstrate that phloroglucinol meroterpenoid natural products modulate RPIs through reversible-covalent
modification of RNA-binding lysines in RBPs. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that high occurrence of
reactive lysines at the RPI interface may provide an unprecedented opportunity in the development of precision
chemical tools with specificity for RBPs and on-target potency gained through reversible-covalent modification.
 The proposed research program embodies three integrated projects that address specific challenges in
targeting RBPs in human cells. First, the lack of traditional enzymatic pockets or functional epitopes renders RBPs
as canonically intractable targets. This proposal aims to overcome this challenge through reversible-covalent
modification of RNA-binding lysines at the RPI interface using phloroglucinol meroterpenoids. Second, the full
complement of lysines with heightened reactivity at the RPI interface remains unexplored. This proposal aims to
overcome this limitation by using innovative chemoproteomic methods to globally map lysine reactivity and
ligandability directly in human cells. Last, the functional consequences of meroterpenoid-lysine interactions remain
obscure. By leveraging integrative RNA pulldown and extraction methods with RNA-interactome capture and
immunofluorescence imaging, the proposal aims to identify advanced tool compounds that perturb RPIs through
site-selective modification of lysines in RBPs. Overall, the proposed research program is significant because over
the next five years it will deliver innovative chemical tools and proteomic methods that enrich understanding of the
pathophysiological functions of RPIs and identify the basis for their therapeutic effects in human diseases.
This proposal offers progress in a number of NIGMS major research programs, including fundamentals of
molecular properties and interactions (BBCB), coding and noncoding RNA mechanisms of action and function
(GMCDB), and new methods and targets for drug discovery (PPBC)."
10761739,"Background: Ten percent of patients account for up to 70% of acute care costs. Among these “super-utilizer”
patients, homelessness is a robust social determinant of acute care utilization. Through a field-based
dashboard and clinical aids, the Hot Spotter Analytic program assists Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) with
targeting and tailoring care for the highest-need homeless Veterans. However, many Veterans identified by the
Analytics do not engage in supportive services that reduce risk for acute care utilization. Peer Specialists (PS)
are a high-value workforce that can facilitate Veterans’ engagement in care. Yet, there is a need to enhance
the PS role with a structured approach that can capitalize on known facilitators of care engagement among
homeless Veterans. Whole Health Coaching (WHC) is one such approach. By focusing on patients’ values and
goals rather than treatment of specific conditions, WHC reduces patients’ stigma regarding their care needs
and increases patient activation and well-being, which can increase engagement in supportive services.
Significance: By training a high-value workforce in a patient-centered approach to care that facilitates
engagement in supportive services, our proposed research can reduce homeless Veterans’ reliance on acute
care services, thereby minimizing the financial burden these patients exert on the care system. This proposal
responds to several VA HSR&D Research Priorities including Mental Health, Healthcare Value, Primary Care
Practice, Healthcare Informatics, and Whole Health, as well as VA-related Legislative Priorities (MISSION Act).
Innovation and Impact: A critical innovation of this research is use of data-driven processes (Hot Spotter
Analytics) to better target and tailor care for high-need, homeless Veterans in VHA. Our proposed research is
also innovative in that it seeks to integrate the Analytics with a workforce (PS) and approach to care (WHC)
that are rapidly expanding in primary care services VA-wide. These features of our target intervention are
consistent with the National Academy of Medicine’s recommendations for high-quality care for high-need
patients. Finally, by focusing on the development of personal health goals that are aligned with patients’
priorities and values, WHC is a key innovation to be added to existing VHA services for homeless Veterans.
Specific Aims: The goal of this project is to integrate use of Hot Spotter Analytics with Peer Specialists trained
in Whole Health Coaching (PS-WHC) and evaluate whether this approach reduces homeless Veterans’
frequent use of acute care. Aim 1: Conduct an RCT to test whether receipt of PS-WHC (vs. Enhanced Usual
Care; EUC) predicts (1a) lower acute care utilization, (1b) better health-related outcomes, and whether (1c) the
effects of PS-WHC on 1a and 1b are mediated by increased (i) patient activation and well-being, and (ii)
access to supportive services. Aim 2: Conduct a process evaluation to inform VA's potential widespread
implementation of Hot Spotter Analytics + PS-WHC on PACTs. Aim 3: Conduct a Budget Impact Analysis (BIA)
to determine the impact on total costs of VA care due to implementing PS-WHC.
Methodology: Using a Hybrid Type 1 design at the Palo Alto and Bedford VAs, 220 Veterans on PACT panels
who are (i) on the VA Homeless Registry, and (ii) persistent super-utilizers of acute care will complete a
baseline interview, be randomized to either EUC (usual PACT care + Hot Spotter Analytics and text reminders
of appointments) or EUC plus 12 sessions of PS-WHC over 12 weeks, and be re-interviewed at 3, 6, and 9
months. For Aim 2, the CFIR framework will guide key informant interviews with 7 PACT staff/leaders and 12
patients from each site. For the BIA, we will include only VA costs from VA, Fee Basis care, and Choice care.
Costs will be estimated per patient for all treatment beginning with randomization and continuing for 9 months.
Next Steps/Implementation: Depending on the results, we will work with our VACO partners in the National
Center for Homelessness Among Veterans, the Office of Patient Centered Care & Cultural Transformation, and
the Office of Mental Health & Suicide Prevention to conduct a large multisite implementation trial."
10851435,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This SBIR Fast-Track project will develop a novel mobile health framework for left ventricular end diastolic
pressure diagnostics and monitoring, using an innovative, non-invasive cardiac biosensor. Heart disease is the
leading cause of death for men and women accounting for more than one-third (33.6%) of all U.S. deaths. The
total costs associated with cardiovascular disease in the U.S. were estimated to be $363 billion, making it the
costliest health problem facing the nation. In addition, it occurs disproportionately among minority and health
disparity populations. For example, heart failure related deaths are 30% higher among African-Americans than
among non-Hispanic whites. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) is a reflection of ventricular
compliance and intravascular volume and pressure; it relates both acutely and chronically to clinical conditions
that affect ventricular performance. LVEDP is elevated in the setting of heart failure (HF), and its measurement
is used in the management of HF. Overall cardiac health can be significantly improved by proper triage at the
primary care level by determination of the LVEDP without requiring a 2-D echo-cardiogram or left heart
catherization. It will provide health care professionals with technology to guide diagnostic and facilitate easy
home-based management by patients. Using everyday smartphones makes it even more accessible and
readily available without adding high costs. As the technology being developed does not require skilled
operators or specially trained physicians, it will allow healthcare providers to assess LVEDP within their normal
medical training. Through the course of this project we will validate this revolutionary mobile health framework
that enables measurement of LVEDP using everyday smartphones. The scope of the science proposed in this
project is to complete development of the diagnostic framework using our specially engineered sensor system
combined with the novel algorithm technology to be accessed via a smartphone for a portable and cost-
effective solution. Resource-poor communities across the globe lack access to quality healthcare arising from
shortages in medical expertise and poor availability of expensive medical diagnostic devices. In recent years,
mobile phones have become increasingly advanced and ubiquitous. The mobile framework developed through
this project is a tremendous opportunity to provide low-cost diagnostics to under-served populations. The
benefit of this pioneering work is the development of an easy-to-use solution that can measure ventricular
compliance, and thus enable improved screening during routine annual checkups, doctor visits, at community
medical screenings, classes, and health fairs leading to healthier communities. It will make measuring LVEDP
as routine as measuring blood pressure. In Phase II, we will continue validation of the device through user-
trials and seek FDA 510(k) clearance for commercialization. Followed by commercialization in the Florida and
nationwide, based on the partnerships and joint collaborations established to help create a commercially
successful product."

 Objectives: The median age of veterans in 2018 was 65 and women make up the fastest growing share of
veterans, estimated at 17% by 2040 (American Community Survey). Almost 25% are over 75 years old and
68% are 55 and older. Aging is associated with an increased vulnerability to a number of diseases including
osteoporosis with the associated increased risk of fracture. Fractures have serious health consequences
including lengthy rehabilitation and the most serious, hip fractures, may cause prolonged or permanent
disability and almost always require hospitalization and major surgery. A recent retrospective, secondary
analysis of National Veterans Health Administration Medicare beneficiaries concluded that one in three elderly
male veterans who sustain a hip fracture die within one year. Another retrospective study of 41,331 veterans
determined that approximately 18.3% of hip fracture patients were readmitted within 30 days and of those
48.5% died within one year. Therefore, prevention of fractures would represent a significant health intervention,
improving longevity as well as quality of life in the veteran population. Nutritional intervention as a means to
modulate health and disease represents a promising area of opportunity to improve health although sufficient
data does not currently exist to optimally take advantage of this strategy.
 Research Plan: We have identified inorganic phosphate that is consumed in great excess by Americans as a
nutritional element that strongly influences inflammation and bone quality and might be manipulated for
improvement of bone mass and quality. Therefore, the goals of this study are to further investigate the value of
controlling phosphate intake for the improvement of bone quality and reduction of inflammation. Our published
and preliminary data strongly support the working model and hypothesis that high dietary Pi intake results in
changes in the microbiome, compromised intestinal integrity, and chronic inflammation leading to bone loss,
while a reduced Pi diet is beneficial to bone volume and reduces inflammation. Growing evidence strongly
suggests that the gut microbiota can have profound systemic influence on health and disease although the
details are only beginning to be uncovered. How, individual environmental elements such as nutrients alter the
gut microbiota is even less understood. Pi is required for cell and bacterial growth and excess Pi is known to
positively influence cell growth, and in some cases cause deregulated growth, leading to our general
hypothesis that a sustained high Pi diet results in changes to the microbiome composition which results in
inflammation and bone loss.
 Methods: Proposed studies will utilize a comprehensive series of innovative mouse models including Germ-
Free, antibiotic treated, and T cell tracking mice to; 1) To determine if a sustained high phosphate diet
generates increased intestinal inflammation, 2) To identify the mechanisms whereby the gut microbiome
influences high dietary phosphate-induced bone loss including intestinal permeability and changes in
microbiome content, and 3) To determine if the microbiome can be manipulated to modulate Pi homeostasis
and bone metabolism.
 Clinical Relevance: Prevention of fractures will greatly reduce both the personal and financial burden to
veterans relative to post-fracture treatment. These studies will be the first to investigate the effect of the
common nutritional element particularly relevant to the dietary habits of Americans in Pi on gut inflammation
and long-term changes to the gut microbiome. Results could unveil new clinically relevant prevention strategies
to modulate mineral homeostasis that have broad consequences on health and disease."

Accumulating evidence indicates that AD patient physical function gradually declines long before cognitive
symptoms warrant a clinical diagnosis of dementia. These early changes often develop in regions that promote
and coordinate motor function. Located throughout the central nervous system, they extend via peripheral
nerve pathways into musculoskeletal structures. Elucidating these motor mechanism(s) may point toward
effective AD interventions.
In AD, loss of lean muscle mass precedes brain atrophy and cognitive impairment by several years. AD
patients show reduced physical activity, suggesting that associated behavioral changes may result in loss of
lean mass. However, even after controlling for physical activity levels, lean mass is independently associated
with brain volume, so the decline in physical activity observed in AD does not fully explain accelerated loss in
muscle mass and strength (sarcopenia) in early AD. We propose that damage to brainstem sympathetic
neurons (SNs), which regulates cognitive and skeletal muscle function, leads first to sarcopenia, then cognitive
impairment.
We propose that a subgroup of pontine noradrenergic neurons (A5) that project to spinal cord intermediolateral
column (IML) preganglionic and, through them, to postganglionic SN and hindlimb muscles (Sympathetic
Neurons Projecting to Hindlimb Muscles, SNPHLM), regulates motoneuron function, neuromuscular junction
(NMJ) transmission, and skeletal muscle innervation, mass, and strength. The remaining A5 neurons synapse
with several targets, including the locus coeruleus (LC) neurons (A6), which are essential to maintaining
cognitive function,but not with the NMJ. With AD, A5 SNPHLM become susceptible to cumulative damage,
which accounts for early motor deficits. Optogenetics, chemogenetics, and viral vector retrograde neuron
labeling provide new opportunities to define the role of A5 SNPHLM in AD muscle pathology and function.
The aims of this project are: (1) To define the role of A5 SNPHLM in muscle motor denervation, impaired NMJ
transmission, decreased norepinephrine (NE) release at the NMJ, and diminished adrenoceptor GPCR-
mediated signaling in the early, middle, and late stages of AD; and (2) To determine whether chemogenetic
modulation of A5 SNPHLM at various stages of AD enhances skeletal muscle sympathetic and motor
innervation and delays or reverses accelerated sarcopenia.
This project will define the role of central autonomic neurons in AD sarcopenia and predict disease
progression. Analysis of autonomic central regulators of skeletal muscle structure and function will enable
detection of predementia AD and formulation of effective treatments for each disease stage."
10841549,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Patients with advanced ovarian cancer experience a complex array of physical symptoms and bear a
disproportionately high burden of psychological distress. Patient-centered communication (PCC) is associated
with better health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with cancer and is essential to high-quality
gynecologic cancer care. However, few communication interventions have improved HRQoL in patients with
cancer. One possible explanation is that most communication interventions have limited scalability. To date, no
known intervention has aimed to assist patients with ovarian cancer and their clinicians to routinely engage in
PCC. Without such an intervention, the potential for PCC to improve health outcomes may go unrealized.
Another obstacle to developing interventions to promote PCC is that optimal assessment of PCC includes
objective ratings of patient and clinician behavior. Investigators typically rely on trained coders to identify PCC
behaviors during audio-recorded clinic visits. This resource-intensive approach lacks feasibility for studies with
large samples. Novel methods for assessing PCC behaviors are needed to advance the field. Natural language
processing (NLP) is approximately ten times faster than manual coding and may identify information that human
coders miss. However, the feasibility of using NLP to assess PCC behaviors is unknown.
The overall objective of the proposed research is to refine and pilot test a collaborative agenda-setting
intervention (CASI) to facilitate PCC in ovarian cancer care. The specific aims of this project are to (1) assess
the usability and acceptability of the CASI and identify barriers to its implementation; (2) assess the feasibility of
a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the CASI to usual care; and (3) assess the feasibility of using
NLP to assess PCC behaviors. Data will be collected through think-aloud interviews, usability and acceptability
surveys, and a two-arm, parallel-group pilot RCT.
The proposed career development plan will prepare me to advance toward independence by (a) applying
principles of implementation science to enhance intervention scalability; (b) gain experience designing,
conducting, and analyzing and disseminating data resulting from randomized trials; (c) develop expertise in using
NLP to analyze unstructured text; (d) strengthening skills in grantsmanship, scientific communication, and
leadership; and (e) building a network of interdisciplinary mentors and collaborators. These objectives will be
achieved through a combination of mentored research experiences; didactic training; and scientific meetings at
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, and the Harvard School of Public Health.
The proposed research and training plan relates directly to the mission of the National Institute of Nursing
Research. This project will (a) pilot test an innovative health technology to improve HRQoL, (b) use a person-
centered perspective to implement new models of care, and (c) train the nurse scientists of the 21st century."

Alzheimer’s disease is a serious neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people. Currently there are
no effective therapies and the reliance on managing the disease depends on accurate diagnosis and
assessment of progression. In our grant application we aim to identify biomarkers for differential diagnosis
between Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders and also, biomarkers that are able to
non-invasively assess the progression of the disease. We postulate that Alzheimer’s disease is
pathogenesis is multifactorial and includes the classical amyloid hypothesis and other, evolving hypotheses.
We postulate that at least some patients develop AD due to autoimmune reactions between autoantibodies
 present in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) against brain specific proteins. Our preliminary studies have
clearly shown that some patients with Alzheimer’s disease possess either autoantibodies or autoimmune
complexes in cerebral spinal fluid. By using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry we will identify such
autoantibodies or immune complexes in a discovery phase, using a highly sensitive and specific assay that we
recently developed. Once we identify candidate molecules in cerebral spinal fluid we will collaborate with a
company, MesoScale Diagnostics, to develop targeted assays for about10 autoantibodies/immune complexes
that can be assessed first in cerebral spinal fluid and later in serum. In association with an excellent biobank in
Barcelona Spain (collaborator Dr. Morato) we will obtain high quality samples with clinical annotations from
patients without Alzheimer disease, with mild moderate and sever Alzheimer disease and patients who have
progressive or non-progressive disease. By using these valuable samples we will do the discovery
experiments the first year followed by targeted assay development in the second year. Once we complete
these objectives we intend to mound an extensive validation process to identify a group of
autoantigens/immune complexes that can be used for differential diagnosis and monitoring of AD disease
progression. We believe that our discovered biomarkers will be fundamental in clinical trials which are testing
new agents which may be able to slow down or halt the disease at an early stage."

10856905,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major risk factor for developing neurological disorders.
Cumulative evidence from clinical follow-up of returning Veterans demonstrate at least 2-4 times
higher risk of dementia and cognitive decline compared to matched non-TBI Veterans. The
current interventions for post-TBI dementia are limited, and there are currently no therapies that
have shown to prevent, stop, or reverse cognitive decline in patients who have experienced either
mild or severe TBI. There is increasing evidence that a chronic neuroimmune/inflammatory
response induced by TBI plays a central role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative
disorders. However, this response can vary greatly between different types of brain injury and can
vary at different stages after injury. We propose to investigate the neuroimmune/inflammatory
response that occurs and develops chronically after severe focal contusion injury vs. mild diffuse
concussive injury. The complement system is a key mediator of inflammation, and the focus of
this proposal is the role of complement in chronic neuroimmune responses and
neurodegeneration that occurs after these different types of brain insults. Understanding
differences in post-TBI neuroimmune responses, as well as regional differences, will permit the
design of appropriately tailored therapies, including complement inhibitory therapies, according
to the type and stage of injury. Overall, the aims of this proposal are to investigate the role of
complement in pathophysiological regional responses after contusion versus concussive injuries,
to compare neurobehavioral outcomes after contusion versus concussive injuries and determine
associations with post-traumatic neuroinflammation and pathology, and finally to investigate the
role of CNS derived complement vs. peripheral complement, as well as immune cell complement
receptors in chronic pathology after either contusion or concussive injuries."

 Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is highly prevalent in the elderly, especially post-
menopausal women. Heart failure affects ~7-8 million patients in the United States, with HFpEF accounting for
more than 50% of all cases. The disease is a consequence of multiple comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension,
obesity, and renal dysfunction). Cardiac and limb muscles are the main organs affected in patients with HFpEF
and the main determinants of disease development and progression. Intrinsic myocyte abnormalities in older
patients with HFpEF appear to stem from mitochondrial dysfunction. However, there is no disease-specific
treatment for HFpEF. Current pharmacotherapies provide limited improvements in exercise tolerance in
patients and do not resolve the cardiac and limb muscle abnormalities. The mechanisms of HFpEF
development and progression are phenotype-specific, and a prevalent subgroup of patients with HFpEF
consists of older postmenopausal women with multiple comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, obesity, insulin
resistance/diabetes). We have developed a preclinical model of postmenopausal HFpEF that recapitulates the
exercise intolerance and essential cardiovascular, muscle, and systemic features of the disease in older
women. Data from our lab and others show diminished cardiac and limb muscle mitochondrial respiration and
contraction/relaxation dysfunction, which are accompanied by increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and oxidative stress. Increases in mitochondrial ROS impair respiration, contraction and relaxation, and
lower fatigue resistance. Therefore, excess mitochondrial ROS is a potential determinant of skeletal muscle
abnormalities and exercise intolerance in HFpEF. Our preliminary data suggest that excess mitochondrial ROS
in HFpEF is due to impaired mitochondrial glutathione transport. An antioxidant compound shown to increase
mitochondrial glutathione transport and decrease ROS in hepatocytes prevents the increase in mitochondrial
ROS induced by in vitro mimics of HFpEF in cultured muscle cells. Therefore, we propose to test the
hypothesis that systemic antioxidant treatment restores cardiac and limb muscle function and exercise
tolerance in a model of postmenopausal HFpEF. This is a novel approach to treat cardiac and limb myopathy
and exercise intolerance in postmenopausal HFpEF. The antioxidant is readily available for human
consumption and routinely used in the clinical setting. Hence, positive effects in our pre-clinical studies can be
translated immediately to clinical trials in patients."
10783757,"Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for the development and progression of glaucoma
and is due to damage to the trabecular meshwork (TM) leading to impaired aqueous humor outflow. We
have shown that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an important receptor involved in the development of ocular
hypertension and TM damage. Fibronectin extra domain A (FN-EDA) is a known damage associated
molecular pattern (DAMP) and endogenous ligand of TLR4. FN-EDA is produced because of tissue damage
and remodeling, leads to pathogenic TM damage, and is increased in the glaucomatous TM. Herpes simplex
virus 1 (HSV-1) is a ubiquitous human virus that establishes a lifelong latent infection. HSV- 1 is taken up by
peripheral nerve termini that innervate ocular structures, and the virus is retrograde transported to neurons
in the peripheral ganglia including the trigeminal ganglia (cornea) and ciliary ganglia (TM). After entering
neurons latency is established and latent HSV-1 genomes reactivate in response to external stressors,
including those that activate the TLR4 pathway. Importantly, recurrent ocular episodes of HSV-1 are a
leading cause of corneal blindness in the US and worldwide, yet little is known about the connection between
HSV-1 and other blinding eye diseases, such as glaucoma. It has been previously shown that HSV-1-
induced ocular inflammation leads to elevated aqueous proteins and inflammatory cells as well as damage
to TM cells, which can impede aqueous outflow and cause ocular hypertension. HSV-1 is a known cause of
secondary elevated IOP and glaucoma and is also associated with Glaucomatocyclic Crisis, a syndrome
characterized by recurrent attacks of ocular hypertension. However, it is unknown whether increased
intraocular pressure and DAMP-induced TM damage facilitate reactivation of latent HSV-1. We hypothesize
that the presence of DAMPs in the glaucomatous TM reactivate HSV-1 in the ciliary ganglia, leading to
recurrent HSV-1 reactivation and inflammation resulting in additional damage to the TM. Here we propose to
combine a novel in vitro human neuronal cell line capable of supporting HSV-1 latency and reactivation with
an in vivo rabbit ocular model of HSV-1 infection to determine if the presence of DAMPs in the TM result in
reactivation of latent HSV-1 leading to progressive damage to ocular structures. Specific aims 1 will
determine whether HSV-1 infection causes TM damage and DAMP production, and Specific aim 2 will
determine whether DAMP activated TLR4 signaling leads to HSV-1 reactivation in neurons. The overarching
goal of this project is to determine how HSV-1 might contribute to the pathogenesis associated with
glaucoma."
10793650,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive and degenerative joint disease with an increasing prevalence in the aging
population for which existing treatments targeting the primary symptom of pain are only minimally successful.
The manifestation of OA is heterogeneous with symptomology differing across individuals. This disease
heterogeneity has made identification of reliable and consistent molecular biomarkers elusive. This has in part
hindered the progress toward development of specific therapeutic treatments. Therefore, the identification of
specific biomarkers of OA clinical phenotypes and longitudinal changes over disease progression is required.
 To begin addressing this issue, here we propose an initiative for the discovery of plasma extracellular RNA
(exRNA) expression signatures genomic signatures of OA among diverse clinical and progressive phenotypes.
exRNA has been demonstrated in a variety of complex diseases to have prognostic and biological value. The
experiments will utilize the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) which is a prospective, longitudinal multicenter cohort
study of nearly 5000 subjects diagnosed with radiographic knee OA or at risk for the disease. We will first cluster
the entire OAI cohort into distinct clinical phenotypes based on biochemical assays, imaging data, and clinical
symptom questionnaires and identify exRNA signatures associated with those phenotypes using high throughput
RNA sequencing (SA1). Furthermore, we will identify individuals with progressive OA defined as progression by
radiograph changes over time as well as increasing pain over time. We will then generate longitudinal time-
course profiles of exRNA expression to deduce biological mechanisms of that progression (SA2).
 By generating specific phenotype definitions, this study has increased power to identify molecular signatures
of these OA groups. This will be an important step toward harnessing the value of functional genomics as a
biomarker in the precision medicine of OA."
10735901,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The enjoyment of fat-rich foods has benefitted our species by providing necessary energy, as well as lipid
components that are crucial for growth and development. Thus, it is no surprise that fatty acid detection
components have been recently identified in taste tissue, likely evolved for the necessary intake of energy and
essential fatty acids. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has recently been implicated in both the detection of
and reward conferred by fatty acids in fatty foods. These detection and reward systems serve to increase intake
of triglyceride-rich foods, which is evolutionarily advantageous. Today, an overabundance of LCFAs, especially
omega 6 and saturated fatty acids, are present in processed foods and snacks (doughnuts, ice cream, etc.),
adding to the growing global obesity phenomenon. In particular, the anabolic ECS that drives consumption by
strengthening fat intake reward is damaging health in the Western food environment. We presently seek to
understand how the endocannabinoid system impacts oral fatty acid detection and the hedonic evaluation of
fatty, palatable foods, as well as how these parameters are altered in obese individuals. These experiments will
allow us to understand how to develop therapeutic targets of the ECS in order to sensitize ‘fat taste’ and reduce
the desire for and consumption of fatty foods in obese individuals."

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in enormous loss of life and in long-lasting health sequalae in a subset
of convalescent patients. Little is known about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on people with primary
immune deficiency diseases (PIDD). There is also a lack of guidelines regarding the inclusion of people with
PIDD in SARS-CoV-2 vaccination efforts.
Among PIDD, primary antibody deficiencies are most prevalent. X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a genetic
disorder that is estimated to occur in 1 of 200,000 births and is caused by a mutation in Bruton tyrosine kinase
(BTK) that leads to an arrest in B cell development. Thus, XLA patients cannot mount antibody responses and
require lifelong therapy with gammaglobulin infusions to prevent infections. These infusions, however, do not
contain antibodies to the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus leaving these patients vulnerable to COVID-19.
The currently approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are thought to mediate protection against infection through the
induction of neutralizing antibodies. However, all current SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates have the potential to
elicit humoral and T cell responses. Although T cell responses cannot protect against viral infection, anti-viral T
cell responses are critical in the control of virus replication and dissemination. In XLA patients, T cell responses
are considered to be normal. Thus, we hypothesize that the currently approved SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines
will elicit persistent Spike protein-specific T cell responses with the potential to protect against disease against
the vaccine strain and variants of concerns. Support for our hypothesis is provided by data documenting that
XLA patients receiving the inactivated influenza vaccine can mount protective influenza-specific T cell responses
at a similar magnitude and quality as immunocompetent individuals. Aim 1 of the proposed studies will assess
magnitude, function, durability, and breadth of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in XLA patients prior to
and at week 1, week 3, 4 months and 1 year after vaccination and/or boost with one of the two approved SARS-
CoV-2 Spike protein mRNA vaccines. XLA patients, however, can encompass a broad spectrum of BTK
mutations. Some BTK mutations can inhibit Toll-like receptor signaling and other innate functions in monocytes
and dendritic cells. Both monocytes and dendritic cells are important in the priming and activation of antigen-
specific T cells. Therefore, Aim 2 of the proposed studies, will assess the function of monocytes and dendritic
cells in XLA participants and correlate these functional parameters to vaccine-induced T cell responses in the
same patient. To perform the studies, we will leverage well-established cohorts of XLA patients at Duke, UNC,
and USF. The results of our study are expected to inform health policies regarding the inclusion of XLA patients
in SARS-CoV-2 vaccination efforts and provide the foundation for larger studies with other PIDD populations."

 The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a major target organ for viral infection in bats, but infections rarely cause
typical symptoms of viral enteritis such as diarrhea. The long-term goal of our project is to understand the
specific innate immune response mechanisms of the intestinal epithelium that enable bats to sustain viral
infection without experiencing cytopathic effects and intestinal barrier dysfunction. We hypothesize that
protective type I and type III interferon (IFN) responses in Jamaican Fruit Bats (Artibeus jamaicensis, JFBs)
enable persistent, asymptomatic viral infection of the gastrointestinal epithelium. To test our hypothesis, we will
utilize a novel in vitro model of the JFB intestine, 3-D enteroids, which are complex long-term cultures of
primary intestinal epithelial cells generated from adult tissue-derived stem cells. Responses in the gut
epithelium of JFBs will be compared to those induced in human enteroids. In Aim 1, we will define type I/III IFN
responses of JFB enteroids to viral infection. In Aim 2, we will determine to what extent type I/III IFNs impact
viral replication and barrier function in the gastrointestinal epithelium of JFBs. We will analyze intestinal
epithelial cell responses to three single-stranded RNA viruses that can infect JFB cells: H18N11 influenza
virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and Cedar virus, a non-pathogenic
henipavirus. Specifically, we will analyze the kinetics of viral replication and type I/III IFN activation in the
enteroids and will also perform a comprehensive proteomics analysis of virus-infected intestinal epithelial cells.
To assess the role of virus-induced type I/III IFNs for gastrointestinal epithelial pathology, IFN signaling will be
induced or inhibited, and the impact on enteroid susceptibility to viral infection will be analyzed. We also will
measure epithelial cell viability, barrier and repair functions that are commonly disrupted during viral enteritis.
Our project is technologically innovative, because we will, for the first time, analyze viral infection in enteroid
cultures derived from JFBs and because we also will perform a complete proteome analysis of the JFB
intestinal epithelium. The proposed work is conceptually innovative, because it will define how virus-induced
type I/III IFNs impact intestinal epithelial function and integrity. Our proposed work is significant, because it will
provide novel insights in the epithelial cell-intrinsic innate immune mechanisms involved in asymptomatic
infection of the bat intestine with viral pathogens, which has important implications for potential pathogen
spillover events."
10738797,"Chronic allograft rejection remains a major obstacle to long-term success of solid organ transplantation despite
improvements in immunosuppression and advances in costimulation blockade. Following immune injury,
vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) switch from a differentiated contractile to a synthetic phenotype and
proliferate, resulting in intimal expansion and vascular compromise, often causing ischemic organ failure.
Allograft-specific regulatory T cells (Treg) may inhibit immune cells without immunosuppression but their direct
effects on the pathologic VSMC phenotype switch have been insufficiently studied. Moreover, Treg heterogeneity
and plasticity associated with complex post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by microRNAs
represent challenges for cellular therapies requiring expansion of Treg ex vivo. We hypothesize that mRNA-
specific enhancement of translation can skew the secretome of the alloantigen-specific Tregs toward promoting
VSMC homeostasis. This exploratory, developmental (R21) project will design and evaluate a novel approach
to promoting vascular smooth muscle cell homeostasis in the context of immune responses to vascular allografts
through modulation of the Treg secretome. In Aim 1, we will identify Treg-enriched secreted products promoting
VSMC homeostasis. We will expand alloantigen-specific Treg and identify clones that secret factors with
favorable effects on VSMC phenotype. Using two complementary secretome analyses (multianalyte
immunoassays from Isoplexis and pulsed SILAC followed by LC/MS-MS), we will select 2-3 Treg-enriched
factors for modulation. In Aim 2, we will design and evaluate locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified mRNA target
site blockers (TSB) that specifically relieve miRNA-mediated translational repression and enhance production of
IL-10, as our model candidate, and newly identified Treg-enriched targets, to promote VSMC homeostasis. The
effects of the TSB on Treg and VSMC phenotype will be evaluated in vitro, followed by validation in 2 in vivo
models: (1) factor-enhancing effect on secondary lymphoid organ antigen-activated Treg, and (2) vascular-
stabilizing effect on minor antigen (HY) mismatch aortic allografts. The results of this exploratory study will newly
reveal specific regulatory networks of Treg-VSMC interactions and provide a proof of concept for a novel class
of therapeutics directed at improving long-term vascularized allograft outcomes."

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder that involves the selective loss of midbrain dopamine (mDA)
neurons in the substantia nigra. Human stem cells, such as embryonic (hESCs) and induced pluripotent
(hiPSCs), represent a powerful technology to study and potentially treat PD. Methods to generate mDA neurons
from human stem cells have been pioneered by our group. Such work enabled applications of mDA neurons for
modeling PD in a dish and for the development of cell-based therapies. In fact, based on our work, the
transplantation of human mDA neurons is at the verge of clinical testing in PD. Despite such progress, current
strategies for generating mDA neurons are suboptimal and the resulting cells do not match all the molecular
features of mDA neurons in the brain. In addition, there are no reliable purification methods to specifically
enrich for mDA neurons. The lack of such methods is a problem, particularly in disease modeling, where mDA
neurons are compared across cell lines from many PD patients and where variability in yield can be a major
confounding factor. Furthermore, the use of purified mDA neurons will allow more precise transplantation
studies to define optimal graft composition. Another important challenge is the limited survival of mDA neurons
after transplantation (~10% of grafted cells), a problem that remains unresolved, and that can cause variability
in cell dosing and complicate the routine application of this technology. A final challenge is the lack of
knowledge how to preferentially generate mDA neurons of either A9 (substantia nigra) or A10 (ventral tegmental
area) identity. Both A9 and A10 are mDA neurons, but they represent subtypes with different molecular and
functional properties, and with A9 being the desired subtype for disease modeling and cell therapy in PD.
 Here, we propose three specific aims to address these outstanding questions. In Aim1, based on exciting
preliminary data, we will refine our mDA neuron differentiation strategy to obtain mDA neurons with improved
molecular and functional properties and a sorting method that will enable routine purification of mDA neurons.
We propose the use of single cell gene expression analysis to assess whether mDA neurons under such
improved conditions more fully match mDA neurons in the developing or adult brain. In Aim 2, we will define the
factors that limit survival of mDA neurons upon cell transplantation. We have developed a very promising,
CRISPR-based screening technology to define survival factors, and already identified candidates acting either
directly within mDA neurons or via the host environment. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use single cell gene expression
and chromatin accessibility studies to map A9/A10 subtype diversity of mDA neurons from human stem cells.
The results from those in-depth single cell profiling studies will be used to identify and test factors that are
functionally important in subtype specification. Each of the three aims addresses a critical and complementary
challenge in the mDA field towards unlocking the full potential of human stem cell-derived mDA neurons for cell
therapy and human disease modeling."
10819141,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a therapeutic challenge, making the identification of new targets
and development of novel treatment strategies for this disease of paramount importance. Our LONG-TERM
GOAL is to advance context-dependent, mechanism-based paradigms for the improved use of epigenomic
inhibitors in cancer. Epigenomic machinery, and hence their inhibitors, are typically only considered within the
context of their actions in gene expression, or interphase, even though they are operational during different
stages of the cell cycle. During the process of DNA replication, for instance, not only is the entire genome
replicated, but the accompanying chromatin structure is duplicated as well. Thus, conceptually, DNA
replication represents a vulnerable moment for challenging genomic and epigenomic integrity, which relies
heavily on the proper functioning of the S-phase DNA replication checkpoint (DRC) and DNA damage
response (DDR) as critical components of this process. Early in tumorigenesis, higher proliferation rates
driven by activated oncogenes, such as KRAS, trigger replication stress (RS), which if not tolerated causes
cell senescence or death. RS tolerance, consequently, becomes vital to tumor progression, yet the underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we will test the CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS that the epigenomic
regulator G9a promotes RS tolerance in PDAC via a mechanism which involves interactions with S-phase
DRC-DDR pathways, representing actionable vulnerabilities for therapeutics. Completion of these studies will
significantly advance the field by: 1. revealing mechanisms by which G9a functions in the tolerance to
oncogene-induced RS, a key understudied event in tumorigenesis, 2. providing novel mechanistic insight into
how G9a-mediated function in DDR signaling protects replication fork integrity to offer additional targeting
strategies for the subset of patients with inherent DDR deficiencies, and 3. leveraging the function of
epigenetic regulators during oncogene-driven RS as a mechanistic opportunity to synergize with RS-
enhancing drugs, such as DDR-inhibitors. In summary, we seek to extend our studies on new mechanisms
that represent previously unrecognized actionable vulnerabilities for cancer cells. We are optimistic that the
outcome of this research will impact planning for future clinical testing of therapies that may share similar
mechanisms to offer much-needed, novel treatments for PDAC."
10909808,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of motor neuron disease (MND).
Several reports have highlighted a link between some disease-causing genes and the immune
system. However, whether and how immune cells contribute to MND in specific forms of ALS is
yet to be defined.
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 4 (ALS4) is a rare and juvenile MND caused by mutations in the
gene SENATAXIN (SETX), which encodes for a nuclear helicase ubiquitously expressed that our
group identified as a transcriptional regulator of inflammatory response.
By using a mouse model of ALS4, we found that the hematopoietic system contributes to the
neurodegenerative process. Additionally, we discovered that CD8 T cells in the CNS and the
peripheral blood of disease-affected mice and patients are aberrantly activated. Our goal is to
define the role of CD8 T cells in disease initiation and progression. We will determine the function
of disease-associated CD8 T cells by transfer and depletion experiments and immune-histological
characterization in mice (Aim 1). We will assess molecular pathways of neuro-immune
interactions during disease by network modeling of transcriptomic and correlation-structure
analyses (Aim 2). Finally, we will validate the presence of activated CD8 T cells in mouse models
and patients with other forms of ALS (Aim 3). Our
contribution
of
results will provide a deeper knowledge of the
of CD8 T cells in ALS and open potential avenues for their use as immune biomarkers

Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is an insidious consequence of joint injury, ~50% of patients with knee-
injuries exhibit PTOA within 10-years of injury. Presently, no cure for PTOA exists, but the acute nature of the
precipitating injuries provides for a unique approach to PTOA treatment: targeted prophylactic pharmaceutical
intervention to mitigate/prevent the initiation of disease post-injury. Many pre-clinical investigations for targeted
treatment have been conducted. However, due to incredibly rapid intra-articular (i.a.) drug clearance, disease-
modifying drug efficiency is highly limited, requiring repeated high-dose administration of free drug for efficacy.
Give the inefficiencies of i.a. administration of free drug, delivery approaches that extend drug-residence time
by targeting the tissues of the injured joint could represent a cost-effective method of increasing therapeutic
efficacy. We propose a novel and versatile platform for the thermally responsive, localized delivery of candidate
PTOA drugs to injured joints to limit initiation/progression of PTOA. Our approach relies on our pioneering
development of elastin-collagen-peptide conjugates that uniquely form cargo-laden nanovesicles that facilitate
long-term passive release at body temperature and accelerated-/burst-delivery at mildly hypothermic
temperatures. In addition, the collagen-like peptides comprising the vesicle’s outer ‘shell’ can target denatured
collagens, allowing accumulation in tissues with elevated collagen damage/remodeling.
In this proposal, we will evaluate the loading of candidate PTOA disease-modifying drugs (with a focus on
dexamethasone (Dex)) in refined elastin-collagen nano-vesicles (ECnV) and monitor their stability, as well as
passive and hypothermally-triggered drug release. Studies on naïve and ‘injured/activated’ chondrocytes,
synovial fibroblasts, and monocyte/macrophages, and articular cartilage and synovial tissue explants, will
confirm the cyto-/biocompatibility and quantify the suppression of ‘injury’ markers by Dex-loaded ECnVs. We
will conduct in vivo experiments using a non-invasive repeated joint loading (overuse) model of PTOA to
demonstrate the selective retention of ECnVs within injured joints after intra-articular (i.a.) injection. Multi-scale
in vivo, in situ, and histological/immunohistochemical analyses will be employed to evaluate the
pharmacokinetics of passively and hypothermally-triggered cargo release, tissue localization/biodistribution,
and the local and systemic biocompatibility/safety of ECnVs delivered to both healthy and early-PTOA joints.
Finally, we will characterize the ability of ECnV-based delivery of Dex to improve disease-modifying physiology
and PTOA outcomes prophylactically in the aforementioned non-invasive, joint injury model, with standard i.a.
liposomal and free-Dex treatments serving as comparators. Although the proposed work focuses on increasing
PTOA therapy effectiveness, it will also lay a foundation for the use of collagen-targeting ECnV drug carriers
across a broad range of diseases and pathologies characterized by aberrant collagen remodeling."

Melanosome pH controls pigmentation and affects skin cancer risk; however, the signaling pathways that affect
this important pigment mechanism are poorly understood. The Melanocortin 1 Receptor (MC1R), through
transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (tmAC)-defined cAMP signaling pathways, has an important role in
pigmentation, and affects skin cancer risk by activating the expression of key pigment synthesizing enzymes.
But whether MC1R signaling affects melanosome pH has remained unclear. We recently identified a new
cAMP signaling pathway in melanocytes, defined by the soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), that regulates
melanosome pH. Whereas elevation of tmAC-dependent cAMP increases eumelanin by upregulating key
pigment enzymes (e.g., tyrosinase), a reduction in sAC-dependent cAMP also increases eumelanin by
inducing the alkalization of melanosome pH and enhancing tyrosinase activity. Thus, our overarching
hypothesis is that sAC and tmACs regulate distinct cAMP signaling cascades in melanocytes and function in
concert to control pigmentation. What remains unclear are the upstream and downstream mechanisms that
control sAC-dependent regulation of melanosome pH and pigmentation. In our first Aim, we will use human
primary melanocytes expressing either wild type MC1R or MC1R polymorphisms along with Mc1re mouse
melanocytes and a novel Mc1re (e/e) conditional sAC knockout mouse to determine the interplay between
MC1R signaling and sAC-dependent control of melanosome pH and pigmentation. In our first Aim, we will also
assess whether bicarbonate, a known stimulator of sAC that has been linked to melanin synthesis, affects
melanosome pH and pigmentation in human and mouse melanocytes in a sAC-dependent manner. In Aim 2,
we will determine how sAC regulates melanosome pH and pigmentation. Our preliminary data suggests that
sAC activates the cAMP effector protein exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC), which then stimulates
the melanosome ion channel two-pore channel 2 (TPC2). Using genetic and pharmacological methods in
mouse and human melanocytes, we will establish which EPAC isoforms and melanosome channels are
required for sAC-dependent control of melanosome pH. Finally, our preliminary data suggest that sAC
inhibition rescues the defective melanosome pH and tyrosinase activity in Oca2 deleted mouse melanocytes
both in vitro and in mice. Thus, pharmacological sAC inhibitors are potential therapeutics for oculocutaneous
albinism type 2. We will further explore this therapeutic possibility with a new conditional sAC knockout Oca2-/-
(p/p) mouse model. Overall, the experiments in this proposal will systemically examine the cAMP dependent
signaling cascades that regulate melanosome pH and pigmentation. The proposed studies will establish new
models that will overcome limitations in our investigation of cAMP signaling in pigmentation, will provide
greater insight into the cAMP-dependent mechanisms that control melanosome pH, and may lead to new
therapeutics for diseases of pigmentation."

 Peripheral artery disease, more prevalent than coronary heart disease or stroke, is often ignored. The
disease is increasing with the aging of the population and the epidemic of diabetes, but therapeutic options are
limited. Unlike coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease is not consistently associated with risk factors
such as lipoproteins and hypertension, and it appears to be more prevalent and more clinically aggressive in
women as compared to men.
 Chronic vessel immaturity characterizes peripheral artery disease. Fatty acid metabolism impacts
remodeling of the vasculature, and the fatty acid palmitate has pleiotropic functions that include protein
lipidation. Successive cycles of palmitoylation followed by depalmitoylation are critical for membrane trafficking.
We generated a mouse with deficient endothelial acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1), the dominant enzyme for
reversing protein palmitoylation. This animal is a model for human peripheral artery disease. Palmitoylated R-
Ras, caused by APT1 deficiency, accumulates in the vasculature of these animals, and expression of an R-
Ras molecule engineered to restore intracellular trafficking rescues physiologic defects. Decreased APT1
enzyme activity and increased palmitoylated R-Ras are found in diabetes models.
 Lower extremity arteries from humans with diabetes and peripheral artery disease have a significantly
greater content of palmitoylated R-Ras (reflecting impaired APT1 activity) compared to arteries from control
nondiabetic humans with no vascular disease. APT1 appears to have a disproportionate effect in female as
compared to male mice, and vascular tissue from human females with peripheral artery disease has
significantly greater content of palmitoylated R-Ras (reflecting decreased APT1 activity) as compared to
vessels from human males with peripheral artery disease. To pursue these observations, we will test the
hypothesis that deficiency of the depalmitoylation enzyme acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1) promotes
peripheral artery disease. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine if increasing APT1 enzyme activity by
pharmacologic and genetic approaches decreases peripheral artery disease in mice. 2) To determine if sex
specific effects on APT1 enzyme activity and its downstream target R-Ras contribute to increased peripheral
artery disease in mice. 3) To translate this work to humans by determining if the consequences of decreased
APT1 enzyme activity, the accumulation of palmitoylated R-Ras and altered fibronectin processing, are
reflected in arteries from women and men with peripheral artery disease.
 Achieving these aims has the potential to identify a novel target for a neglected disease, and to provide
insight into how sex and diabetes affect peripheral artery disease."
10844531,"K23 Abstract
DESCRIPTION: Nearly one third of individuals with substance use disorders are women of
childbearing age. Life-threatening infant complications from maternal opioid use disorders
(OUD) include neonatal withdrawal syndrome, acute and chronic developmental and behavioral
challenges, increased risks of infection through maternal transmission (i.e. HIV, Syphilis), and
death. Mothers with OUD must negotiate micro and macro level challenges that impact
parenting and recovery management, including reluctance to disclose drug use for fear of legal
issues, child custody and domestic disputes, stigma, financial, and transportation barriers.
There are few proven interventions that support long-term recovery management and parenting
for addicted new mothers embedded within this unique context. Using a community based
participatory research (CBPR) approach, we will determine the feasibility and preliminary effects
of a customized evidence-based digital technology self-management recovery program for
women with OUD during the pregnancy and postpartum period. Based on our preliminary data,
our central hypothesis is that once tailored strategies are identified by primary stakeholders, an
evidence-based program that uses digital technology can be delivered to pregnant and
parenting women with OUD to expand accessibility to evidence-based parenting and recovery
resources. The specific aims of this study include: (1) Customize eRecovery technology
integrating preferred parenting resources and recovery supports in collaboration with a
community advisory board (CAB) and new mothers in early recovery from substance use
disorders; (2) Evaluate the feasibility of using the customized eRecovery technology for
pregnant and postpartum women in early recovery from OUD to determine use and usefulness
based on participant perceptions, engagement and retention in care, drug abstinence, and
parenting outcomes. The results from this proof-of-concept study will provide strong pilot data to
guide development of a full-scale trial in a future RO1 application in Year 4 of this award. The
career development award will provide Dr. Raynor the mentoring and training needed to
develop knowledge and skills in rural health disparities, CBPR methods, digital intervention
development and program evaluation, population health interventions and advanced research
training. At the close of the award, she will be positioned to design, implement, and evaluate
research that will significantly improve the health outcomes of pregnant and parenting women
with OUD and their vulnerable newborn infants living in a rural Southeastern state."
10818412,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Defining genetic variation responsible for neuromuscular phenotypes has provide insight about basic
neurological mechanisms as well as insight on human disease mechanisms. Mouse models have also been
used to understand genetic mechanisms that cause relevant neurological conditions. These discoveries were
made through the classic genetic approach of characterizing a phenotype and then defining the genotype that
accounts for that defect. This approach has been instrumental for a host of discoveries resulting in a more
thorough understanding of underlying mechanisms of disease. The project put forth under this proposal follows
a similar approach. We seek to identify and characterize a potentially novel variant responsible for a severe,
“novel ataxia phenotype” (nap) discovered in our lab with the ultimate goal of shedding light on novel
mechanisms underlying ataxia. This proposal outlines experiments to characterize the affected tissue type and
evaluate whole genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA sequencing to isolate potentially causal genetic variants
to experimentally validate. This approach ensures that progress is not wholly dependent on a specific result,
rather several experiments can be done in concert that will increase the probability of success. Our approach
of utilizing WGS will providing the genetic landscape thereby elucidating potential noncoding variants that may
elicit the phenotype in the nap mice. After determining which tissue type is affected, we will perform RNA
sequencing to elucidate transcriptomic differences in the nap mice to provide potential mechanisms underlying
the phenotype. Successfully identifying the variant through computationally analysis and experimental
validation will allow for further experiments to better understand the mechanism of action of the variant, as
outlined in the aims. Given the presentation of the ataxia phenotype, we suspect the primary tissue affected
will be the cerebellum and/or brainstem and through breeding, we have established that this variant is inherited
in an autosomal recessive pattern. Through preliminary genome analysis, we have identified several novel
candidates and excluded several known genes responsible for ataxia phenotypes. The results of this project
are expected to provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie ataxia and will potentially
serve as a model for therapeutic development to ameliorate ataxia symptomology. This project was designed
to expand the skills and training of the principal investigator with the goal of comprehensive training in
bioinformatics and characterization of the mouse model."
10754967,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project will develop volumetric real-time magnetic resonance imaging (RT-MRI) technology on a novel 0.55
Tesla platform to provide improved assessment of the heart and airway in motion. Rationale: Volumetric real-
time imaging by computed tomography and ultrasound have had a profound impact on our ability to understand
and evaluate disorders involving movement and of moving organs. These modalities each have limitations that
include ionizing radiation, obstructed visualization angles, and limited contrast. MRI is currently capable of slice-
by-slice RT-MRI and a leap to volumetric would enable improved assessment of a wide range of heart and airway
disorders. Innovation: NIH has developed a 0.55 Tesla MRI instrument, that we argue will enable a breakthrough
in RT-MRI performance. This is due to substantially reduced off-resonance effects, substantially reduced tissue
heating, and a leap in scan efficiency due to increased flexibility in the MRI pulse sequence. We propose an
innovative intramural-extramural partnership and interdisciplinary team to explore this potential. Approach: The
objective of this project is to develop and translate low-latency volumetric RT-MRI methods that provide
unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution and spatial coverage and will benefit several heart and airway
applications. Specifically, we will: 1- develop and technically validate volumetric RT-MRI data acquisition at the
0.55T field strength, 2- develop and technically validate low-latency volumetric RT-MRI reconstruction, artifact
mitigation, and segmentation, and 3- clinically evaluate volumetric RT-MRI in two unique patient cohorts at the
NIH Clinical Center where it is likely to make an immediate impact on care—patients with tracheomalacia and
relapsing polychondritis (N=20), and patients undergoing MRI-guided invasive cardiac catheterization (N=20).
Broader Impact: The proposed volumetric RT-MRI technology is generalizable and could benefit many additional
applications, such as cardiac function assessment in arrhythmia, and upper airway assessment in obstructive
sleep apnea. The intramural and extramural labs each offer unique and complementary expertise to achieve this
ambitious technical development. Creation of this new intramural-extramural collaboration will benefit both
research programs and lead to new synergies that include basic research, clinical translation, and training of the
next generation of scientists and engineers."
10884998,"This is a 5-year renewal application to support 5 postdoctoral trainees for a broad Training Program in Academic
Endocrinology. This program has been in place at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School
since 1985 and has been highly successful in training physician-scientists and basic scientists, many of whom
remain in academic endocrinology. In the last 15-year period, 80% of the 30 trainees who have completed their
training remain in a research career. The faculty combines both physician-scientists of the Endocrinology
Division with those basic scientists of the Harvard Medical School faculty whose research is significantly related
to endocrinology and who have a past and current history of collaborative interactions with Program faculty
members in the Endocrinology Division. These 23 faculty members have collectively trained 475 postdoctoral
fellows, the great majority of whom remain in research-related careers, either in academic positions or in industry.
The 5 trainees appointed each year will be individuals with MD, PhD, or MD/PhD degrees and they will undertake
3-4 years of an intensive research experience with an emphasis on translational investigation. The goal of the
program is to provide structured and mentored training experiences to afford trainees with sufficient expertise to
apply successfully for mentored research awards, such as K23, K08, K01 or K99 awards, or independent
research grants such as R01 grants, to ultimately develop into translational endocrine investigators who will
address the great needs for research into endocrine and metabolic disorders that are so prevalent and cause
such great morbidity in our society. The diverse areas of research interest of the faculty span endocrine science
from the molecular and cellular levels to whole animal, patient-oriented and population levels, encompassing
regulation of energy expenditure, insulin signaling, mechanisms of steroid and thyroid hormone action,
neuroendocrinology, the control of skeletal muscle development, differentiation, and repair, and the epidemiology
of diabetes, obesity, and vitamin D deficiency disorders. There is a strong emphasis on genetics, epigenetics,
and new technologies for translating science into therapeutics. Individuals in this program will be trained to
translate the insights they gain to develop strategies for the treatment and prevention of common endocrinology-
based public health problems, including diabetes, obesity and osteoporosis."
10831412,"SUMMARY
Sepsis remains a persistent and pervasive public health problem and clinical trials for evaluating specific
therapies for sepsis have not been successful. Therefore, there is an immediate need to broaden our
knowledge that can result in better treatment strategies. Multiple organ damage, including Acute Lung
Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), in sepsis is caused by dysregulated host
response to bacterial infection and the innate immunity provides critical and early protection against
infection. Although vigorous recruitment of neutrophils (PMN) to tissues is a key innate immune
mechanism, excessive influx can induce collateral damage. PMN are produced in the hematopoietic
compartment during infection via emergency granulopoiesis to clear bacterial pathogens. Innate immune
recognition of bacteria occurs through membrane-bound toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosolic NOD-like
receptors (NLRs). One type of NLR is the inflammasomes, a multiprotein platform that can activate
caspase-1 in order to activate cytokines IL-1 and IL-18. The long-term goal of our proposed work is to
understand how inflammasome activation is integrated into effective antimicrobial resistance and if it is
possible to mitigate organ damage during this response. In this context, host targeted therapies are
warranted because of the emergence of drug-resistant and hypervirulent bacterial strains. We primarily
focus on peritoneum as the site of infection and lung as the affected organ systemic infection. We use E.
coli for in vitro experiments because of its importance in Gram-negative bacterial sepsis. The hypothesis
is that NLRP10 activation is a critical determinant of host defense during sepsis-induced systemic
infection. Four aims have been proposed to address the hypothesis: Aim 1 will evaluate the effects of
NLRP10 on host defense, Aim 2 will elucidate the role of NLRP10 in emergency granulopoiesis, Aim 3
will characterize the role of NLRP10 in macrophages, and Aim 4 will examine whether enhancing
NLRP10 signaling improves lung immunity. A combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches will be used.
The findings in these aims will unveil a new molecular model of innate immunity relating to the role of the
NLRP10 in sepsis and will foster the identification of novel therapeutic targets that enhance bacterial
clearance and restores the integrity of the injured organs in sepsis-induced systemic infection."

Studies of the molecular physiology and genetics of body weight regulation are increasingly dependent upon
highly sensitive and accurate measurements of energy expenditure, body composition, adipose tissue biology,
ingestive behaviors and brain imaging, as are the analyses of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. Hence,
the current Human Phenotyping Core (HPC) and affiliated laboratories are critical resources in the NYNORC’s
(and NIH’s) commitment to advance understanding of the pathogenesis of obesity. The combined HPC
resources are unique to the NYNORC, and the laboratories attract students and visiting scientists at all levels
from around the world. The use of the HPC laboratory by Members/Users continues to grow. The HPC has
provided consultative advice to investigators including the long-term behavioral lifestyle intervention clinical trials
in obesity/type 2 diabetes (X. Pi-Sunyer) on phenotypes to be measured and the interpretation of these tests,
including long-term longitudinal multi-center trials. The HPC has a large training function and is, therefore, highly
responsive to the needs of Members and enables greater productivity at lower cost for them. The Research Base
includes a large group of federally funded investigators who require the methodologies offered in the HPC to
conduct their studies. The facilities including a new 3-whole room calorimeter suite, and services provided by
this Core are unique and not available commercially or to the individual Core users by virtue of equipment costs
and necessary technical/analytic expertise. During the current cycle, 32 member investigators - with
support from 31 NIH, 2 AHA, 8 training/K grants, and 2 NYNORC Pilot & Feasibility awards - submitted
>8000 Core service requests, which were met, contributing to 117 peer-reviewed publications and the
generation of 21 new or renewed grants. The overall objective of the HPC is to enhance and expand the
research capabilities of investigators performing clinical and translational studies in humans related to obesity
and eating disorders and their related physiological/medical phenotypes. The Specific Aims of the HPC are to:
1) Make available to Center members specialized measurements in human subjects of body composition, energy
expenditure, imaging & analysis, and adipose tissue structure and function; 2) Provide investigators with
consultation/advice in determining which methods are best suited to their needs based on the scientific questions
in the context of budgetary constraints; 3) Provide a setting in which instruction in these technologies and
strategies can be provided to students, postdoctoral research fellows, and interested scientists; 4) Sponsor and
participate in the conduct of periodic seminars on ""state-of-the-art"" body composition, energy expenditure, sleep
physiology, imaging analysis, adipose tissue analysis, with ultimate emphasis on those aspects of greatest
relevance to the problem of human obesity; 5) Provide reduced-cost access to these technologies to NYNORC

PROJECT
SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rodent models of obesity have proven invaluable to the study of obesity and to the work carried out by NYNORC
investigators. To meet the growing needs of Center researchers in the evaluation of multiple molecular and
systemic physiological indices of metabolism in obesity, including inflammation, gene expression, and both
shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis, the proposed NYNORC Animal Phenotyping Core (APC) reflects a
significant expansion of the Animal Energy Balance Core (Einstein) and integration with the animal component
of the Adipose Tissue Core (Columbia). Since our last submission (2015), the APC has processed 10,231 tissue
samples and phenotyped or operated on 4023 mice/rats for 36 NYNORC members supported by 31 grants,
and provided additional services to 5 NIH-funded non-NYNORC members. The services offered by APC have
been instrumental in obtaining 18 new or renewed grants, and in 119 publications. Based on their experiences
with the APC core and ever-increasing data demands of high impact research journals, NYNORC members'
research programs have responded by expanding in their sophistication and desire for multiple spontaneous
measures of metabolism and tissue-targeting approaches in awake behaving animals. Accordingly, new
services requested by 14 existing and new NYNORC members, including continuous blood glucose monitoring,
electromyography, in vivo tissue-specific thermogenesis, and adipose tissue analyses have led to 4 new and 1
renewed R01 grant, and have generated >250 service requests from 17 NYNORC users for more extensive
uses of these services for the next funded period. The proposed APC concentrates and coordinates significantly
expanded technical and research capabilities of this amalgamated Core. The incorporation of additional animal
resources at both the Einstein and Columbia campuses, will significantly increase the user and research base
of the NYNORC overall, and of the APC Core in particular. By coordinated application of NYNORC-dedicated
facilities, and resources and expertise at both Columbia and Einstein, the proposed APC Core combines
sophisticated qualitative and quantitative measurements of ingestive behavior with concurrent assessments of
energy expenditure, physical activity, body temperature, and repeatable noninvasive body composition analysis
by MRI and MicroCT. Also available are a range of metabolic surgeries, including gastrointestinal bypass,
autonomic denervation procedures, and adipose tissue services including: 1) quantifying adipocyte
subpopulations (brown, white, beige), in terms of size, variation, and cellular ultrastructure; 2) primary
cell isolation and analysis; 3) differentiation of adipocytes and adipose tissue macrophages; and 4)
adipose tissue transplantation. This expanded array of services stems from the growing realization that
our understanding of the biology of obesity requires simultaneous assessment of energy intake and
energy expenditure, and of the means to determine their net effects on energy balance repeatedly in
individual animals."

for the past 5 cycles of this grant. The MBMG Core provides critical research support for obesity-related clinical
and basic research activities in the area of molecular genetics, bioinformatics, and model organism
characterization. The services are widely used and have increased the productivity of NYNORC investigators,
while curtailing costs and facilitating access to advanced genomics technologies. The primary objective of this
Core is to assist investigators to apply the tools and technologies of molecular genetics and genomics to
elucidate the molecular-genetic basis for the pathogenesis and medical/physiological co-morbidities of obesity.
The Specific Aims of the MBMG Core are: 1) To facilitate the application of molecular genetics to problems of
obesity by providing expert consultation on both study design and applicable molecular biological techniques; 2)
To provide standard laboratory services to young investigators and those without formal labs for studies related
to obesity; 3) To develop and make available new cutting edge research tools and reagents. To these ends, the
MBMG Core offers consultation and services for molecular methods including gene expression, DNA extraction,
genotyping, DNA and RNA sequencing, bacterial phylogenetic characterization by 16s rRNA, RNAscope,
clearing of tissue by SHIELD reagents, mouse transgenics, stem cell derivation and differentiation, and genome
editing with CRISPR Cas9, and analytic tools related to these techniques. Core services are of 3 basic types: (i)
On-site Direct Services, (ii) Consultative-Collaborative services with Institutional Cores, (iii) Consultative-
Referral. To gain access to cutting-edge technologies, avoid duplication and to maximally leverage our
resources, we collaborate extensively with other local Core facilities and laboratories. Core personnel provide
assistance ranging from study design to execution of studies and data interpretation. We emphasize service to
young investigators and P&F grantees. The Core has been active in developing new research tools and reagents
and has played an essential role in establishing iPS cell technology and optogenetics for our community. Our
R&D activities are focused on developing new tools and reagents for brain research and genetic manipulations
in cells and model animals. The MBMG Core has been a nexus for intellectual exchange and collaboration, and
an important training venue for students, fellows and junior faculty. During the past cycle, the Core processed
over >20,000 samples from 39 NORC members supported by 43 grants, in addition to 10 non-members.
These services helped investigators generate 68 new grants and 107 publications."
10793515,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid use disorder is a public health crisis that stems from the highly addictive nature and potent
analgesic properties of opioids. Opioids modulate circuitry involved in analgesia, pain-induced negative
affect, motivation, reward, and addiction. They act on G-protein coupled opioid receptors, inducing multiple
intracellular signaling pathways. Of these, the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein
kinase A (PKA) pathway is known to be a key mechanism in analgesia, pain-related aversion, and opioid-
induced hyperalgesia. Most studies examining PKA signaling in response to opioids or pain are limited by
in vitro or ex vivo approaches that cannot simultaneously consider cell-type specific PKA signaling,
complex circuit-level regulation, and effects of behavior on PKA dynamics. As a result, it remains unclear
exactly where and when PKA is modulated in response to opioids; nor is it clear what the functional effects
of these spatiotemporal PKA dynamics are on analgesia. Understanding the functional significance of
opioid-induced intracellular signaling and how this signaling differs in unique cell types and brain regions
will allow us to better comprehend how opioids differentially effect pain and addiction circuitry. The goals
of this proposal are as follows: First, I will define the temporal dynamics of mu opioid-induced PKA
signaling within the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) to anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) circuitry. This circuitry
highly expresses mu opioid receptors and integrates sensory and affective pain. Then, I will determine
whether there is a causal relationship between these PKA dynamics and pain relief. Finally, I will examine
the cell-type specificity of these PKA dynamics. My central hypothesis is that PKA dynamics will depend
on the duration of opioid exposure and will determine the extent of pain response, with specific cell types
acting as key sites of PKA modulation. This hypothesis will be tested using a novel genetically encoded
sensor designed for in vivo imaging of PKA activity in behaving mice. To examine regional differences in
temporal PKA dynamics in response to acute and chronic opioid exposure, PKA will be imaged before,
during, and after opioid administration in the MD and ACC. Imaging will be paired with pain assays to
assess analgesia and hyperalgesia. To test the necessity and sufficiency of PKA dynamics in pain relief,
PKA activity will be modulated by either a genetically encoded PKA inhibitor or photoactivatable adenylyl
cyclase while conducting behavioral assays of pain. Finally, to examine the cell-specificity of PKA
dynamics, sensor expression will be isolated to each cell type of interest in a Cre-dependent manner, and
peptide agonists and antagonists of mu opioid receptors will be locally infused during PKA imaging. This
study will define how PKA signaling in specific components of the MD to ACC circuitry both responds to
opioids and mediates pain relief. Achieving these goals will provide insight into how intracellular signaling
is spatiotemporally regulated by opioids and facilitates analgesia."

 This project will conduct the 2021 wave of the Child Development Supplement (CDS) to the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics (PSID). CDS-21 will reinterview children and families who participated in the 2019 wave of
CDS. In 2019, CDS interviews of children's primary caregivers (PCGs, typically mothers) and older children
(ages 12–17 years) were completed for most of the sample in the five months prior to the middle of March
2019, when the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns began to occur in the United States. Our goal is
to collect follow-up CDS interviews in 2021 of PCGs and of older children (ages 12–17 years in 2021) who par-
ticipated in CDS-19, in order to understand the effects of Covid-19 on children's health, family circumstances,
schooling, development, and well-being. CDS is integral and on-going component of PSID, a longitudinal sur-
vey of a nationally representative sample of U.S. families that began in 1968. With data collected on the same
families and their descendants for 41 waves over 52 years (as of 2020), PSID is a cornerstone for empirical
social science research in the U.S. Through its long-term measures of economic and social wellbeing, and
based on its weighted representative sample of U.S. families that now includes two major immigrant refresher
samples, the study has advanced research on the dynamics of social, economic, demographic, and health pro-
cesses and their interrelationships. Five waves of CDS have been conducted: three on the original cohort of
children born between 1985 and 1997 (in 1997, 2002/2003, and 2007/2008) and two waves (in 2014 and
2019) on the next generation of PSID children who were born between 1997 and 2019. This project has two
specific aims. The first is to design and field a follow-up wave of CDS in 2021, collecting reinterview data on
children aged 2–17 years who participated in CDS-19, through interviews with PCGs and older children aged
12–17 years. The second specific aim is to process, document, and distribute the new CDS-21 data, with scale
composites, generated variables, and individual-level links to detailed school data from the National Center for
Education Statistics. This new wave of CDS in 2021 will, in conjunction with data from CDS-14 and CDS-19,
provide unique and valuable prospective panel data to study the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, lockdown,
and recession. The study will provide comprehensive and rich information on a large, nationally representative
sample of children that includes an over-sample of African Americans and a new refresher sample of children
in immigrant families. These data will be available free of charge through the PSID Online Data Center, which
provides customized extracts and codebooks, detailed study documentation, and comprehensive user educa-
tion and support."

Hypertension is an enormous health and socio-economic burden in the United States and is a leading cause of
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide. Overall, 1 in 3 of Americans have hypertension, and nearly 2
in 3 of Americans over the age of 65 years. Hypertension significantly increases the risk of developing heart
failure (HF), whereas reducing blood pressure decreases the risk. It is known that hypertension is the most
common risk factor in the development of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) by a mechanism where
systemic inflammation and activation of reactive oxygen species reduces nitric oxide bioavailability and impairs
Protein kinase G (PKG) signaling. Chronic hypertension is characterized by impaired systolic and diastolic
cardiac function and pathological remodeling, and excessive renal sodium retention and volume overload, which
together contribute to progression to HFpEF and a poor prognosis. Therapies attempting to reduce blood
pressure in HFpEF patients have mostly failed to yield positive results. Many patients have hypertension that is
resistant to conventional therapy, and because the majority of HFpEF patients are elderly, they display aging
inherent deficits in nitric oxide bioavailability and PKG signaling that make available therapies less effective.
Although, it is known that impaired PKG signaling is central to the cardio-renal deficits related to hypertension
especially in older individuals, therapies specifically designed to enhance PKG activity have not been successful.
Our preliminary studies have explored an alternative approach to manipulating PKG levels to improve outcomes
in hypertension and HFpEF by bypassing complex signaling cascades in favor of directly targeting the
downstream effectors of PKG. We have identified a phosphorylatable serine residue 273 (S273) in the regulatory
protein MyBPC as a critical specific downstream target of PKG that is upregulated in various models of pressure
overload-induced hypertension, but is downregulated in models of HFpEF. These observations lay the
foundation for our general hypothesis that increasing S273 phosphorylation levels in chronic Htn prevents
progression to HFpEF. In Aim 1 we will define the PKG-specific in vitro molecular mechanisms of S273
phosphorylation, in Aim 2 we will utilize experimental models of hypertension and HFpEF and novel transgenic
animal models to determine the in vivo functional consequences of altered PKG levels and aging, and in Aim 3
we will utilize in vivo cardioselective AAV9 viral gene delivery of phosphomimetic S273 to prevent or reverse the
HFpEF phenotype in aged mice and in mice with ablated PKG. Successful completion of these mechanistic
studies have the promise to identify S273 as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat hypertension-induced HFpEF,
a devastating disease with no effective treatments."

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and other progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (PF-ILDs) lead to
inexorable lung function decline and death despite available treatments. Patients with PF-ILD can also
experience acute respiratory deteriorations known as acute exacerbations (AE), which carry a high short-term
mortality, lack approved treatments, and are poorly understood. Dr. Swaminathan’s long-term goal is to develop
novel treatments for PF-ILD that improve outcomes and to use biomarkers to personalize therapies in PF-ILD.
The overall objective of this application is to investigate the role of the complement pathway as a biomarker in
PF-ILD disease progression, AE, and as a genetic risk factor for PF-ILD development and progression. The
central hypothesis is that complement activation, as reflected either by C3b, C4b, or C5a protein generation or
genetic variation, associates with PF-ILD progression, AE events, and AE outcomes. The rationale for this project
is that identification of complement activation as a biomarker in PF-ILD progression or AE will identify patients
for whom further intervention with complement-related therapies is warranted, expanding treatment options for
patients with PF-ILD. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims. In Aim 1, plasma
C3b, C4b, and C5a will be quantified in 1,273 PF-ILD patients at baseline and 6 months of follow up to determine
the association with a composite measure of disease progression. Aim 2 will recruit a prospective cohort of PF-
ILD patients with AE (n=50) to determine the association of plasma C3b, C4b, and C5a with 90-day death or
lung transplant and to compare C3b, C4b, and C5a in the plasma and lung tissue of patients with versus without
AE. Aim 3 will leverage existing whole genome sequencing in patients with IPF (n=912) and newly generated
whole exome sequencing in patients with non-IPF PF-ILD (n=400) to identify protein-coding variants in
complement-related genes that confer risk for PF-ILD and associate with PF-ILD progression or AE. By
completing the scientific aims and the career development activities of this proposal, Dr. Swaminathan will
acquire rigorous clinical and translational research training, including in-depth knowledge of complement biology.
Her career development activities will also build new expertise in these areas through graduate-level didactics
in immunology and biostatistics, complement-focused conferences, laboratory externships, experiential training
in clinical trials at the Duke Clinical Research Institute, and carefully mentored hands-on research experiences.
Dr. Swaminathan’s research and career development will be guided by a multidisciplinary mentorship team with
expertise in IPF, complement biology, translational pulmonary research, and biostatistics. Her scientific advisors
will add further depth in complement activation, genetics, and pulmonary fibrosis mechanisms. The research
training, along with strong institutional support, will accelerate Dr. Swaminathan’s transition to an independently-
funded investigator to conduct trials evaluating complement-related therapies in patients with PF-ILD targeted in
a personalized manner."
10738806,"Summary/Abstract
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD), one of the most prevalent degenerative diseases, is characterized by
the prevalence of senile plaques that consist of fibrils of amyloid b (Ab). In the amyloidogenic pathway,
sequential proteolysis of the b-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by b and g secretases generate Ab (40-
42 amino acid) peptides. Ab multimerizes into neurotoxic oligomers that target the synapse, leading to
disruption of long-term potentiation, cell death, and memory loss. Alternatively, in the non-amyloidogenic
pathway, APP is cleaved sequentially by a and g secretase to generate sAPPa that exhibits
neuroprotective properties and precludes the formation of Ab. Studies have identified ADAM10, a
member of the adamlysin family of zinc metalloproteinases, as the constitutive a-secretase in neurons.
Activation of ADAM10 is currently being evaluated as a means of therapeutic intervention. However, this
strategy has severe disadvantages: ADAM10 is known to cleave multiple substrates and is upregulated
in a wide range of malignancies. A non-specific (non-selective) up-regulation/enhancement of ADAM10
as a means of therapeutic intervention in AD would likely have deleterious side effects. The importance
of the non-catalytic (disintegrin and cysteine rich) domains of ADAM10 in substrate recognition was
shown previously. A conformation specific mAb, 8C7, which recognizes an active conformation of
ADAM10 found on tumor cells was developed. Importantly, while 8C7 selectively enhances APP
cleavage in cell-based assay, it inhibits Notch-Delta and Eph-ephrin oncogenic signaling in preclinical
models, without any discernible toxicity effects in mice, thereby ruling out deleterious side effects that
might result from its potential use as AD therapeutic. The proposed studies will characterize the
ADAM10-APP interactions in vitro to better understand how the ADAM10 a-secretase interacts with and
cleaves APP. The molecular mechanism of action of the 8C7 mAb in promoting this cleavage will also
be investigated. A human version of the anti-ADAM10 mAb 8C7, named 1H5, that augments cleavage
of peptide substrates and binds to the substrate binding domain of ADAM10, was generated recently.
Similar to 8C7, this human mAb (1H5), as well as a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from it,
will now be evaluated in cell-based assays in order to determine their efficacies in promoting APP
cleavage. The shedding of APP will further be examined in rat neuronal and human glioblastoma cell
lines in the presence of the mAbs (8C7 and 1H5) and the scFv. This proposal, to enhance the non-
amyloidogenic pathway with anti-ADAM10 mAbs towards the development of novel AD treatments,
serves as a proof of principle of therapeutic potential."

The malaria control program on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea was among the vanguard of
highly intensive and highly successful malaria control programs in sub-Saharan Africa. Intensive
malaria control began in 2004 under the Bioko Island Malaria Control Program (BIMEP)
manages commodity distribution, surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation to eliminate malaria
from Bioko Island. After initial success, the program has documented slower progress, and
malaria persists through residual local transmission by vectors and frequent travel to mainland
Equatorial Guinea resulting in malaria importation. There is a significant need to develop a
methodology that would allow BIMEP to improve malaria control through spatial targeting and
rapid development of an evidence base to reduce residual transmission and guide elimination
efforts across transmission contexts. A practical solution, called adaptive vector control, that
combines elements of integrated vector control and adaptive management. The overall goal of
this proposal is to develop adaptive vector control as a rigorous and quantitative methodology to
help programs understand residual transmission, build an evidence base, and identify strategies
to suppress residual transmission and eliminate malaria. The specific goals of adaptive vector
control are to quantify residual transmission in the urban setting of Malabo, Bioko Island the
capital of Equatorial Guinea, where 90% of the residents of Bioko Island live, and use that
evidence to guide vector control through an iterative, structured policy process. We will use
existing evidence from surveillance, monitoring and evaluation to develop, validate, and analyze
dynamic models of mosquito aquatic habitats, mosquito population dynamics, and malaria
transmission in the city. We will use the models to design adaptive sampling and adaptive
studies to reduce uncertainty about programmatic decisions, and through simulation-based
analytics, we will help the program to improve spatial targeting of indoor residual spraying and
larval source management. Finally, we will use the methods to build an evidence base to
support enhanced vector control with novel vector-based interventions to help BIMEP eliminate
malaria. The challenges of reducing malaria incidence in Malabo and on Bioko Island are similar
to the challenges faced elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, and adaptive vector control is one
way of addressing the problems of urban vector control in the African context."

 Most U.S. adults (77%) take dietary supplements (DS) and 87% of them express overall confidence in the
safety, quality and efficacy of DS. However, DS are not always safe. DS information is scattered in biomedical
literature, social media, and FDA spontaneous reporting system. Thus, to optimize the proper and safe use of
DS, there remains a critical need to develop informatics framework with innovative tools and resources to enable
us better understand efficacy and safety of DS through multimodal data sources. Built upon our prior project, the
objective of this renewal application is to create an enriched DS knowledge base (eDISK) and to develop a
translational informatics framework (iDISK-Mine) with innovative informatics approaches to facility DS research
using real-world, multi-site EHR data and. We will expand our prior work in two major aspects: (1) Expand our
scope to both efficacy and safety (focus of the prior project) of DS using multimodal data sources to enrich our
current DS knowledge base (i.e., eDISK); and (2) Develop and evaluate a translational informatics framework to
facilitate DS research using multi-site real world EHR data. We propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Create
eDISK by integrating DS efficacy and safety from multimodal data sources; (2) Develop a translational
informatics framework (iDISK-Mine) to facilitate EHR-based observational DS research; and (3) Evaluate the
generalizability and utility of iDISK-Mine on the multi-site EHR data of depression patients. This is the first project
to develop a translational informatics framework to advance our DS knowledge using multimodal data sources
and enable us to understand how patients (e.g., depression patients) use DS using the real-world EHR data.
The successful accomplishment of this project will deliver a novel framework with valuable tools and resources
for DS clinical and translational research."

The prevalence of Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has doubled in the past 10 years to ~3 million patients
worldwide. It has a prognosis worse than for many cancers, and, if untreated, has a median survival of 3–5 years.
While IPF has no cure, newly available medications can slow the rate lung function decline by ~50% relative to
placebo, albeit at a cost of $100,000 per year, and with unknown efficacy in individual patients. Today, IPF
clinical care and research are stymied by a lack of tools that can reliably assess its heterogeneous regional
functional impairment to detect disease and provide robust indicators of positive therapeutic response. To this
end, we have developed hyperpolarized (HP) 129Xe MRI and shown it to provide rapid, non-invasive, 3D
functional assessment of inhaled gas distribution in the airspaces, as well as its uptake in the interstitium (barrier
tissues) and transfer to the capillary red blood cells (RBCs). We have demonstrated its sensitivity to micron-
scale thickening of the interstitial barrier and that this provides a sensitive and early marker of therapeutic
response. This has led to demands for wider dissemination and harmonized acquisition and quantification
protocols that maximize repeatability. Our long-term goal is to broadly disseminate a comprehensive, yet rapid
(15 min), non-invasive, robust, and sensitive MRI exam for fibrotic lung disease. We bring advanced HP 129Xe
MR acquisition and analysis techniques and a track-record of thoracic MRI expertise from three pioneering
centers that have developed this application. The objective of this renewal is to optimize sensitivity to changing
disease, maximize repeatability, harmonize acquisition and analysis and establish its physiological and clinical
interpretation. Our central hypothesis is that this these methods will enable confident detection of treatable
disease and visualize therapeutic response within 3 months of initiation. The rationale for the proposed research
is driven by strong interest from both industry and academic partners, and impending FDA approval for 129Xe
ventilation MRI that will accelerate adoption. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH Mission of
improving health by developing and accelerating the application of biomedical technologies. Our approach is
based on three Specific Aims: 1) Establish optimal repeatability of 129Xe metrics across MRI platforms, 2)
Establish harmonized quantitative analysis, and 3) Deploy and validate a framework to identify active fibrosis
and therapy response. Completion of these aims will 1) make available standardized protocols across scanner
platforms, 2) establish standards that maximize repeatability, and 3) provide the tools and framework needed to
incorporate 129Xe MRI into multi-center trials for progressive fibrosis and ultimately, clinical care. The proposed
approach is innovative because it is built on a fundamentally new approach to probe the functioning of the
alveolar-capillary interface. It is significant because it will enable widespread adoption of methods to advance
our understanding of fibrotic lung disease, accelerate testing of novel therapies, and improve patient care."
10766267,"PROGRAM SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Poor T cell mediated immunity in the elderly is associated with increased morbidity and mortality from
infectious diseases, suboptimal cancer immunity, and poor responses to vaccination. Waning T cell immunity is
due in part to changes in thymic function beginning in the first decade of life and progressing to thymic
involution in early to middle adulthood. However, how stromal-immune crosstalk maintains a differentiated,
organized, and functional thymic stromal environment during early life, changes during thymic aging, and
modifies naïve T cell character is poorly understood. Dr. Corey Miller’s career focus is to understand the
mechanisms underlying medullary thymic function and dysfunction, including during aging, and how these
states shape naïve T cell development, with the goal of informing novel immunorestorative therapies.
His interest in stromal-immune crosstalk started during his doctoral research as an MD/PhD trainee, where he
investigated peripheral sources of the T cell survival cytokine, IL-7. After completing medical school, he chose
to forgo residency in favor of postdoctoral training and has focused on epithelial heterogeneity within the
thymic medulla, leading to a first author publication in Nature. Dr. Miller’s pursuit of further career development
training is based on his desire to leverage his expertise in stromal-immune crosstalk to transition towards a
systems approach to understanding thymic homeostasis and naïve T cell development across life.
This research proposal focuses on a surprising role for the thymic epithelium in expressing a
hematopoietically-restricted cytokine to establish, polarize, and support the medullary stromal environment.
Our preliminary data reveal the thymic epithelium as an unexpected source of IL-13. Using a mouse model in
which IL-13 is selectively deleted from thymic epithelium, we propose aims to dissect its effects on epithelium
and mesenchyme, myeloid cells, and, indirectly, naïve T cell character—thereby establishing a framework for
understanding how changes in the medullary environment shape naïve T cell character.
Dr. Miller has proposed a 5-year career development plan during which he will have direct mentorship by
Dr. Mark Anderson and his advisory committee, which includes a carefully curated group of scientific leaders
with expertise in T cell biology, type 2 cytokines, and aging biology. His proposed coursework, conference
attendance and workshops will enable him to achieve new technical expertise and expand his knowledge base
and scientific network in the field of aging biology. This training period will be spent at UCSF, which is an
unrivaled institutional environment for basic immunology and scientific career development. In addition,
proximity to the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and engagement of Buck CEO, Eric Verdin, as a mentor
will ensure Dr. Miller’s scientific and professional growth within the aging biology community.
At the completion of this career development award, Dr. Miller will have cultivated the technical skills and
domain-specific expertise to launch an independent research program in thymic homeostasis and aging."
10814762,"Project Summary
Background: Malignant melanoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) typically spread to lymph
nodes (LNs) prior to outgrowth in distant tissues. While metastasis to LNs is frequently attributed to passive
drainage from tumor lymphatics, the mechanisms enabling LN metastasis and its functional role in tumor
progression remain poorly understood. LNs are education hubs of the adaptive immune response and harbor
the majority of potentially tumor-reactive lymphocytes. Recently, we discovered that in colonizing LNs, tumor
cells induce tumor-specific immune tolerance through their interactions with leukocytes that subsequently
circulate throughout the host, resulting in systemic tolerance that facilitates metastatic seeding of distant sites.
Hypothesis and objective: We hypothesize that by targeting the induction of immune tolerance in LNs,
we can both prevent distant metastasis and induce tumor regression. We will use multiple cutting-edge
methods to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms of LN tolerance induction and develop approaches
for breaking it. These goals will be pursued in the following aims:
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Identify the mechanisms by which lymph node metastases induce tumor-specific
immune tolerance through their activation of immunosuppressive lymphocyte populations. Aim 2: Determine
the role of epigenetic regulation in LN metastasis and tolerance induction. Aim 3: Investigate
immunotherapeutic approaches targeting tumor immune tolerance in LNs.
Study design and methods: Using high-content multiplexed microscopy, mass cytometry, photoconversion-
based lineage tracing, TCR sequencing, and genetic mouse models of antigen presentation, we will dissect the
cellular interactions in LNs that we hypothesize are responsible for tolerance induction and dissemination, and
validate the findings in human tissues and datasets. LN metastatic tumor cells exhibit conserved and stable
transcriptional profiles indicative of epigenetic reprogramming. We will assess the role of epigenetic alterations
in conferring a pro-LN metastatic transcriptional signature using bisulfite sequencing and ATAC-seq, and
employ T-ATAC-seq to elucidate changes in the epigenetic landscape within tolerized T cells that recognize
tumor antigens. We will evaluate the ability of our novel immunostimulatory antibody conjugates, targeted
specifically to LNs, to reprogram APCs in metastatic LNs, employ HDAC inhibitors to reprogram both malignant
and lymphocyte populations away from tumor immune tolerance, and combine these strategies to elicit robust
anti-tumor combination therapies in mouse models of melanoma and PDAC.
Expected results and impact: Upon successful conclusion of this work, we will have identified the
mechanisms by which LN metastasis induces systemic tolerance, and evaluated novel immunotherapeutic
strategies to overcome these mechanisms."

This application for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is submitted by Katsiaryna Bykov,
PharmD, ScD, in response to PA-20-190. Dr. Bykov is an Associate Epidemiologist and Instructor in Medicine
in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and
Harvard Medical School. Her long-term goal is to generate clinically actionable evidence to guide the safe and
effective use of medications in older adults in the complex milieu of polypharmacy and multimorbidity. Her recent
research has focused on developing innovative methods for the detection and evaluation of drug-drug
interactions and their clinical impact using electronic healthcare data. Dr. Bykov aims to acquire expertise in
clinical geriatrics and diabetology, geriatric pharmacoepidemiology, and advanced statistical methods for data
mining and signal detection to translate her methodological work into clinically relevant research. To achieve her
aims, Dr. Bykov proposes a 5-year program of career development and mentored research centered on the
development of a valid and efficient system for the detection and evaluation of drug-drug interactions in
older adults with diabetes. Within the highly productive and supportive research environment of the Division
of Pharmacoepidemiology, Dr. Bykov will work with an interdisciplinary team of mentors and collaborators drawn
from across institutions at Harvard and University of Pennsylvania who have deep expertise and
national/international reputations in the specific substantive areas of her proposed training: clinical geriatrics and
diabetology, advanced statistical methods for data mining and signal detection, drug-drug interactions research,
and pharmacoepidemiology. The overarching objective of the proposal is to develop a framework for the
detection and evaluation of clinically relevant drug-drug interactions in older adults with diabetes. Dr. Bykov
proposes a novel 2-stage screening that will identify potentially interacting drugs in electronic healthcare data
and will be followed by a rigorous hypothesis-driven evaluation of identified interactions. The approach will use
Medicare claims data, available in the Division and linked to electronic health records and outpatient laboratory
test results for a subset of patients, and will be specifically tailored to address the heterogeneity and complexity
of health status in older adults, including varying degrees of frailty and multimorbidity. The proposed work will
provide high quality and clinically relevant evidence that will help older adults with diabetes and their clinicians
to more fully assess the benefits and risks of adding a new medication in the presence of other medications and
co-morbidities. The knowledge gained from this work will impact several million older adults with diabetes in
the US and will provide the applicant with a solid background to become an independent investigator and,
ultimately, a leader in the study of medication use and outcomes in aging populations."
10772167,"Despite increased survival,1 over two-thirds of children with cancer experience late effects, such as
secondary cancers, sensorimotor deficits, and neurocognitive impairment.2,3 Psychosocial late effects,
particularly social isolation and victimization, difficulties forming and maintaining friendships, and emotional
distress, are common for survivors of central nervous system (CNS) disease or those who receive CNS-
directed therapy (e.g., cranial radiation, intrathecal chemotherapy).4-6 Unfortunately, interventions to improve
outcomes have had limited success.7,8 So why don’t childhood cancer survivors have friends and feel happy?
Our model posits that residual deficits in social cognition contribute to negative peer interactions and poor
psychosocial outcomes in children with brain injury.10,11 However, most work has focused on adult survivors of
pediatric cancer and not children diagnosed early in life (preschool). These young survivors may be at greatest
risk for difficulties for several reasons. First, the peak onset of the most common pediatric cancers occurs
before age 6.1 Second, their treatments have an especially harmful impact on brain development and a high
rate of sensorimotor deficits.2,3 Third, children are treated up to 3 years and isolated at a critical time for social
development. Fourth, parents are at risk for distress, which may impair their ability to buffer negative effects on
their children.17,18 Thus, there is an urgent need to characterize psychosocial risk in children treated for early
onset cancer and to evaluate the utility of our model to inform more effective, targeted interventions. Our long-
term goal is to reduce morbidity and improve the well-being of children with cancer. The objective of this
controlled, multi-site study is to identify predictors of friendships and emotional distress in young cancer
survivors (i.e., diagnosed < age 6, >1 year off treatment). Using a rigorous matched control design, we will
assess peer interactions and friendships in the elementary classrooms (i.e., grades 3-5) of 200 survivors.
Individual and family functioning will be assessed during home visits with families of survivors and 200
matched classmates. We will identify deficits in social cognition and peer interactions, as well as environmental
resources (e.g., parenting, school climate), that predict long-term psychosocial adjustment (i.e., friendships,
distress). The rationale is that deficits in social cognition and peer interactions contribute to psychosocial risk,
which could be mitigated by resources in the school and family environments. Aim 1. Compare the long-term
psychosocial adjustment of young survivors to matched peers and identify group differences in social cognition
and peer interactions that may predict poor adjustment. Aim 2. Identify specific social cognitive and peer
interaction factors that account for psychosocial adjustment in young survivors. Aim 3. Identify environmental
resources that protect psychosocial adjustment in young survivors. This research is significant as it will
delineate early risk and protective factors that predict long-term adaptation for young survivors and leave us in
a prime position to develop interventions that will improve survivorship care and prevent long-term morbidity."
10817148,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the United States, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infects more than half the adult population and is the
leading cause of viral encephalitis and infectious blindness. Yet, the host factors contributing to the most
severe manifestations of HSV-1 remain unclear. Inflammasomes, a recently discovered antiviral innate
immune defense, and the production of two inflammasome cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1and IL-18) are critical
in HSV-1 control and pathogenesis. However, how inflammasomes are regulated during HSV-1 infection is
poorly understood. Recently, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has emerged as a possible regulator of
inflammasome signaling. LRRK2 has been studied extensively because specific alleles are associated with
Parkinson’s disease, Crohn’s disease, cancer, and leprosy. Despite the disease associations, the precise
function of LRRK2 and how it mediates disease are unknown. Evidence for a role in the immune response
include that LRRK2 is highly expressed on immune cells, is upregulated in response to infection, and was
recently shown to modulate the NLRC4 inflammasome in response to bacterial infection. We recently
demonstrated that NLRP3 is critical in inflammasome activation by HSV-1, and our preliminary data indicate
that LRRK2 enhances NLRP3 signaling. We found that the common LRRK2 mutation G2019S enhances HSV-
1 pathology in mice without altering viral replication. These results point to a novel role for LRRK2 in
inflammasome signaling and HSV-1 pathogenesis. We hypothesize that LRRK2 modulates inflammasome
signaling in response to HSV-1 infection and that the G2019S mutation further enhances inflammasome
activation in vivo, leading to more severe eye, skin, and central nervous system (CNS) pathology after HSV-1
infection. LRRK2 has not been studied in human viral infection, and these represent the first studies to define
its role in the pathogenesis of a common neurotropic human viral infection. In Aim 1, we will identify how
LRRK2 associates with NLRP3, the critical inflammasome adapter in HSV-1 infection, and how mutations in
LRRK2 alter inflammasome signaling in the context of HSV-1 infection. We will accomplish this by using
targeted mutagenesis in a transfection model of inflammasome signaling and by studying inflammasome
activation after HSV-1 infection of cell lines stably expressing LRRK2 mutants. For Aim 2, we will determine
how LRRK2 alters the inflammasome response to HSV-1 using LRRK2 transgenic mice and mice with
inflammasome gene disruptions. Additionally, the PI will gain critical skills and expertise necessary to study the
innate immune response to HSV-1 and other herpesviruses. These learning objectives will be accomplished
through formal coursework, scientific programing, and direct mentorship by experts in viral and murine
immunology, herpesvirology, and biostatistics. The proposed career development plan and research aims will
provide a pathway to a career as an independent investigator studying the interactions between herpesviruses
and the innate immune system."
10810835,"Abstract: Radiotracers containing [18F]-labeled electron-rich aromatic rings are among the most highly sought-
after PET imaging agents but have been historically challenging to synthesize. Recent efforts have sought to
improve the late-stage labeling of (hetero)arenes with [18F]fluoride. In particular, transition metal-mediated
reactions using high molar activity [18F]fluoride have changed the way radiochemists form C–18F bonds, and
copper-mediated radiofluorination (CMRF) has proven one of the most versatile of approaches. In the previous
award, we reported 10 new CMRF reactions, validated them for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), and used
them to synthesize FDA-approved clinical doses. However, despite many successes, several key challenges
remain for the widespread clinical application of CMRF: (a) many important organic scaffolds are incompatible
with existing CMRF processes, (b) yields of automated CMRF methods are typically moderate and thus
unsuitable for commercial distribution, and (c) disposable cassette technologies are not available for CMRF on
automated radiosynthesizers, limiting radiotracer production for routine clinical use. All of these challenges will
be addressed in this renewal proposal. The overall objective is to develop robust methods for clinical production
of diverse PET radiotracers. Our central hypothesis is that CMRF is uniquely positioned to enable us to achieve
this goal. The proposed research will identify new reactions to radiofluorinate scaffolds that are incompatible with
existing CMRF (Aim 1), use cutting edge machine learning techniques to improve automated CMRF yields (Aim
2), and develop cassette technologies for reliable GMP production of clinical radiotracers using CMRF (Aim 3).
The research is significant because it entails development of methods for radiolabeling bioactive molecules
containing functionality that is incompatible (or low yielding) with existing CMRF (heterocycles like pyridine and
morpholine, drug molecules like GW405833), as well as optimized automated methods and cassettes for
radiotracers that have been challenging to access for decades (e.g. [18F]FDOPA). The viability of the proposed
efforts is supported by extensive preliminary results that provide groundwork for the exciting new research
directions. Our team has been collaborating for 7 years and our expertise in transition metal catalysis (Sanford),
radiochemistry (Scott), and machine learning (Doyle) uniquely positions us to accomplish the proposed research.
The project goals will be accomplished through a variety of innovations including: (1) developing methods for
labeling challenging electron-rich (hetero)arenes from new precursors (C–H bonds, aryl halides), (2) the first
application of machine learning to radiochemistry, and (3) development of automated cassettes for conducting
CMRF using the newest generation of radiosynthesizers designed for plug-and-play production. Overall, this
project will deliver multiple new methods for synthesizing 18F-labeled radiotracers that are inaccessible using
existing methods, and validated clinical syntheses of important radiotracers. All of these deliverables will expand
the utility of PET imaging for the detection, treatment, and prevention of disease."
10833080,"Project Summary/Abstract
The correct implementation of developmental programs depends on information encoded in an organism's
DNA. Despite decades of work in dissecting the spatial control of gene expression in embryonic development,
we know relatively little about the temporal control of these programs—largely due to reliance on dead, fixed
tissues. Recently, our lab established new technologies for real-time measurements of input transcription factor
concentration dynamics and output transcriptional activity in single cells of the early embryo of the fruit fly
Drosophila melanogaster. Our measurements have revealed that the timing of transcription in development is
under precise control.
Here, we propose a dialogue between theory and experiment to dissect this largely unexplored layer of
transcriptional control using the regulation of the hunchback gene by the activator Bicoid and the pioneer-like
transcription factor Zelda as a case study. Recent work from our lab has suggested that hunchback
transcription ensues as a result of the transition of its promoter through multiple transcriptionally silent states.
In this model, Bicoid and Zelda catalyze the transitions between silent states, presumably by triggering the
acetylation of nearby histones. In order to systematically test this model of transcriptional onset and reveal the
molecular identities of the pathways involved in the dictating transcriptional onset, we will (i) exploit
optogenetics to determine whether the timing Bicoid- and Zelda-driven transcriptional onset is independent of
the control of mRNA production rates once transcription has already ensued, (ii) harness measurements of the
distribution of transcriptional onset times in single cells to uncover the structure of the biochemical cascade
leading to transcriptional onset and how this cascade is modulated by Bicoid and Zelda binding, and (iii)
identify the histone acetylases and deacetylases invoked by Bicoid and Zelda to dictate transcriptional onset, a
process that takes place at time scales that are not accessible by commonplace genome-wide approaches to
dissect the chromatin landscape.
Overall, our proposed work will establish a clear workflow for the dissection of this new layer of regulatory
control given by the timing of transcription in development and for uncovering the underlying molecular
pathways. This approach will be amenable to be implemented in other relevant genes in the fruit fly as well as
in other workhorses of developmental biology. Further, we envision that our quantitative and predictive
approach to dissecting developmental programs will empower future synthetic applications as well as
reengineering of multicellular organisms, for example to fix developmental defects or to halt states of
unchecked cellular proliferation."
10817192,"Tissue metabolism in ongoing inflammatory responses is an area of significant interest. Within the mucosa,
changes in metabolism are associated with shifts in availability of O2 and the expression of O2-sensitive genes,
particularly those regulated by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). As work in progress, we
have focused on understanding molecular pathways and functional endpoints initiated by the stabilization of
intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) HIF. These studies have revealed that diminished O2 availability (hypoxia) is a
major contributing factor to the resolution of intestinal inflammation. Studies from cultured cell systems, animal
models and human tissues have revealed that metabolites generated within the inflammatory
microenvironment are central to barrier regulation and anti-microbial function. Results from animal models of
intestinal inflammation have demonstrated an almost uniformly beneficial influence of HIF-1 stabilization on
disease outcomes, particularly related to the resolution of mucosal inflammation. Nonetheless, we believe that
there is significant untapped potential within this field of study. We hypothesize that HIF-1 and HIF-2-
dependent signaling evokes a pro-resolving epithelial phenotype during intestinal inflammation. Three
synergistic specific aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we will distinguish the select regulation of epithelial junctional
proteins by HIF-1 and HIF-2. Aim 2 will develop and test a new class of HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors
(PHDi) on mucosal barrier function and wound healing. Specific Aim 3 will evaluate in vivo endpoints of
pharmacological HIF stabilization. Results from these experiments will provide new insights into innate
regulation of mucosal barrier and an expanded role for PHDi in the resolution of mucosal inflammation. It is our
hope that extensions of this will lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets for mucosal inflammatory
disease."
10834016,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Mitochondria function is tightly regulated by a complex, intertwined machinery that dictates
mitochondrial gross morphology, transport of organelles, inner membrane and cristae morphology,
communication between adjacent mitochondria and contact with other organelles. These processes are
collectively known as mitochondrial dynamics. My overall goal is to reach a comprehensive understanding on
the mechanisms that govern mitochondrial dynamics and the interplay between mitochondrial transport with
other aspects of mitochondrial and cellular biology. While the mechanisms of mitochondrial transport had been
largely characterized in neurons, our recent advances showed that transport of energetically active
mitochondria to the cortical cytoskeleton supports lamellipodia dynamics, fuels turnover of focal adhesion
complexes and increases velocity and distance of random cell migration in epithelial cells. Because specialized
cell types have unique spatiotemporal needs for mitochondria functions, a fundamental question is how similar
are the mechanisms of mitochondrial movement between neurons and other cell types? Here we will focus on
characterizing the function and regulation of alternative isoforms of trafficking proteins that are expressed in
non-neuronal cells. Adding complexity to this picture, we have evidence of multifunctionality amongst trafficking
proteins in non-neuronal cells. These novel functions include mitochondrial metabolism and mitochondrial
signaling. This poses an important question: how are these multifunctional proteins regulated so single or
double functions are enabled at a particular time and location? Overall, my research program will lead to
discoveries on the regulation of mitochondrial trafficking and mitochondrial signaling pathways in non-neuronal
cells. Because mitochondria are key organelles that maintain cellular homeostasis, and mitochondrial
dysfunction are associated with neurological and metabolic diseases, cancer and aging, our advances have
the potential to inform how to exploit these mechanisms for practical applications in medicine."
10846785,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal’s overall goal is to understand the molecular mechanism of telescripting, a new and major gene
expression process that is crucial for full-length transcription of most protein-coding genes and regulates
messenger RNAs (mRNAs) isoforms and mRNA length in humans and other complex organisms. mRNAs are
processed from nascent RNA polymerase II (PolII) transcripts, which generally includes the removal of introns
(splicing) and transcription-terminating 3’-end cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA). Splicing and CPA are
specified by splice sites and CPA signals (PASs), respectively. However, numerous PASs indistinguishable
from the ultimate, gene ends’ PASs are scattered throughout pre-mRNAs, especially in introns and 3’
untranslated regions (3’UTRs), and can trigger premature CPA (PCPA). PCPA is suppressed by U1 snRNP
(U1), human cells’ most abundant small non-coding nuclear RNA-protein particle. For brevity, and to
distinguish it from U1’s role in splicing, we call U1 suppression of PCPA, telescripting (as it is necessary for
long-distance transcription). Like U1 function in splicing, telescripting also depends on U1 snRNA base-pairing
to nascent transcripts, which can be abrogated with U1 antisense oligonucleotides (U1 AMO), causing PCPA.
Recent studies revealed that even slight changes in the balance between U1 and PASs has great impact on
gene expression and can profoundly alter the mRNAs and proteins cells produce. Such changes occur
naturally, for example rapid transcription up-regulation during cell stimulation, and create transient U1 deficit
relative to transcription output, causing PCPA that produces shorter mRNA isoforms needed to respond to
acute environmental changes. Importantly, U1 AMO recapitulates the same mRNA isoform shifts and U1 over-
expression can prevent their production in stimulated cells. U1 AMO also elicits widespread 3'UTR shortening,
which occurs in and contributes to cell proliferation and cancer.
U1 telescripting’s overarching role in transcriptome regulation impacts transcription, splicing, CPA and thereby
all downstream events in the life of mRNAs. It has numerous potential applications in biology and medicine.
Realizing them requires detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism by which U1 suppresses PASs
and the factors that regulate it, which remain unknown. We have made significant progress towards that,
including mapping the transcriptome binding locations of U1 and cleavage and polyadenylation factors
(CPAFs), and interpreted them in relation to PCPA locations. We have also captured U1 and CPAFs
complexes in cells, determined their compositions and stoichiometries, and determined how cells produce the
great U1 abundance required for telescripting. These advances lay the foundation for future studies. I
anticipate the mechanistic studies and new information will identify potential points of intervention, including
druggable targets, and will advance the prospects of harnessing them for novel therapies."
10836978,"Abstract
The overall goal of the Fehl laboratory is to develop chemical biology strategies to determine the functional
impact of protein modifications during signaling processes. Specifically, cellular metabolism and stress each lead
to diverse protein modifications with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine sugar (O-GlcNAc) but no tools are currently
able to capture highly dynamic and transient O-GlcNAc events with defined time and spatial resolution. Lack of
“time and space” rigor hinders the scientific community from connecting metabolism with disease physiology,
including significantly elevated cancer risk in diabetic patients observed for malignancies like breast cancer.
In this MIRA application, we pose our strategies to address this critical gap through the development of real-time
and space molecular tools that bridge cell metabolism and cancer processes using O-GlcNAc as the keystone.
Excellent NIH-funded research has discovered over 2000 O-GlcNAc on proteins in human cells, but current tools
rely on disrupted physiology, leading to artifacts, or miss key GlcNAc-driven signaling events that occur before
global metabolic rebalancing occurs in less than an hour. We hypothesize that the key drivers of hyperglycemic
metabolism and pathology lie within the first few minutes of nutrient and signaling stimulation, which to date is
not possible to observe in living cells. Our published work in photochemistry and systems glycobiology support
our unique strategies to trigger O-GlcNAc processes in minutes, before O-GlcNAc rebalancing occurs. Our
photocaged sugar tool is able to trigger the oncogenic transcription factor NFkB movement between cytosol or
endoplasmic reticulum into the nucleus, simulating physiological events that potentially link aberrant insulin and
glucose release in diabetes with breast cancer risk. Our real time system can be used to track O-GlcNAc events
during insulin signaling for the first time during the rapid, 15-minute pulses of diseased insulin physiology.
Another tool for targeted intracellular O-GlcNAc-targeted proximity labeling is able to track O-GlcNAcylated
proteins in subcellular space, which no reported tool has the capability to specifically label in live cells. We
propose in the next 5 years to develop our “time and space” molecular tools and apply them for unique
mechanistic studies in disease biology through NFkB targeting. We actively collaborate with metabolic disease
and cancer specialists to ensure disease relevance, as well as with industrial scientists for technology
development to expand industrial awareness of O-GlcNAc biology in metabolism-driven disease pathways.
The research outputs of this proposal include molecular probes, spatiotemporal strategies, and targets to
connect cellular metabolism with signaling. Our enabling chemical strategies have the potential for broad impact
in the scientific community by establishing temporal and spatial methods to study protein modifications. Our
platforms can be extended to other PTMs and drug targets, such as sialic acid modifications that regulate the
interface of cancer metabolism and inflammation. Success will establish a lasting independent research niche."
10837880,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Brain pathology begins accumulating in early adulthood and is detectable in almost all brains by older age. Yet,
there is remarkable heterogeneity in cognitive aging, and most aged adults do not evidence cognitive
impairment or dementia. Uncovering the naturally occurring processes that support this cognitive resilience to
neuropathology burden may yield potent targets to prevent or slow Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
(ADRD). We hypothesize that maintained synaptic integrity and physical activity may represent two such
protective factors. Synaptic communication is the foundational underpinning of cognition. Increasing data
suggest that preserved synaptic integrity may support clinical functioning regardless of pathology presence or
etiology. Further, physical activity is a highly implicated resilience behavior that has also been linked to
synaptic maintenance in animals. Our goal is to determine the synaptic biology that may underlie cognitive
resilience and physical activity in humans. We will collaborate across two ADRC programs to leverage their
unique strengths. In the Rush Memory and Aging Project (R-MAP), brain tissue samples from autopsied adults
followed in life will be used to quantify >150 synaptic protein markers (n=869). In the UCSF Memory and Aging
Center (UC-MAC), cerebrospinal fluid samples from longitudinally followed living older adults will be used to
quantify seven synaptic protein markers (n=200). Both cohorts complete longitudinal actigraphy monitoring as
an index of physical activity levels, and comprehensive neurobehavioral assessments. Cognitive resilience will
be operationalized as the discrepancy between neuropathology markers and cognitive performances. Aim one
will identify the in-depth synaptic networks (R-MAP) and the longitudinal, dynamic nature (UC-MAC) between
synaptic markers and cognitive resilience. Aim two will apply innovative machine learning techniques to identify
precise actigraphy features that most robustly relate to in-depth synaptic networks (R-MAP), longitudinal
synaptic marker changes (UC-MAC), and cognitive resilience (both). Accomplishing these aims will
significantly impact the ADRD field. We are designed to carefully identify synaptic and exercise features that
support sustained cognitive resilience using cutting edge measurement technologies, analytics, and
exceptional collaborative expertise. This proposal represents a bridging between two national ADRCs to more
powerfully address high impact questions than could be answered by either individually."

A metabolically active cell contains as many as 107 ribosomes, which are composed of RNA and protein. These complex biochemical machines synthesize proteins at a rate of 200 amino acids per minute with extremely high efficiency and fidelity. Germline or somatic defects in genes encoding components or regulators for ribosome assembly or function cause ribosomopathies, which occur in pediatric and adult patients. Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is a prototypic ribosomopathy. SDS is characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, neutropenia, skeletal dysplasia, and short stature. Genetic ablation of Sbds results in early embryonic lethality (ED 6.5) in mice. The zebrafish Sbds protein is ~90% identical to the human ortholog. We created sbds, efl1, and eif6 zebrafish knockout strains that phenocopy SDS. Based on biochemical and genetic analysis of human and fish tissues, we hypothesize that the loss of SBDS produces disease due to EIF6 accumulation and subsequent aberrant metabolism. When these biochemical responses are excessive, metabolic defects, growth arrest, cell death, and tissue atrophy ensue. Initially adaptive, TP53 mutations may become maladaptive. Using available zebrafish, cell lines, and patient-derived tissues and established methods, we propose the following specific aim to address our hypothesis: Identify the cellular compartment for EIF6 accumulation and characterize its effects on metabolic pathways that could contribute to the pathogenesis of SDS. Our long-term goals are to gain greater knowledge on how ribosomopathies cause human disease and translate new biomedical knowledge to improve the quality of life for those afflicted, particularly SDS."
10809746,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the human stomach. H. pylori colonization of the
stomach results in chronic gastric mucosal inflammation and is a strong risk factor for gastric cancer and
duodenal or gastric ulceration. Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and
H. pylori has been classified as a type I carcinogen by the World Health Organization. The H. pylori CagA protein
is secreted through a type IV secretion system (T4SS), enters gastric cells, and causes alterations in cellular
signaling associated with malignant transformation. CagA and components of the Cag T4SS are encoded by
genes within a chromosomal region known as the cag pathogenicity island (PAI), which is present in some H.
pylori strains but not others. The incidence of symptomatic gastroduodenal disease (gastric cancer or peptic
ulceration) is higher among individuals infected with cag PAI-positive strains than among those infected with cag
PAI-negative strains. The molecular architecture and protein composition of the H. pylori Cag T4SS differ
substantially from corresponding features of T4SSs found in other bacterial species. The overarching long-term
goal of this research is to develop a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which H. pylori causes
gastric disease. During the previous funding period, we isolated a transmembrane core complex of the Cag
T4SS containing five proteins encoded by the cag PAI, described three main structural features of the complex
(outer membrane cap, periplasmic ring and stalk), and built partial models of three proteins within the complex.
The aims of the current proposal are i) to build a complete structural model of the five Cag T4SS core complex
components; ii) to define structure-function relationships for CagY (a core complex component predicted to span
from the inner membrane to the outer membrane), elucidating its role in CagA recruitment and T4SS activity;
and (iii) to define actions of the Cag T4SS in vivo. Methods will include single particle cryo-electron microscopy
analysis of the T4SS core complex, specialized techniques for genetic manipulation of H. pylori, cell culture-
based assays of Cag T4SS activity, and an animal model of H. pylori-induced gastric cancer. These studies will
provide important advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which H. pylori infection can
lead to gastric cancer and other gastric diseases. On a broader scope, these studies will increase our
understanding of bacterial secretion systems and the delivery of bacterial virulence factors into host cells, as
well as molecular mechanisms underlying microbe-induced carcinogenesis."

 2 The overarching goals of the African Americans Fighting Alzheimer’s in Midlife (AA-FAIM) renewal are to
 3 promote timely and valid detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) in Black
 4 populations and to increase inclusion of Black adults in ADRD research. Being racialized as Black in the US is
 5 associated with twice the risk of cognitive decline and ADRD relative to non-Hispanic whites. Yet, because Black
 6 Americans are substantially under-recruited and under-represented in ADRD research, gaps remain in our
 7 understanding of the generalizability of prevailing theories of preclinical AD pathophysiology (e.g. the amyloid
 8 hypothesis) to Black patients. To address these gaps, we must obtain essential biomarker data from Black
 9 participants and improve inclusion of Black participants, examining recruitment/retention with scientific rigor. In
10 Aim 1, we will explore the relevance of preclinical amyloidosis in predicting cognitive decline in a Black cohort,
11 comparing models considering roles of (a) preclinical AD pathology, (b) vascular risk factors, (c) psychosocial
12 factors, and (d) cognitive markers in predicting cognitive decline in a cohort of 400 Black adults. Aim 2 will
13 examine the association between plasma Aß42/40 and Amyloid PET positivity (PET A+) and test the
14 chronicity/EAOA (estimated age of amyloid onset) model of preclinical AD in Black participants. We will
15 investigate associations between plasma Aß42/40 and concurrent PET A+, and assess whether longer amyloid
16 chronicity and/or earlier EAOA are associated with accelerated cognitive decline. Aim 3 examines factors
17 associated with successful enrollment and retention. We will assess patterns of perceptions and beliefs relative
18 to an emerging model of participant engagement, and explore model constructs’ efficacy in predicting
19 prospective participation decisions. With renewed investment in the AA-FAIM cohort, we will continue
20 contributing to an emerging understanding of preclinical ADRD in a minoritized population. Moreover, we can
21 further leverage our participants’ contributions by partnering with teams seeking access to these unique data."
10762980,"Project Summary/Abstract
Dr Madabhushi has emerged as a pioneer in the development and application of novel and interpretable Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithms for disease diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of treatment response for a variety
of diseases including several cancers, cardiovascular, kidney and eye disease. Veterans, in many cases on
account of their exposure to wartime environments and particular lifestyle choices, engenders different disease
phenotypes compared to the civilian population. Over the last three years he has been optimizing and tailoring
AI tools to addressing problems in precision medicine for Veterans. While his primary focus has been on
diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of treatment response of lung, oropharyngeal, breast and prostate cancers
for the Veteran population, he is also focused on translating and deploying these clinical decision support tools
across VA stations and VISNs so that Veterans can experience precision medicine across different diseases.
Dr Madabhushi's research within the VA began in 2019 with a VA Merit award (I01BX004121) focused on AI
based lung cancer screening for VA patients, specifically helping to discriminate malignant from benign nodules
on routine CT scans. This work has led to development of AI driven imaging biomarkers for predicting response
to immunotherapy for lung cancer patients. More recently in a paper just published in the J of Immunotherapy
for Cancer1, Dr. Madabhushi's group demonstrated the utility of radiomics on CT scans to identify clinical
outcome for Stage III lung cancer patients treated with chemo-radiation therapy and immunotherapy.
Interestingly, the work showed that a subset of patients identified by his AI-based approach might be able to
avoid chemo-radiation therapy and hence the associated toxicity. The study included a cohort of 15 patients from
the Cleveland VA. Similarly, his team has been developing and applying AI tools both for digital pathology as
well as on radiology scans for risk stratification of oropharyngeal cancers within the VA. This work was achieved
through collaboration with Vlad Sandulache at the Houston VA and with Stephen Connelly at the San Francisco
VA that has resulted in a series of high impact manuscripts (J of NCI, J of Clinical Investigation, Modern
Pathology) and an NCI funded R01 (R01CA249992).
In order to expand his work and footprint within the VA, he and his team have received funding support (in 2021)
from the Cooperative Services Program to create a VA Hub for Computer Vision and Machine Learning in
Precision Oncology (CoMPL). This new VA Hub will create computer vision and machine learning (CVML) tools
for addressing cancer diagnosis, prognosis, risk stratification and prediction of treatment response in the VA
population. The objectives of CoMPL are: 1) focus on building the computational infrastructure and tools to allow
for expanding the scope and access to CVML resources within the VA, and building a community to enable VA
researchers to take advantage of these tools to develop their own CVML applications; and 2) to develop new
companion diagnostic tools for risk assessment, predicting response and need for more or less aggressive
therapy in prostate and lung cancer. An initial demonstration project of CoMPL will focus on application of AI
tools with CT scans and digital pathology images to identify benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage
Veteran lung cancer patients. Dr. Madabhushi's is also leading a new prostate cancer collaborative involving
urologists, radiologists and oncologists from multiple different VA stations and VISNs to develop the use of AI
with multimodal imaging (MRI and digital pathology) along with genomics for more accurate risk stratification of
Veterans with high-risk prostate cancer. The CoMPL team is partnering with the National Artificial Intelligence
Institute (NAII), Lung Cancer Precision Oncology (LPOP) and Precision Oncology Program for Cancer of the
Prostate (POPCaP) centers to enable dissemination of the decision support tools and the deeply annotated
digital pathology and radiology scans that result from CoMPL's activities."
10765676,"Studies in humans and non-human primates have identified a region of the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum
(DCN), or lateral nucleus in rodents (LCN), which is activated during performance of complex cognitive tasks.
We have previously shown that the dopamine D1 receptor and the vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (Vglut2)
mark different populations of neurons in the LCN and modulate cognitive performance on tasks related to
attention and working memory. The DCN is implicated in cognitive function in humans with psychiatric
illnesses, but virtually nothing is known about its basic anatomical and functional organization. Unraveling this
will set the stage for precision therapeutics in the cognitive domain, an area where we have few options to offer
Veterans with psychiatric disorders. Veterans with PTSD and TBI, for example, show neuroanatomical and
clinical markers of cerebellar dysfunction which correlate with the severity of cognitive and PTSD symptoms.
Aberrant dopamine signaling arising from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is also a likely contributor to
dysfunction in PTSD, and it has been repeatedly shown by our group and others that cerebellar nuclei have
inputs to the ventral tegmental area, a brain region at the heart of the mesolimbic dopamine system which
mediates reward and fear learning. VTA and cerebellar circuits (LCN and posterolateral cerebellar cortex) are
strongly implicated in the sensation and production of prediction errors (reward/threat and sensory errors,
respectively) for cognitive and emotional function. Humans with discrete cerebellar lesions manifest
neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression, reduced language and social interactions, impaired interval
timing, disturbances of working memory, spatial cognition, and attention in the absence of motor deficits. When
we have experimentally perturbed catecholaminergic inputs to the LCN in mice, we have found impairments in
behavioral flexibility, response inhibition, social recognition memory, and associative fear learning relative to
controls, but no deficits in gross motor, sensory, instrumental learning, or sensorimotor gating functions. We
hypothesize that one source of aberrant cognitive function in psychiatric disorder stems from faulty circuitry
between the well-characterized VTA and the understudied cerebellum. Notably, cerebellar activations seen in
Parkinson’s Disease, after recovery from stroke in humans, and experimental animal models of
hemispherectomy demonstrate the necessity of cerebellum in recovery. Whether these cerebellar mechanisms
are active in the etiology of cognitive dysfunction, or whether they can be recruited by an intervention during
recovery is unknown. It is well known that following associative or reinforcement learning, the VTA dopamine
signal shifts to a cue which predicts a reward or threat. When conditioned stimuli (CS+) are presented and
rewards are omitted, dopamine neurons in the VTA display prediction errors. The overarching hypothesis of
this grant is that the cerebellum facilitates this type of learning, and that circuit dysfunction between the LCN
and VTA may be a critical component of different psychiatric disorders. We will use mice with a targeted
mutation of Vglut2 in combination with specific viral, optogenetic, in vivo electrophysiology and fiber
photometry approaches to characterize and manipulate the activity of specific LCN Neurons projecting to VTA.
Leveraging these cutting-edge tools paired with classical behavioral assays will offer insights into this circuit,
which holds promise as a target of intervention with neuromodulatory, behavioral, or pharmacological
approaches."

Leukemia is the most common pediatric cancer affecting more than 40,000 children worldwide each year. During
the last decades, childhood leukemia incidence has increased in the US by ~35% overall, with an even larger
rise among LatinX. Similar trends are also observed in several Latin American countries. This rapid increase
points to the critical role of environmental factors in the development childhood leukemia, possibly in combination
with genetic factors. Despite improved prognosis of childhood leukemia overall, there are major differences by
subtype, region, racial/ethnic group, and socio-economic status, and leukemia survivors remain at risk for serious
lifelong complications. Altogether, these observations highlight the need to support more research and
prevention to reduce leukemia burden and disparity. The overall objective of this U24 competing renewal is to
expand the support of existing population studies (here case-control design) to accelerate childhood leukemia
environmental research and prevention, with a focus on LatinX populations. In the first R24 cycle (2017-22), we
maintained and enhanced the resources and data sharing of two NIEHS-funded studies with large numbers of
LatinX children in California, United States and Guatemala. To further address childhood leukemia disparity in
LatinX, while increasing diversity of the research team, we now propose to (i) include additional childhood
leukemia studies with low-resources in Mexico and Costa Rica, (ii) coordinate research translation/prevention
among participating countries, and (iii) collaborate with LatinX researchers and health workers in California and
Latin America. The four participating studies have enrolled 8,480 childhood leukemia cases and 4,462 controls,
and have collected a wealth of environmental/genetic data and biospecimens providing the most comprehensive
resources in LatinX populations worldwide. Individually or as part of the Childhood Cancer and Leukemia
Consortium (CLIC), these studies have produced seminal findings, documenting the prenatal origin of childhood
leukemia and identifying many factors that contribute to the increased or decreased risks of the disease including
chemical exposures, diet/vitamins, breastfeeding, immune response, birthweight and genetic factors. The
maintenance of these resources and the enhancement of data sharing procedures are needed to efficiently
expand ongoing etiologic and tumor-biology studies of childhood leukemia, especially myeloid subtypes which
are more common in LatinX, and uncover sources of disparity in leukemia risk and outcomes. To achieve our
goals, we plan to (1) use an interoperable management system REDCap to provide unifying support for
management, harmonization, storage and sharing of study resources; (2) enrich case-control studies by
conducting linkages to population-level databases on exposures to potential carcinogenic agents/mixtures and
social/built environments; (3) facilitate broader data use nationally and internationally with the CLIC Consortium,
and (4) expand community engagement with the public, lay health workers, and health professionals in the US
and Latin American countries to increase awareness about preventable risk factors of childhood leukemia."
10797006,"PROJECT ABSTRACT: A primary cause of death for most persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) is respiratory
failure caused by damaging chronic lung infections and inflammation. Staphylococcus aureus is the most
common cause of lung infections in the US CF population, with 70% of patients testing positive for S. aureus
in 2018. There are two subtypes of S. aureus that are particularly worrying because they are linked to lower
lung function and higher risk of death: methicillin-resistant S. aureus (or MRSA) and small colony variants (or
SCVs). Approximately 50% of CF patients test positive for MRSA and 28% test positive for SCVs. Testing for
S. aureus, MRSA, and SCVs heavily relies upon the collection of sputum, but as CF care improves and use
of CFTR modulators increases, the production of sputum is declining, though the risk of lung infections
persists. Therefore, novel methods for diagnosing lung infections without sputum are urgently needed.
Our long-term goal is to develop a breath test for the detection of S. aureus MRSA and SCV in chronic CF
lung infections. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify putative breath biomarkers of MRSA and
SCVs and to determine their diagnostic accuracy. Our central hypothesis is that volatile biomarkers in breath
can be used to rapidly and sensitively detect MRSA and SCVs, independent of co-infections with other
species, or the presence of other S. aureus isolates. We will test our hypothesis by leveraging well-
characterized S. aureus isolates from the Small Colony Variant S. aureus (SCVSA) study (Aim 1), and paired
sputum and breath specimens from the IMproving P. Aeruginosa deteCTion using Breath (IMPACT-Breath)
study (Aim 2). The expected outcomes of this project are breath biomarkers of S. aureus MRSA and SCVs,
and estimates of their sensitivity and specificity in the breath of persons with CF.
Aim 1: Identify putative volatile biomarkers of MRSA, SCVs, and MRSA-SCVs grown in vitro. We will
characterize the volatile metabolomes of methicillin sensitive-normal colony variant (MSSA-NCV), MRSA-
NCV, MSSA-SCV, and MRSA-SCV isolates cultured in vitro, utilizing 100 sequenced and phenotyped isolates
from the SCVSA study. We hypothesize that there are distinct volatile biomarkers for MRSA vs. MSSA and
for SCV vs. NCV isolates, and that a novel set of biomarkers are produced by MRSA-SCV isolates.
Aim 2: Refine putative volatile biomarkers of MRSA and SCV and estimate their accuracy in the breath
of persons with CF. We will analyze paired sputum and breath samples from 100 S. aureus positive CF lung
infections from the IMPACT-Breath study. We will use culture-dependent and culture-independent methods
to identify and quantify MRSA and SCVs in the sputum and correlate these data to each subject’s breath
volatiles. We hypothesize that volatile biomarkers for MRSA and SCV will be detected in the breath of persons
that are culture-positive for these S. aureus subtypes, even in the presence of other microbial species, and in
the presence of MSSA and NCVs."
10811761,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA), caused mainly by A. fumigatus, is the most prevalent invasive mold infection of
immunocompromised individuals and is associated with mortality rates of 35-90%. Only three classes of anti-
Aspergillus drugs exist. The global rise of resistance to the triazole class and the unacceptably high patient
toxicity of the polyene class limits the use of two of these. The remaining class, the echinocandins, are generally
considered effective therapeutic agents as their target is fungus-specific (cell wall biosynthesis) and they exhibit
low toxicity. However, the echinocandins are not fungicidal for Aspergillus species and a paradoxical effect of
treatment, characterized by decreased drug effectiveness with increasing drug concentrations, has been
described both in vivo and in vitro. Likely due to these issues, high incidence breakthrough infections during
echinocandin therapy have been reported. Therefore, echinocandin use for IA is also limited. The discovery of
mechanisms essential for echinocandin stress adaptation and survival is expected to improve therapeutic
efficacy with these important compounds by identifying fungal targets for future combination therapies. To
delineate novel mechanisms orchestrating echinocandin stress responses, we recently completed the
generation of a protein kinase disruption mutant library in a wild type genetic background. This library was
constructed using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing to disrupt each of the 142 putative protein kinases encoded by
the A. fumigatus genome. A total of 118 non-essential, unique gene disruptions were achieved and subsequently
employed for in vitro echinocandin susceptibility assays. Our preliminary assays identified a total of 12 protein
kinase disruption mutants displaying 4- to >32-fold decreased minimum effective concentrations (MEC)
compared to the parental strain. We have discovered that two of these mutations, residing in the previously
uncharacterized SepL and SidB kinases, impart fungicidal anti-Aspergillus activity to multiple echinocandins.
These protein kinases are predicted to be core components of the Septation Initiation Network (SIN), a three-
kinase cascade that is necessary for septation in fungi. Our exciting preliminary data show that blocking septation
via loss of any single SIN kinase causes widespread hyphal damage and loss of viability in response to
echinocandin treatment. In addition, employing the sepL disruption mutant, we have found that echinocandin
therapy improves survival and eliminates residual tissue burden in a mouse model of IA. As septa are important
for the limitation of mechanical injury to hyphae, and the A. fumigatus SIN is completely uncharacterized,
exploration of this network is expected to reveal novel effectors of echinocandin stress survival. Our aims are to
identify core SIN components required for unlocking echinocandin cidal activity (Aim 1), define temporal
requirements for enhancement of echinocandin activity resulting from septation blockade (Aim 2), and to
delineate the SIN pathway-dependent septum construction machinery (Aim 3). Our work will identify the SIN
components with the highest potential for benefit when targeted in combination with echinocandin therapy."

Second, neuroimaging has expanded our knowledge of age- and disease-related brain changes in living
humans and proven to be a useful tool in the discovery and development of new drugs. Neuroimaging
measures are often considered as eligibility criteria in trial study designs and for interim assessment of drug
performance. Third, PET and MRI in AD and AD-related dementias ensures training in multidisciplinary team
science.
 This T32 will support 4 postdoctoral training slots to be filled by PhD, MD, and/or MD/PhD applicants.
There will be 20 senior faculty and 7 junior faculty, largely affiliated with the MGH Martinos Center for
Biomedical Imaging and the Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. The Directors of both
centers are T32 faculty. These centers strongly support diversity and inclusion. Our goal is to recruit women
and underrepresented minorities (URM) into 3 of the 4 slots to help address the need for a diverse workforce
and URM participation in AD-related research. Training includes the responsible conduct of research and
ethics and career development.
 Each trainee will be matched with a primary mentor, secondary mentor, and a junior faculty mentor. This
will help to ensure strong mentorship in primary and secondary focus areas and facilitate team building and
feedback. All trainees will serve as mentors in summer training programs. Evaluation of the T32 program will
include an annual External Advisory Committee meeting review (all members external to Harvard Medical
School), biannual Internal Steering Committee meetings; and quarterly trainee evaluations. The trainees will
gain experience in rigorous research practices, diverse team science, and mentoring and will be well
positioned to pursue independent funding in AD-related research at the end of the T32 training period."

Smartphone-based mindfulness intervention for reducing stress-related CVD risk
Chronic psychosocial stress has been shown to be associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease
(CVD), and exaggerated stress-related cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) has also been linked with elevated CVD
risk. Most of the evidence in these literatures is based upon correlational data to date. Progress in characterizing
and ameliorating these effects requires the development of standardized intervention tools designed to alter
stress exposure and reactivity. Mobile health interventions may provide a useful approach to this problem. We
have identified two specific daily life measures of psychosocial stress and stress reactivity, measured by
ambulatory monitoring, that are associated with markers of subclinical atherosclerosis. We have also developed
a smartphone-based mindfulness training program that appears to produce significant reductions in related
measures of daily life stress and acute stress-related physiological responding. The current study is designed to
examine whether this mobile health intervention is feasible and effective in addressing the stress-related targets
we have identified, in a population selected for vulnerability to stress and to CVD. We will examine whether
additional practice prompts that are presented during daily life (in the spirit of “Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions” or JITAIs) increase the magnitude or duration of treatment effects, and we will also explore whether
we can develop a model to assist us in identifying the circumstances in which automated prompting may be
fruitfully employed as part of this treatment. The goal is to produce a scalable mobile health intervention that
can be shown to reduce progression of preclinical CVD as part of a subsequent Phase 2 clinical trial.
RELEVANCE:
Developing interventions for reducing the effects of psychosocial stress on cardiovascular disease is of critical
importance for public health."

A significant body of research shows that having money is highly correlated with better health. But determining
how much of the association is causal is challenging. The gold standard for determining causality is prospective
random assignment of treatment, but practical and ethical considerations often make it hard to award money or
equivalent resources in a truly random way. Thus, researchers have used longitudinal studies of parents’ income
and children’s health or exogenous changes in social and fiscal policy to show that additional money lowers
mortality. But studies with true randomization—lottery winners and people randomly given different levels of
health insurance—show more modest influences of money on mortality. This study produces the first ever
estimates of how randomly awarded wealth affects mortality over a lifetime of follow-up in two generations, for
both men and women, and constructs a policy relevant metric of the incremental wealth required for an additional
year of life expectancy. The project analyzes the long-term implications of a major land redistribution policy in
New Zealand in which low interest loans for farms were awarded by lottery. Program terms ensured applicants
were of similar economic status, and the policy operated like a true random experiment. Loan terms were similar
to modern mortgages: low annual payments over a long term. Documents show randomization was adhered to
for over 20 years. New Zealand’s universal, centralized death registration facilitates construction of a matched
intergenerational sample of lottery winners and losers and their children. Ninety percent of applicants can be
linked to death records, which is a significantly higher linkage rate than can be obtained in the US. These
estimates will be a lower bound on how much money matters for health because New Zealand had low inequality,
high life expectancy, and the subjects were born in an era when infectious disease was an important cause of
death. This R21 project has four aims: 1) estimate the causal effects of winning land on lottery participants’
mortality, 2) estimate the causal effects of winning land on the mortality of children of lottery participants, 3)
estimate gender differences in the effects of wealth on mortality, and 4) identify potential mechanisms that
contributed to life expectancy differences. The study design combines the inferential strengths of true random
assignment in a block design with additional contrasts between children born before and after their parents
participated in the lottery to identify effects of wealth on mortality in two generations. Contrasts in effect sizes by
sex, birth order, and generation are used to identify potential causal mechanisms. Causal mediation analysis of
early adult health measures, mid-life occupational status, urban or rural residence, and lifetime wealth
accumulation illuminate potential pathways between wealth and reduced mortality. The proposed research, with
a credible causal identification strategy and lifetime follow-up, will contribute significantly to knowledge of how
money and social status affect health, aging, and mortality."

 Diarrhea causes monovalent (e.g., Na+, K+, Cl- and HCO3-) and divalent (e.g., Zn2+, Ca2+) ion losses. Unlike the
losses of monovalent ions which are large and are therefore replaced through rehydration therapy, the losses of divalent ions
are relatively small in osmoles and are often overlooked during diarrheal treatment. Studies now suggest that despite divalent
ions contributing relatively few osmoles in the stool, their effects are large due to the presence of divalent ion-sensing
receptors (e.g., Zn2+-sensing receptor, ZnSR; Ca2+-sensing receptor, CaSR) and their amplifying effects in the gut. As a
result, losses of these divalent ions without replacement may affect the magnitude of, or recovery from acute diarrheal
illnesses. Without replacement of Zn2+ and restoration of ZnSR anti-diarrheal function, diarrhea is more severe and
protracted; adding back Zn2+ and correcting ZnSR defect reduce the severity and duration of diarrhea. This is well
documented. However, information on the role of Ca2+ and CaSR in diarrhea is limited. The PI’s laboratory at the
University of Florida was the first to report the presence of a potent Ca2+/CaSR-based antidiarrheal mechanism in the
gastrointestinal tract. After demonstrating Ca2+/CaSR action in childhood diarrhea in laboratory animals, the PI and his
coworkers presented clinical evidence in few cases of children with diarrheal diseases. These preliminary studies in humans
show that, like Zn2+, without correcting negative Ca2+ balance, diarrheal symptoms were more severe or more protracted
and that, with replacement of Ca2+, diarrhea was both promptly and dramatically reduced in both animals and humans. Based
on this, it is hypothesized that an ideal diarrhea replacement therapy will be a solution that replaces both monovalent ions
and divalent minerals, particularly Ca2+. However, so far, no formal randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on Ca2+
replacement in diarrheal patients have been performed. This proposed study represents the first of such efforts. In this initial
study, we propose to obtain pilot data to demonstrate the safety and effect size of Ca2+ replacement on clinical outcomes
(stool output and diarrhea duration) in adults with acute infectious diarrhea before more powerful and expensive RCTs are
conducted, including in infants and young children. We anticipate that prompt replacement of Ca2+ will significantly reduce
the severity and shorten the duration of diarrhea symptoms."
10739311,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Cryptococcus neoformans is one of the most common fungal pathogens, responsible for over 200,000
deaths yearly, mostly in the immunocompromised. Unfortunately, due to medical advances such as chemother-
apy or steroid treatments, this population of susceptible individuals is increasing. Despite the increasing burden
of cryptococcal disease, there are only three clinically available therapeutics, and they are plagued by cost,
toxicity, and recently, antifungal resistance. Making the situation even more challenging, the pathogenesis of
Cryptococcus is incompletely understood, limiting the number of potential targets or processes that could be
used as intervention points. All of this has resulted in a mortality rate that ranges from ~20% in the US and
Europe, to >71% in Africa and Southeast Asia. Therefore, there is a clear need to improve the current anticryp-
tococcal drugs and to better understand the fungal-host interactions, which could lead to novel and more effective
treatments. This application addresses both of these needs. The fungal-host interactions, particularly the inter-
actions with the lung macrophages, will determine the outcome of the infection. While investigating the
interactions between cryptococci and macrophages, we identified an uncharacterized fungal gene that affects
phagocytosis by macrophages. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of this gene, which we are calling PDR6,
shows that it contains all the features of ABC transporters of the PDR family, which are usually efflux pumps.
Consistently, this mutant is hypersensitive to fluconazole, the mainstay treatment for cryptococcosis, and shows
an altered antifungal profile relative to wild-type. Notably, infection of a murine model with this mutant results in
attenuation and altered progression of the disease. This proposal is organized to study these two phenotypes:
altered antifungal responses (Aim 1) and altered virulence and host interactions (Aim 2). Hence, we are tackling
the two general problems that are currently preventing an appropriate management of this disease. In Aim 1 we
will elucidate the function of Pdr6 and determine how it affects the sensitivity of the cell to fluconazole and other
antifungals. In Aim 2 we will identify the Pdr6-dependent changes in the fungal cell and the host that result in
altered host interactions and attenuated virulence. These two aims, although independent, are complimentary,
and will be performed in parallel. Completion of the aims proposed will result in a significant advancement of
both (1) our understanding of ABC transporter functions in general, and specifically in Cryptococcus, and (2) our
understanding of fungal-host interactions and their contribution to virulence. These results will synergize with the
other projects in the lab, and will open multiple new directions of research that will be used for future grant
applications. Interestingly, close homologs of PDR6 are present in many pathogenic fungi, but are absent from
the model non-pathogenic ones, hence the discoveries here will have broad impact in the fungal field."
10877671,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Opioid-based drugs are mainstays for pain management despite the risk of dependence, addiction, and
cognitive impairments, even when taken as directed. Yet, the neurological underpinnings of opioid addiction
remain relatively under-investigated, thereby limiting our understanding of the neural and associated
psychological basis of addiction to opioids. Impaired decision-making, strong perseverance and an extraordinary
motivation to obtain drug are widely seen as core aspects of addiction. These behaviors are expressed only by
a fraction of those exposed to the drug – highlighting a significant degree of individual variability and a need to
identify largely unknown factors that convey risk or resilience. Hypofunction of prefrontal circuits has emerged
as a primary mechanism by which this transition occurs, however evidence regarding the nature, sub-circuit(s)
locus, and development of this hypofunction is lacking. Our published data find that self-administration (SA) of
the potent opioid, remifentanil (Rem), promotes a progressive hypoactive state in prelimbic cortex (PrL)
pyramidal neurons that underlies impairments in cognitive flexibility, and that this phenomenon occurs on a faster
timeline in females. Pilot data indicate inflexibility aligns with increased perseverative drug seeking and
motivation for drug that is more prominent in females. We predict these changes emerge as a result of changes
in PL-Core circuits, as pilot data indicate that hypoactivity is more prominent in PrL-Core PN and that this
plasticity aligns with sex- and cell-type specific adaptations in synaptic strength at downstream Core medium
spiny neurons (MSNs) based on expression of dopamine type I (D1) versus type II (D2) receptors. This proposal
will combine circuit-specific ex vivo measures of plasticity, in vivo Ca2+ imaging, and chemogenetics with a novel
SA model that permits longitudinal assessment of individual variability in the development of motivated and
perseverative drug-seeking and a clinically relevant operant model to assess cognitive flexibility (strategy
shifting) to identify changes from synapse to function to behavior. Aim1 of this proposal will further investigate
exposure dependent changes within PrL-Core circuits using pathway-specific ex vivo electrophysiology.
Intersectional chemogenetic manipulations will assess the contribution of this circuit flexibility and drug seeking
and whether dysfunction underlies deficits in flexibility and changes in perseverance/motivation. Aim2 will use
Ca2+ imaging to examine the corresponding disruptive effects of opioid plasticity on PrL-Core information
processing associated with decision making and measure longitudinal changes in basal states and activity
encoding opioid taking with progressive SA. Aim 3 will identify synaptic modifications at PrL-Core D1- and D2-
MSN synapses. Contralateral chemogenetic targeting will determine contributions of PrL-to-D1-MSN and PrL-
to-D2-MSN circuits in flexibility and longitudinally determine if contributions to opioid taking and behavior shifts
over time. Proposed studies will provide novel insight into progressively developing changes in function and
behavior, with the potential to inform more tailored treatments based on sex and stage of addiction."
10843807,"During the second cycle of this Multiple Principal Investigator R01 grant, we investigated lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and GPIHBP1 (the endothelial cell protein that shuttles LPL to the capillary lumen) and the roles of both proteins in the lipolytic processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs). We were productive, publishing >20 manuscripts, all in top-tier journals. Of note, we discovered a new human disease—chylomicronemia from GPIHBP1 autoantibodies. We defined the pathophysiology of that disease and with our collaborators showed that the disease can be treated quite effectively with rituximab, resulting in disappearance of autoantibodies and normalization of plasma triglyceride levels. We also explored basic physiologic mechanisms for intravascular lipolysis. We showed that LPL is active as a monomer, dispelling decades-old dogma that LPL is a homodimer. We showed that GPIHBP1 preserves the structure and activity of LPL's hydrolase domain. We solved the atomic structure of the LPL–GPIHBP1 complex, which provided insights into how GPIHBP1 stabilizes LPL and how specific LPL and GPIHBP1 mutations cause human disease. For the third grant cycle, we have two specific aims. The first is to test the hypothesis that GPIHBP1's acidic domain is crucial for the movement of LPL–GPIHBP1 complexes from the abluminal to the luminal plasma membrane (PM) of capillary endothelial cells. We recently created gene-edited mice expressing a mutant GPIHBP1 lacking the acidic domain. GPIHBP1's LU domain was unaltered; hence, the mutant GPIHBP1 was able to bind LPL. Unexpectedly, the absence of the acidic domain impeded trafficking of the GPIHBP1–LPL complex from the abluminal PM of endothelial cells to the capillary lumen. We suspect that the movement of LPL–GPIHBP1 complexes away from the abluminal plasma membrane was impeded by persistent electrostatic interactions between the GPIHBP1-bound LPL and adjacent heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Using a combination of surface plasmon resonance studies and in vivo GPIHBP1 transport studies, we will test the hypothesis that a crucial function of GPIHBP1's acidic domain is to disrupt interactions between GPIHBP1-bound LPL and nearby HSPGs along the abluminal plasma membrane, thereby freeing LPL to move across endothelial cells to the capillary lumen. Our second specific aim is to explore a recent discovery, using advanced microscopy, that some of the LPL that is transported into capillaries by GPIHBP1 subsequently detaches from GPIHBP1 and enters the HSPG-rich glycocalyx. Taking advantage of super-resolution confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and NanoSIMS imaging, we will characterize GPIHBP1-bound and glycocalyx-bound pools of LPL along capillary endothelial cells. We will also examine the relevance of the glycocalyx-bound LPL to TRL margination along capillaries and TRL processing. Finally, we will develop the tools required to test the relevance of glycocalyx LPL to human disease. We are ideally positioned, with all of the reagents, experimental approaches, and expert collaborators, to address our specific aims. We anticipate that our studies will transform textbook models of intravascular triglyceride metabolism.e metabolism."
10814240,"Adult teleost fish and urodele amphibians can regenerate entire amputated appendages. By contrast,
regenerative healing of adult mammalian limbs is limited to the very tips of digits. One of the key challenges in
developmental biology is to understand how and why tissue regeneration occurs. The hallmark of limb or fin
regeneration is formation of a blastema, a mesenchymal structure that contains progenitor cells for new skeletal
elements. As regeneration proceeds, blastemal cell proliferation and patterning are regulated such that lost
tissues of correct size and shape are replaced. While the catalogue of defined cell dynamics and molecular
factors in tissue regeneration is expanding, we know much less of how genes involved in regenerative events
are engaged upon injury. That is, what are the DNA sequences that recruit activators (or repressors) of gene
programs during tissue regeneration, how are these sequences distributed throughout the genomes of
regeneration-competent animals, and what are the transcription factors that engage with these sequences?
Recently, we identified a class of distal gene regulatory elements that preferentially activate gene expression
during regeneration, can be engineered in simple constructs to express developmental factors that promote
regeneration, and have the potential to be recognized by the transcriptional machinery of distant species. The
overall goal of this proposal is to discover gene regulatory concepts and mechanisms that restore size and
pattern to an amputated appendage. We will test the hypothesis that enhancer and silencer elements are crucial
regulatory modules enabling appendage regeneration in zebrafish. This work will increase understanding of
developmental regulation during vertebrate tissue regeneration, and provide important perspective for
comprehending, and perhaps changing, the existing limitations in regenerative capacity of human tissues."
11091225,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The advent and access to new treatments have made infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) a
chronic disease, allowing patients to have a nearly normal life expectancy. However, the prevalence of chronic
widespread pain (CWP) in individuals infected with HIV is high, ranging from 25% to 85%, despite low viral load
and adequate CD4 count. CWP is one of the most common associated comorbidities of HIV infection and is
associated with high rate of disability and decreased quality of life. However, the specific mechanisms that
contribute to CWP in HIV are not understood. Thus, pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to
mitigate CWP have had minimal benefits, contributing to an overreliance on opioids and alarming rise in addiction
and overdose. The overall objective of this proposal is to address the gap in the knowledge of the pathogenesis
of CWP and identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets to mitigate CWP in HIV. Specifically, we will
explore the role of cell-free heme in impairment of endogenous opioid synthesis/release from peripheral
leukocytes in HIV patients with CWP. Our novel preliminary findings demonstrate that HIV patients who self-
report having CWP have elevated plasma levels of cell-free heme, coupled with decreased leukocyte β-
endorphin levels, relative to HIV patients without CWP. Heme is a pro-inflammatory molecule that can induce
endoplasmic reticulum stress, as well as inhibit function of leukocytes. Heme also promotes the transition of M0
macrophages toward an M1-like pro-inflammatory rather than M2-like proresolution phenotype. Compared to M2
cells, M1 macrophages contain and release lower amounts of opioid peptides. Therefore, we hypothesize that
cell-free heme reduces endogenous opioid peptide-dependent analgesia and enhances pain sensitivity in PWH.
We will accomplish our overall objective by addressing the following specific aims: 1) establish a direct link
between plasma concentration of cell-free heme and peripheral endogenous opioid peptides with quantitative
sensory measures in HIV patients with CWP, 2) to determine in a translational manner the mechanisms through
which heme contributes to diminished peripheral opioid release and pain, and 3) test whether heme scavenging
is a therapeutic option to increase leukocyte endogenous opioids and attenuate pain hypersensitivity. This work
is novel as the impact of endogenous opioid peptide synthesis and release by leukocytes on CWP in HIV has
never before been directly examined. Furthermore, the proposed work is innovative in that it combines clinical
and preclinical experiments, including the use of the HIV-1 transgenic rat model, to identify potential biomarkers
and mechanisms of CWP in HIV. The proposed research is significant because, if our hypotheses are confirmed,
we will identify: 1) heme as a major driver of pain in HIV, and 2) heme scavenging by hemopexin as a novel,
non-opioid therapeutic for HIV-associated pain."
10840370,"Summary
Types 1 and 2 diabetes result entirely or in part from a reduction in numbers of normally functioning pancreatic
beta cells. Residual beta cells are present in most people with diabetes, suggesting that regenerative therapies
may be uniquely helpful. Inducing human beta cells to regenerate has proven impossible until recently. This
has changed with the discovery by several labs of drugs that inhibit the kinase, DYRK1A, and which induce
human beta cells to replicate at “rates”, or more properly, “labeling indices”, of ~2%. Proliferation can be
augmented by combining DYRK1A inhibitors with TGF-beta superfamily inhibitors or with GLP1 receptor
agonists, generating labeling indices of 5-8%. Although these are exciting advances, they also demonstrate
that >90% of human beta cells are recalcitrant to cell cycle entry. The cause of this remarkable refractoriness
to proliferation is poorly understood.
DYRK1A inhibition alters intracellular trafficking of the NFaT family of transcription factors. In the course of our
studies on human insulinomas, we have uncovered a parallel pathway, the DREAM-MMB complex, that also
restricts human beta cell proliferation. We show here that the extended family of ~200 canonical DREAM-MMB
complex genes and proteins appear to be present in human beta cells, and that DREAM complex is switched
from a repressive to a proliferative configuration by DYRK1A inhibition. In addition, we have also observed
potential overlapping roles for Trithorax and Polycomb complexes with the DREAM complex in restraining
human beta cell proliferation. Accordingly, in this application, we propose three Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Complete The Characterization of the Functional DREAM-MMB Complex in the Human Beta Cell.
Aim 2. Delineate Candidate DREAM-MMB Complex Target Genes in the Human Beta Cell.
Aim 3. Aim 3. Define Genome-Wide Integration of Repressive and Proliferative DREAM-MMB Mediators
with Trithorax and Polycomb Chromatin Regulators and DREAM Target Genes in Human Beta Cells.
Our overarching goals are: 1) to clearly and comprehensively define the fundamental mechanisms that enforce
quiescence in the adult human beta cell; 2) to more clearly elucidate the fundamental mechanisms through
which DYRK1A inhibitors, TGFβ inhibitors and GLP1RA’s synergize to induce their remarkable rates of human
beta cell proliferation; and 3) to reveal novel pathways and further expand therapeutic targets for human beta
cell regeneration for diabetes."

As the elderly population increases, the number of people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rising rapidly. There
is, therefore, a growing interest in the development of in vitro human disease models to better understand and
study the physiological and pathological mechanisms associated with AD. Emerging evidence has implicated an
early breakdown of the BBB in AD patients, even before the cognitive decline and brain pathology. In addition,
meningeal lymphatics are responsible for clearance of Aβ peptides from the brain parenchyma, and disruption
of meningeal lymphatics in AD transgenic mice accelerates Aβ deposition in the meninges, aggravates
parenchymal Aβ accumulation, and induces cognitive impairment. Yet, our understanding of the role of fluid
transport across the BBB, through the brain parenchyma, and exiting via the lymphatic system is poorly
understood. Therefore, the development of physiologically realistic human neural cell culture models of AD with
a neurovascular unit and meningeal lymphatic vessels is urgently needed to dissect molecular mechanisms
underlying the pathogenic cascade of AD and accelerate the discovery of new AD drugs. Building on our
extensive set of preliminary and related studies, we propose to develop a three-dimensional (3D) in vitro model
by integrating BBB, meningeal lymphatics, and stem-cell-derived AD cell culture to closely mimic the AD brain
environment. With this model, we aim to identify AD-specific mechanisms underlying pathophysiological changes
in the BBB, meningeal lymphatics, and Aβ clearance. Our 3D AD model will be useful for not only studying the
mechanisms of AD progression but also for drug discovery in a human brain-like environment."

The New York Nutrition Obesity Research Center (NYNORC) Pilot & Feasibility (PF) program provides support
for basic and clinical research projects related to nutritional studies and obesity including its etiology and
complications. Since its inception 40 years ago, this program has been used successfully to 1) attract and
underwrite young investigators who wish to undertake a career in obesity; 2) encourage established investigators
proposing work related to nutrition and obesity, outside of their usual areas of research; 3) promulgate high-risk
projects that expand the NYNORC’s reach into new areas of bioscience deemed likely to have relevance to
aspects of our mission; 4) promote collaborative research projects among Center members and the Cores. Of
the 105 prior recipients, 76 are still in obesity/nutrition academic research, four are in teaching, and eight are in
industry. In the past 10 years, 22 of the recipients have been early investigators and 7 have been established
investigators. To date, these 29 P/F grantees have acquired 44 grants, funded by NIH (n=30), and
nongovernment grants (n=14). The total annual direct costs for these 44 grants are nearly $10.9M. We consider
this program to be among the most important elements of the NYNORC, and have taken steps to increase the

10832500,"Artificial intelligence holds the promise of transforming data-driven biomedical research and computational health informatics for more accurate diagnosis and better treatment at lower cost. In the meantime, modern digital and mobile technologies make it much easier to collect information from patients in large scale. While “big” medical data offers unprecedented opportunities of building deep-learning artificial neural network (ANN) models to advance the research of complex diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), it also presents unique challenges to patient data privacy. The task of training and continuously refining ANN models with data from tens of thousands of patients, each with numerous attributes and images, is computation-intensive and time-consuming. Outsourcing such computation and its data to the cloud is a viable solution. However, the problem of performing the ANN learning operations in the cloud, without the risk of leaking any patient data from their distributed sources, remains open to date. This application proposes to develop novel data masking technologies based on randomized orthogonal transformation to enable AI-computation outsourcing and data sharing, with the following two specific aims: 1) Perform two experimental studies of training ANN models with data masking in the HiperGator cloud for PD prediction and Parkinsonism diagnosis; 2) establish the theoretical foundation on data privacy, inference accuracy, and training performance of the ANN models used in the experimental studies. The interdisciplinary project team combines the expertise from data privacy, biomedical informatics, machine learning, and cloud computing to develop data outsourcing and sharing technologies for AI-powered PD research. The proposed research will remove a major roadblock that restricts medical data accessibility and hinders cloud-based operations of deep-learning artificial neural networks for biomedical research. The outcome is expected to have a broader impact beyond PD research in advancing the theory and implementation of cloud-based medical studies with data privacy protection."
10837808,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Interdisciplinary clinical research on the combined effects of substance abuse and HIV disease on the
central nervous system (CNS) is of considerable public health importance. Despite this, few laboratories
address this critical topic and the current training program is the only one dedicated to preparing the next
generation of investigators to conduct this research. In this proposed second renewal of our NRSA T32
training grant, “Training in Research on Addictions in Interdisciplinary NeuroAIDS (TRAIN),” we aim to
accelerate our contribution to the field. We will continue to recruit talented and diverse pre- and post-
doctoral trainees whose academic development will be furthered by an accomplished multidisciplinary team
of mentors and the extensive academic resources at UC San Diego. TRAIN has been highly successful in
the current funding period–since 2016, the 8 trainees produced 55 research manuscripts (22 first-authored),
88 conference presentations, and 6 book chapters, as well as 2 extramural NIH-funded grants (1 under
review, impact score=21, 2nd percentile), 3 supplements to NIH-funded grants, and 2 intramural pilot grants.
In this second renewal, we plan to enhance our training grant by augmenting faculty expertise, didactics,
and training in new methodologies to support our new complementary theme of the complex biological
mechanisms underlying the CNS consequences of HIV and substance use. Factors of particular focus
include the microbiome and gut brain-axis, systemic and CNS inflammation, neuroimmunology, and
biomarkers. This focus will augment TRAIN continuity themes of neurobehavioral functioning (e.g., frontal
systems behaviors, decision-making, memory) and health-related everyday functioning (e.g., treatment
adherence, vocational outcomes). Given our previous success and the growing demands of the field, we
propose to increase our steady state number of trainees to four pre- and three post-doctoral trainees. Our
students and fellows will be actively engaged in individualized career development plans, such as applied
research training, didactics, and targeted clinical experiences. TRAIN faculty, all with strong training
interests and robust histories of collaborative research, consists of 25 primary mentors across multiple
academic levels and disciplines, with considerable expertise across the aforementioned scientific themes.
We also have made organizational enhancements (e.g., addition of internal TRAIN committees) to further
ensure continued progress towards the accomplishment of trainee goals. TRAIN is led by R. Heaton, Co-
Directors I. Grant and D. Moore (new to this role), and Associate Directors J. Iudicello and E. Morgan; this
team will oversee all training, scientific, and administrative aspects of the program. TRAIN will be housed
at the HNRP-CMCR within the Department of Psychiatry, which is a resource-rich research and training
environment in substance abuse and neuroHIV research. Our central goal remains unchanged: to train,
mentor, and guide the next generation of researchers on combined CNS effects of HIV and substance use."
10868450,"Project Summary/Abstract
Living cells possess the remarkable ability to adapt to changes in their environmental conditions. Adaptation
involves changes in cellular properties in response to external cues in order to regulate vital physiological
functions and processes. While much progress has been made in identifying the molecular components and
biochemical pathways underlying cellular stress response, the role of cellular physical properties in adaptive
stress response is mostly unknown. Our recent studies provide evidence that changes in cell shape and cellular
physical properties promotes adaptive benefits in certain stressful conditions via mechanochemical feedback
processes. The goal of the proposed research is to develop quantitative theory and data-driven computational
models to uncover the biophysical feedback mechanisms underlying cellular adaptive response to environmental
stresses. We will utilize an interdisciplinary approach that integrates tools from statistical physics, systems
biology, and experimental data analysis to construct predictive models for cell behavior. We will specifically
investigate adaptive response in two different biological systems: 1) adaptation to nutrient shifts and antibiotic
stresses in proliferating bacterial cells, and 2) adaptation to energy deprivation and cell state transitions in
nematode worm embryos. In each of these systems we will develop quantitative cell-level models based on
known molecular circuits, intracellular biophysical interactions and dynamics observed in experimental data. The
models will be calibrated and tested against quantitative single-cell data obtained from our experimental
collaborators. The resultant models will help test different experimental hypotheses, isolate and test the relative
roles of biochemical and physical pathways in cellular adaptive response, and pinpoint the main driving forces
behind complex adaptive phenomena. In addition to developing quantitative models for cellular biophysical
behaviors, our study will generate a variety of computational tools that will enable efficient whole-cell simulations
of bacterial growth, morphogenesis, intracellular organization and single-cell development."
10837764,"Much of our knowledge of islet physiology stems from rodent studies. However, we now know that marked
discrepancies exist between rodent and human islets in regard to (for example) architecture, hormone secretion,
and islet cell transcription factor (TF) expression, demonstrating potential limitations in assuming that rodent
models entirely mimic human islet physiology and disease. An example of such a discrepancy lies in the islet β
cell enriched MAFA TF, a fundamentally important protein to these cells in postnatal rodents. Thus, the MAFA
protein is barely detectable in human islet β cells until ~9 years of age, whereas this TF is first detected
developmentally and then produced throughout the lifespan of rodent insulin+ cells. We propose that humans
have at least two postnatal, age-dependent MAFA-producing β cell populations capable of maintaining
euglycemia: juvenile β cells (i.e. <~9 years old) with little MAFA (i.e. MAFALow) and post-juvenile β cells with
robust MAFA (MAFAHigh). In fact, independent studies have established distinct molecular and functional
properties of these human cell populations. Here we will examine the impact of MAFA on human β cells and
hypothesize that this TF plays an essential role in regulating insulin secretion in adults. Our analysis in the first
aim will be conducted using the β-like cells produced from both human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) (collectively termed human pluripotent stem cells, or hPSCs). Here we will
determine how knockout and over-expression of MAFA influences β cell maturation and function, appreciating
that their greatly improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion properties parallel enhanced MAFA expression
after transplantation into immunocompromised NSG mice. In addition, we will investigate how a pathogenic
variant of MAFA (Serine (S) 64 -> Phenylalanine (F)) that prominently increases its protein stability affects human
β cell activity. Notably, MAFAS64F predisposes subjects to either adult-onset diabetes or insulinomatosis (i.e.
non-syndromic insulin-producing β cell tumors) in a gender-biased manner. We generated a mouse model
harboring this mutation in the endogenous MafA gene, and our results show glucose intolerance in males and
improved glucose clearance in females, mimicking the findings in human subjects. Significantly, dysfunction in
male mice was associated with premature cellular aging and senescence. Recently, independent reports have
linked pathologic, senescent β cell populations to type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes islet dysfunction. Our
experimentation in the second aim will define the molecular and functional consequences of MAFAS64F in human
β cells. Our overall focus on human islet cells is viewed as innovative, as well as the combined use of human
stem cell derived β-like cells and human islets for obtaining novel, physiologically relevant mechanistic insights."
10810799,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is an age-related cerebral small vessel disease that is common in
elderly. CAA causes two principle, potentially devastating, outcomes in this population: lobar intracerebral
hemorrhage (ICH) and vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). CAA is characterized by
progressive deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the walls of cortical and leptomeningeal arteries leading to vascular
dysfunction. Vascular dysfunction underlies the lesions of small vessel disease typically seen in CAA such as
lobar microbleeds (MB) and cortical superficial siderosis (cSS). In addition to exhibiting vascular dysfunction, a
significant proportion of CAA patients harbor the amyloid plaques and tau-based neurofibrillary tangles typical
of Alzheimer’s pathology which may also influence disease course.
 Although CAA is often identified in patients after they develop lobar ICH or dementia, neuropathological
and epidemiologic studies suggest that early, yet pathologically advanced pre-clinical forms of CAA are
common. Data generated from this project during the initial funding period have shown that these previously
understudied patients can now be reliably identified with high specificity using MRI-based biomarkers. The
critical next step is to identify modifiable risk factors that may influence early disease course in CAA.
 In contrast to other forms of stroke, modifiable risk factors to prevent CAA-related outcomes have not been
identified. Preliminary evidence suggests that in CAA patients with lobar ICH, elevated mean blood pressure
(BP) predicts increased risk of ICH recurrence. Emerging evidence has linked increased BP variability to
elevated risk of cerebral small vessel disease, stroke and dementia above and beyond the role of mean BP
levels. It is, however, unknown whether BP variability may also contribute to subclinical disease course in CAA
patients. In early CAA patients who do not develop incident ICH, nearly a third develop dementia over 2 years.
Is dementia caused by progressive vascular dysfunction or tau or amyloid pathology in the disease? Our
preliminary data suggests that BP variability influences tau accumulation. The underlying biologic mechanisms
are poorly understood. Using a prospective cohort of patients with CAA without previous history of ICH, we will
answer the following three key questions: 1) Does abnormal BP, characterized by elevated BP level and
variability, increase the risk of bleeding events in patients with early CAA? 2) Does BP affect progression of
CAA-related vascular or tau or amyloid pathology? 3) In patients with early CAA does BP influence
development of cognitive impairment and dementia?"
10770510,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Advances in imaging and fluid-based biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) including amyloid (A), tau (T) and
neurodegeneration (N), allow detection of underlying disease pathology decades before the onset of dementia.
Despite over a decade of AD biomarker research, the field still lacks the ability to accurately predict if and when
individuals with preclinical AD (those with biomarker detectable pathology in the absence of cognitive symptoms)
will experience dementia. Identifying factors that slow or quicken this preclinical timeframe is needed to improve
dementia risk prediction for preclinical AD patients and to inform optimal treatment windows for clinical trials
aiming to slow or prevent cognitive decline and impairment. Until recently, studying these factors was precluded
by observing different people for short periods of time that began studies in different disease stages with no way
to identify when disease began for individual participants. Our team developed and validated new methods that
provide individualized estimated amyloid onset age (EAOA) from amyloid biomarkers. EAOA can be used to
rearrange biomarker and clinical observations along an AD-specific timeline (i.e., an Amyloid Clock) anchored
to the start of preclinical AD. This project will apply this novel approach to existing data from that Washington
University Knight ADRC, the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, the Wisconsin Registry for
Alzheimer’s Prevention, the, the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
to investigate factors across cohorts that influence the timing and trajectories of AD biomarkers and dementia.
This study was initiated based on our preliminary findings showing considerable differences between individuals
and cohorts regarding 1) when amyloid onset occurs, 2) the time between amyloid onset and dementia onset,
and 3) factors that affect AD biomarker and dementia trajectories in AD. In addition, studies from our center and
others have begun to link AD pathology, change in brain volume, and changes in cognition to social determinants
of health (SDoH) like neighborhood disadvantage. However, possible links between SDoH and the timing and
trajectories of AD biomarkers and dementia are not well-understood. Our hypothesis is that observed individual
and cohort differences in AD trajectories are due to a combination of demographic, environmental, sociocultural,
and biologic factors, and study design and sample composition. We will test this overall hypothesis in three
specific aims: 1) identify common factors across multiple cohorts that influence the timing and trajectories of ATN
biomarkers; 2) identify common factors across multiple cohorts that affect the time from amyloid onset to
dementia; and 3) explore inter-cohort differences in AD biomarker and dementia trajectories. This study will
leverage existing data in several well-characterized studies to provide new insights into mechanisms that explain
when preclinical AD begins and how long this preclinical phase lasts. This is expected to improve AD dementia
risk prediction for individuals and identify optimal windows for disease modifying and prevention therapies."
10819230,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In 2020, an estimated 77,240 people in the US will be diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and
19,940 will die from this cancer. NHL incidence rates increased over the last half of the 20th century and only
recently stabilized. In parallel, NHL survival rates began improving in the mid-1990s with the advent of
improved treatment strategies, leading to the current 5-year survival rate of 74%. These trends have led to a
growth in the number of NHL survivors, estimated at over 757,000 in 2019. To address the unmet health
needs of this patient population, we established the Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study,
which by June 2020 will have enrolled over 13,000 NHL patients and have <1% lost to follow-up. The LEO
cohort supports multiple grants and has generated novel and high impact findings on NHL prognosis and
survivorship. To continue and expand the key contributions of LEO, in this renewal we propose to: 1) Extend
recruitment at all 8 LEO centers, with a goal of recruiting 3400 newly diagnosed NHL patients focused on
Hispanic (N=900), African American (N=580), and Asian (N=200) participants (doubling the current sample
size for these groups) and adolescent and young adult (AYA) participants age 18-39 years (N=870; 87%
increase), and non-metro and rural patients of all ages and race/ethnicities (N=1,208, 72% increase), for a total
cohort of 16,500 patients; 2) Review all pathology diagnoses and maintain a NHL tumor bank that includes an
H&E slide, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples in a tissue microarray, and extracted tumor DNA
and RNA; 3) Collect a peripheral blood sample and maintain a central biorepository of DNA, serum, plasma
and buffy coat; 4) Annotate and harmonize all cases with clinical, epidemiologic, pathology and treatment data,
including development of new informatics enhancements to capture clinical data from electronic health records,
digital pathology images and linkage to public databases to enhance data on environmental exposures and
socioeconomic factors; 5) Prospectively follow patients in the cohort to ascertain disease progression/relapse,
retreatment, transformation, second cancers, survival (including cause of death), updated exposures, patient-
reported outcomes (PROs), and other long-term health outcomes; and 6) Facilitate research projects that use
this infrastructure, promote interactions with NCI-supported clinical trials networks, patient advocacy groups,
and other collaborators. We will achieve these aims through close coordination of each of the participating
centers, supported by four cores (Administration; Clinical; Pathology & Biospecimens; and Biostatistics &
Informatics). The LEO cohort is an exceptional resource that supports a broad research agenda aimed at
identifying novel clinical, epidemiologic, germline genetic, tumor, and treatment factors that influence NHL
prognosis and survivorship focusing on NCI research priorities in AYA, minority, and rural populations. LEO is
led by international experts in clinical and epidemiologic research on NHL, thereby driving the translation of
new findings to the clinic and the population."
10811727,"Project Summary
Vascular dysfunction plays a key role in hypertension and cardiovascular disease associated with inactivation of
mitochondrial deacetylase Sirt3, but mitochondria-targeted treatments are not available. Sirt3 inactivation induces
inhibition of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and impairs fatty acid metabolism leading to mitochondrial
oxidative stress and formation of harmful lipid peroxidation products, isolevuglandins (isoLG). We suggest that a feed-
forward cycle between Sirt3 inactivation and mitochondrial isoLG promotes vascular dysfunction and hypertension.
We developed new mitochondria-targeted isoLG scavenger, mito2HOBA, which protects Sirt3 activity and attenuates
hypertension. In this proposal, we will advance this research by defining the novel role of mitochondrial isoLG in
Sirt3 inactivation and vascular dysfunction, and we will establish the therapeutic potential of targeting mitochondrial
isoLG. Our overall objective is to define the specific mechanism of isoLG-mediated Sirt3 inactivation and directly test
the therapeutic potential of targeting mitochondrial isoLG using new transgenic mice, new mitochondria-targeted
drugs, and vascular tissue from patients with essential hypertension. We will pursue the following aims:
AIM 1.Test the hypothesis that inactivation of endothelial Sirt3 induces endothelial dysfunction which is prevented
by targeting mitochondrial isoLG. In this aim we will examine the pathophysiological role of endothelial
 Sirt3 impairment and mitochondrial isoLG in endothelium specific Sirt3 depleted (EcSirt3KO) and wild-type
 male and female mice. We will define the role of Sirt3 inactivation and mitochondrial isoLG in endothelial
 inflammation, cell senescence, endothelial barrier disruption, and impaired relaxation.
AIM 2.Test the hypothesis that inactivation of smooth muscle Sirt3 induces vascular dysfunction, and blocking
mitochondrial isoLG improves vascular function. We will study the role of smooth muscle Sirt3 impairment
 in smooth muscle Sirt3 depleted (SmcSirt3KO) mice. The specific roles of SOD2-K68 acetylation and metabolic
 dysfunction will be tested in available SOD2-deacetylation mimetic SOD2K68R and Sirt3-/--SODK68R mice. The
 role of mitochondrial isoLG in smooth muscle hypertrophy, inflammation and aortic remodeling will be defined.
AIM 3. Determine the therapeutic potential of targeting Sirt3 inactivation and mitochondrial isoLG in mouse models
and human vascular tissue from patients with essential hypertension. We will test (A) if treatment with novel
 mitochondria-targeted isoLG scavengers, such as mito2HOBA, after onset of hypertension increases Sirt3
 activity and improves vascular function in mouse models, and (B) if targeting mitochondrial isoLG in vascular
 tissues from hypertensive human subjects ex vivo reduces inflammation, improves Sirt3 activity, and relaxation.
We are in an ideal position to perform these interdisciplinary studies. We developed new Sirt3 transgenic mouse
models and mitochondria-targeted treatments. We have access to human vascular tissue and unique expertise
in oxidative stress, human vascular studies and hypertension. Our data support this novel pathway in vascular
dysfunction, and this work has the potential to make a major impact on the development of new clinical treatments."
10807105,"Bacteriologists have proposed that numerous stresses are toxic to bacteria because they
stimulate the intracellular production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. In most cases, no
molecular mechanism has been determined, and none is self-evident. Many of these proposals are
based upon data from redox-active fluorescent dyes, which are believed to detect intracellular reactive
oxygen species (ROS). However, those results have not always been supported by other more-direct
methods. This proposal includes preliminary evidence that highlights two concerns about these dyes:
that they can be oxidized by intracellular species other than ROS, and that the amount of dye that loads
into cells can be affected by stress. Aim 1 will systematically test the utility of fluorescein dyes, which
are oxidized by hydroxyl radicals, and ethidine dyes, which react with superoxide. Signals will be
quantified in E. coli strains in which ROS are adjusted over the range of biological relevance. Dye
signals will be normalized to their intracellular concentrations, using a novel technique. The result will
be a rigorous test of their validity as ROS sensors.
 Aim 2 will develop an alternative marker of oxidative stress that is expected to be reliable,
relevant, and accessible to non-experts. Serine dehydratase is a widely distributed enzyme whose
iron-sulfur cluster is converted by oxidants to a unique [3Fe-4S] form that can be diagnosed through
simple in vitro methods. This Aim will optimize these measurements and test whether the enzyme
responds to the levels of ROS that are pertinent in vivo.
 Aim 3 will then investigate two antibiotics whose toxic actions have been proposed to depend
upon intracellular ROS. Streptonigrin is thought to generate toxic amounts of H2O2 through redox-
cycling, with the H2O2 then reacting with drug-bound Fe(II) to produce fatal hydroxyl radicals. However,
an alternative model considered here suggests that redox-cycling may be minimal and free H2O2 may
not participate. Experiments will distinguish between these two hypotheses. Trimethoprim is an
inhibitor of thymine synthesis, and published data indicates that H2O2 can contribute to its lethality.
Authors conjectured that thymine-starved cells produce toxic amounts of H2O2. A different possibility is
that exogenous H2O2 creates DNA damage that thymineless cells struggle to repair. These two sub-
aims introduce several distinct ways in which ROS may drive the action of antibiotics. These concepts
and experimental approaches can guide the analysis of lead compounds whose antibiotic actions are
suspected of involving ROS."
10799623,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite the clinical effectiveness of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) for obstructive sleep apnea
(OSA), patient compliance with the therapy remains a major cause of treatment failure. This chronic sleep-related
breathing disorder that affects 5-10% of the population is associated with various serious adverse outcomes,
including cardiovascular diseases. OSA involves a decrease or complete halt in airflow despite an ongoing
breathing effort. It occurs when muscles relax during sleep, causing soft tissues in the posterior pharynx to
collapse and obstruct the upper airway. CPAP, which is broadly considered first-line therapy for OSA, keeps the
upper airway open with positive airway pressure to prevent airway obstruction by the collapse of the soft tissues.
However, CPAP requires a tight seal between the mask and the patient's face closed system to maintain airway
pressure. Although effective when used consistently, CPAP is not well tolerated by many patients largely due to
the discomfort of the tight-fitting mask of current devices.
A promising new development derives from our recent work based on the re-application of “vortical airflow,” a
flow control mechanism commonly used in aerospace engineering applications. The unique aerodynamic
properties of vortical airflow enable it to pressurize the upper airways without the need for a tight-fitting mask.
The current project is designed to accomplish two critical milestones. First, the current prototype will be advanced
to function as a stand-alone unit with an overall size similar to currently marketed CPAP devices. Second, it will
demonstrate that the nasal interface of the new prototype is more comfortable than CPAP masks."
10994041,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Infants born prematurely (gestational age <32 weeks) are at risk (AR) for cerebral palsy (CP). CP is the most
common pediatric movement disorder and is caused by damage to brain areas during development. Children
with CP have motor and sensory impairments that cause muscle weakness, poor coordination, and difficulty
grasping objects. These impairments prevent functional independence and reduce social participation. How
these impairments arise throughout the course of life is not well understood. This is due in part to a limited
understanding of how sensory and motor systems interact during development to organize brain circuits. The
gap in knowledge is particularly problematic because the timing of motor and sensory brain area establishment
(i.e. during the first year of life) coincides with a period in which the brain is highly plastic. Interventions for
infants with CP are emerging, but little is known about the neural systems that can be targeted to optimize
these novel interventions. We will longitudinally track infant movements and sensory function in relation to
brain development in typically developing infants and infants AR for CP. By characterizing the development of
sensorimotor function and brain activation patterns, we will identify key mechanisms of motor recovery.
Understanding mechanisms of motor and sensory development during this age could provide potential targets
for activity-dependent interventions at a time when the nervous systems is highly malleable. Thus, this project
will provide novel insights aligned with the NINDS mission of advancing fundamental knowledge about the
brain to improve treatments for neurological disease. My long-term goal is to develop a program of research
that uses mechanistic information to develop evidence-based therapies that improve function in infants with
CP. To accomplish this goal, I have developed a rigorous career development plan under the mentorship of an
interdisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in content areas directly related to my training goals. My
career development activities will focus on: 1) obtaining pragmatic professional development experiences to
accelerate my career path, 2) developing expertise in integrated measurements of sensorimotor behavior and
brain activity in infants, and 3) acquiring a strong foundation in clinical design and quantitative analyses for
longitudinal studies. This training will position me to establish an active and rigorous research program that will
advance knowledge and reduce the burden of pediatric brain disorders."
10827378,"Project Summary. A fundamental function of the nervous system is to distinguish between threatening and non-
threatening stimuli. For example, a sudden intense sound that indicates danger should trigger an acoustic startle
response, but an innocuous sound should not. This type of behavioral threshold is a basic mechanism for
sensorimotor filtering, and the importance of setting this threshold appropriately is highlighted by the startle
hypersensitivity observed in neuropsychiatric diseases such as autism, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Despite its
importance, and in contrast to our knowledge of experience-dependent startle modulation, the molecular and
cellular pathways that establish and maintain the innate startle threshold are not well characterized. By
developing a more complete understanding of the biological mechanisms that govern the startle threshold, we
can generate new hypotheses about the neural bases for these diseases. This project will leverage the powerful
larval zebrafish model system to investigate the molecular-genetic and neural circuit bases of the startle
threshold. Here a simple, conserved, and genetically accessible circuit drives a stereotyped startle response,
with auditory afferents triggering reticulospinal neurons to activate motor neurons and initiate movement. In a
recent genome-wide screen, we identified a novel regulator of the innate startle threshold: cytoplasmic Fragile X
mental retardation protein (FMRP) interacting protein 2 (cyfip2). cyfip2 mutants are hypersensitive and startle to
low intensity sounds that rarely startle wild-types. Cyfip2 acts through FMRP and eIF4E to regulate RNA
translation, but it can also control actin polymerization through interactions with Rac1 and the WAVE regulatory
complex (WRC). In Aim 1 we will systematically test which of these molecular pathways cyfip2 uses to establish
the startle threshold and to maintain it through development. In Aim 2 we will define the cellular basis for cyfip2-
mediated threshold control by first locating the site of the primary circuit defect with optogenetic and calcium
imaging approaches and then identifying the cell types in which cyfip2 is needed for normal startle sensitivity.
Finally, our data show that acute manipulation of the actin cytoskeleton substantially alters the startle threshold
while also decreasing the number and size of excitatory synapses in inhibitory glycinergic neurons but not
excitatory glutamatergic neurons. In Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that cyfip2 acts cell-autonomously to
maintain excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance, combining behavioral recording with live imaging of neuronal
activity and synaptic scaffolds to define direct links between cyfip2, circuit structure and function, and behavior.
Overall, the results of this work will generate a detailed model of molecular and cellular pathways that control
the startle behavior threshold and lay a foundation for understanding how these may be affected in human
disease."
10832975,"Project Summary
Large-scale recordings are discovering that individual neurons in sensory, cognitive, and motor networks often
participate variably, even when presented with identical inputs. The reason for such variability is unclear, and
an active topic of debate in the field. Does it reflect randomness in neuronal participation, or is it an adaptive
feature that plays an essential role in healthy brain function? The scientific premise of this application is the
latter—that variably participating neurons reflect the operation of a “focusing” mechanism innate to many
networks that allows them to rapidly and flexibly rearrange which neurons are called upon to process specific
information in the context of the moment.
This hypothesis emerged unexpectedly from our large-scale recordings of the rhythmic escape swim network of
the marine mollusk Tritonia diomedea. We were surprised to discover that during the initial seconds of
responding to an unexpected aversive sensory input, Tritonia's swim motor program rapidly tunes itself, pulling
many initially-silent neurons into the bursting population and driving others out, apparently optimizing itself for
escape. In this Tritonia case, the “focused” state is then maintained for several minutes, enabling a stronger,
faster-onset motor program should the same stimulus recur. Many studies in vertebrates have reported rapid
growth in the size of responding networks with repeated stimulation, but the mechanisms and purpose of such
phenomena are poorly understood.
This project's goal is to uncover the mechanisms underlying what may be an important versatility process for
healthy function in many brain networks—one that allows them to rapidly re-allocate neurons to suit a specific
context, and then hold that focused state for a sustained period of time. The project has 2 Specific Aims: Aim
1 will map the re-allocating neurons and address several issues regarding the phenomenology of this poorly
understood network focusing process. Aim 2 will determine the cellular mechanisms driving the rapid re-
allocation of neurons into and out of the bursting escape swim network as it focuses. The principles of rapid
network focusing to be investigated here may promote novel approaches for treating or preventing declines in
cognitive function in aging and disease."

Researchers in HIV/TB Diagnostics in Mali” (B-NextGen), is to strengthen the scientific capacity at the
Université des Sciences, Téchniques et des Téchnologies de Bamako (USTTB; University of Bamako) to
conduct HIV research on the evolving HIV epidemic in Mali. B-NextGen will address four NIH high priority HIV
research topics, including: 1) Reducing HIV incidence by improving screening and detection,
treatment monitoring assays, and HIV drug resistance assays; 2) Diagnosing HIV-associated TB and non-
tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM); 3) Reducing health disparities by developing testing technology that can
function in underserved community settings; and 4) Training the LMIC workforce to conduct high
priority HIV/AIDS research. Mali is a low-income country in Sub-Saharan West Africa where the incidence of
mycobacterial infections, primarily tuberculosis (TB), remains high driven in a large part by the persistence of
the HIV epidemic with TB being the main cause of dealth in HIV-infected adults and children. The World Health
Organization (WHO) guidelines for managing HIV recommend rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART)
and enhanced screening and diagnosis of TB, yet detection rates for HIV and TB, particularly in children,
remain low in Mali as the current diagnostic and treatment monitoring tools are not adapted to the low- and
middle-income (LMIC) environment. Northwestern University, Johns Hopkins University, and Stellenbosch
University, have been successfully collaborating with USTTB for over a decade on several major projects
focused on HIV and mycobacterial diseases including the predecessor to this renewal proposal “HIV and
Mycobacterial Disease in Mali” (R Murphy, S Diallo, MPIs), which has been highly productive providing three
“sandwich” PhD and ten MS degrees; > 200 short-term university diplomas; 25 peer-reviewed publications;
and four major NIH grant awards. We will train the same number of researchers in this renewal proposal while
we leverage this success to focus on outcome indicators of high public health importance. Our aims are: 1)
Create a Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Mali National School of Engineering and establish a
Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering focused on the development of devices and assays critical for the
diagnosis and/or monitoring of HIV and mycobacterial diseases; 2) Develop an interdisciplinary core of
research scientists from virology, applied molecular biology, immunology and microbiology to enhance the
capacity to diagnose, treat, and monitor HIV and mycobacterial diseases; 3) Train clinical researchers and
basic scientists in research methodology, validation and implementation applied principles, and career
development activities essential for developing independent faculty; and 4) Develop the next generation of
academic leaders in diagnostics, virology and mycobacteriology. Through this program, we will achieve the
overall goal of training the next generation of investigators and leaders in diagnostics of HIV and mycobacterial
diseases for adults and children in Mali."

Hematopoietic malignancies including leukemias and lymphomas contribute to nearly half of all cancers and
are a major cause of death from disease in children. The Children’s Oncology Group (COG) has spearheaded
efforts to improve outcome in children with cancer, and despite dramatic improvements in survival over the last
several decades, relapse remains a major problem, and survivors may suffer long term complications from the
cytotoxic therapy. Better understanding of the biology of malignancies allows for more rational, targeted
approaches to therapy, minimizing the need or the intensity of the non-selective cytotoxic therapies. Such
targeted approaches have transformed some diseases from uniformly fatal to highly curable ones (e.g., CML,
APL), but a paucity of actionable targets has prevented broader application of targeted interventions in
hematopietic malignancies. As part of its focus on optimizing the survival in pediatric cancers and improving
quality of life for the cancer survivors, COG through partnerships with NCI has conducted a number of
discovery phase studies to identify the biologic basis of cancer in children, with the goal of identifying specific
targets for more appropriate risk stratification and directed therapies in its clinical trials. With the emerging data
from pediatric (and adult) discovery phase studies, COG is poised to take the next step in identifying actionable
targets for therapeutic intervention. As part of these efforts, COG has created the Network Group Integrated
Translational Science Centers (ITSCs) aimed at providing resources for therapeutically driven translational
research. COG Hematopoietic ITSC (HM-ITSC) has put into place intellectual (leadership) and physical
resources (resource laboratories, biospecimens, etc.) to ensure rapid identification of actionable targets
through carefully designed translational research projects, and fostering the experimental data through a
carefully structured mechanism to clinical application. HM-ITSC is structured and integrated into the functional
operations of the COG, with direct links to the COG Operations Office, Disease Committees, Network group
Data and Statistics Center and Developmental Therapeutics in order to facilitate rapid flow of actionable
translational biology data to clinical implementation within NCTN clinical trials. Hematopoietic Malignancies
(HM) are a major cause of cancer in children and novel therapeutic targets are needed to optimize outcome.
COG HM-Integrated Translational Science Center, integrated into the functional organization of COG, will
provide resources to support translational research in pediatric leukemias and lymphomas towards
identification of clinically meaningful targets and their incorporation into clinical trials."
10814405,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) represents a group of aggressive blood cancers derived from mature T
cells, and remains as a high unmet clinical need with poor prognosis and lack of standards of care and
effective treatment. Recent exome sequencing in PTCL patients has unveiled a frequent co-occurrence of
mutations in an epigenetic modifier (TET2) and a small GTPase (RHOA). This discovery heralds the advent of
a molecular era in the dissection of novel pathogenic mechanisms underlying T cell lymphoma. The PI has
shown that genetic depletion of murine Tet2 alone in blood cells causes biased differentiation of hematopoietic
stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) toward the myeloid lineage, but is insufficient to cause lymphoid neoplasms.
A second hit, such as RHOA-G17V frequently found in PTCL, is required to promote full-blown malignancies.
To meet the immediate need for animal models of PTCL, The PI has generated a genetically modified rodent
model mimicking the PTCL-associated genotype with genetic lesions in both TET2 and RHOA. This transgenic
mouse model is well suited to study PTCL because it developed T cell lymphoma in peripheral lymphoid
organs and recapitulated hallmark phenotypes as seen in PTCL patients. These exciting findings laid a strong
scientific foundation to hypothesize that: co-existing TET2 and RHOA mutations in CD4 T cells contribute to
the pathogenesis of PTCLs by
(i)
impairing DNA hydroxymethylation and gene transcription to predispose T
cells for pre-malignant status (Aim 1; with a mechanistic emphasis on R-loop accumulation and aberrant RNA
polymerase II pausing in key genes involved in phosphoinositide metabolism), and
(ii)
disrupting the Rho
GTPase signaling to abnormally activate pro-oncogenic pathways for malignant transformation (Aim 2; with a
prioritized focus on the PI3K/Akt signaling). The team has presented compelling evidence in pilot studies that
lends strong support to the central hypotheses and the feasibility of our approach. Technical innovations
include a unique mouse model that reflects the PTCL-associated genotype and disease hallmarks, as well as a
set of novel molecular tools tailored for precise epigenome mapping/editing and optogenetic control of small
GTPase signaling. These tools allow the team to overcome a major impediment to studies of epigenotype-
phenotype causal relations in pre-malignant and malignant T cells. This research is also conceptually
innovative as it introduces a previously underappreciated dimension for studying the epigenetic regulatory
mechanisms, as well as aberrant GTPase signaling, that drive lymphomagenesis. The proposed studies will
likely illuminate how somatic mutations in epigenetic and GTPase signaling pathways cooperatively contribute
to the initiation, transformation and progression of lymphoma. From a translational perspective, the findings
may reveal novel molecular targets and pathways for therapies against lymphoma."

Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), or the movement of one proton and one electron simultaneously, is an
increasingly important element in synthetic methodology. While nature has made extensive use of HAT steps in
processes such as those performed by desaturase and mutase enzymes, synthetic chemists are just beginning
to realize the potential of this powerful, radical transformation. This MIRA proposal describes two important new
areas enabled by HAT that the PI will explore over the next 5 years: modular radical hydrogenation and
transpositional functionalization. The PI is prepared to make an impact in this important field from his mentored
career, where he designed catalytic dehydrogenation and dehydroformylation systems functioning via HAT. The
first area of research concerns development of a modular, stereoselective hydrogenation system able to
completely control the configuration and isotopic composition at each reduced center (Project 1). Preliminary
work by the PI has demonstrated radical hydrogenation can be achieved using cooperative hydrogen atom
transfer (cHAT), a mechanism where each hydrogen atom arrives from a separate catalyst, allowing for each
catalyst to be modified independently. One goal of this project is independent stereocontrol of each new
stereocenter though use of two asymmetric catalysts (Project 1a). This design will allow for enantioselective anti-
reduction, a currently impossible transformation. A simultaneous, independent goal builds on preliminary data
showing each catalyst receives its hydrogen atom from an orthogonal source, permitting different isotopes to be
predictably delivered in the same reaction (Project 1b). Together, this project area will provide a method to install
H, D, or T in any configuration starting from an unsaturated bond, selecting between all possible isotopologues
and stereoisotopomers via catalyst and reagent control. The second research area focuses on the development
of new mustase-like reactions, where functionality is regioselectively transposed in a 1,2-fashion to remodel
molecular architectures (Project 2). However, unlike mutase enzymes, these methods will exchange the
functional group during the transposition, allowing rapid diversification of complex molecules. Preliminary data
from the PI demonstrates this principle using vitamin B12 and Co(Salen) cocatalysts to achieve “remote
elimination”, where primary alkyl electrophiles are translated into a 2-alkenes with terminal methyl group. We
anticipate this approach will be general, allowing for transpositional C–X, C–N, C–O, and C–C bond-forming
reactions (Project 2a). In parallel, the ability of vitamin B12 to enantioselectively convert meso-epoxides and
aziridines to allylic alcohols and amines will be used to achieve enantioselective C–H functionalization of the
epoxides and aziridines (Project 2b). Together, the proposed research will leverage the unique reactivity of HAT
to deliver a suite of new catalytic reactions both making -and using- olefins to streamline the synthesis of
molecules important to human health."

Changes in the copy number of large genomic regions, termed copy number variations or CNVs, contribute to
phenotypic diversity and facilitate important processes such as host range and drug resistance. Despite decades
of CNV research, many questions regarding their formation and dynamics remain unanswered. Due to distinctive
genome characteristics, facile in vitro propagation, and the relative simplicity of CNV formation, Plasmodium
falciparum is an exceptional model to study many aspects of CNV-based adaptation. Experimental evolution
demonstrates how this haploid asexual parasite rapidly acquires CNVs in the form of tandem duplications. By
studying the junctions of these CNVs, we have identified the precise genome characteristics that contribute to
their formation in this organism; A/T-rich features of the genome both trigger DNA breakage and facilitate
subsequent error-prone repair. Based on this finding, we hypothesize that the extreme AT content of the P.
falciparum genome (>80%) specifically contributes to its highly adaptive nature. We aim to explore this
hypothesis using different human-infective Plasmodium species, which have genomes exhibiting a range of AT-
content (differing by >20% overall and ~30% in intergenic regions). To do so, we will generate highly accurate
genome assemblies to characterize CNV junctions and the sequences that lead to their formation. We will identify
genome features that contribute to DNA breakage and CNV formation in vivo. We will measure the frequency of
novel CNV generation, under both basal and stressed conditions. These proposed studies will facilitate our
creation of a genomic map of adaptive potential for different malaria species, provide firm evidence for our model
of CNV formation, and define constraints influencing CNV evolution. This knowledge, and the novel methods
developed during this project, will pave the way to developing approaches to limit CNV-based adaptation in
diverse microorganisms, cancers, and other cell types under rapid evolution."

Pathological alcohol-seeking behavior is regulated in part by glutamate AMPA receptor (AMPAR)
activity in the amygdala. Transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) profoundly
affect the trafficking and function of AMPARs in synaptic and behavioral plasticity. Although the
TARP family of proteins is expressed throughout the brain, the TARP γ-8 subtype is restricted to
forebrain regions including the basolateral amygdala (BLA); a brain region that is critical to
addiction. However, the role of TARP γ-8 in alcohol use disorders (AUD) or other addictions is
unknown. To fill this gap in knowledge, we propose an innovative set of behavioral, genetic,
bidirectional systemic and site-specific pharmacological, molecular, and physiological studies in
mice to evaluate the mechanistic role of TARP γ-8 in alcohol reinforcement, escalated self-
administration, and cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior as a model of relapse.
Elucidating the neural mechanisms of these three critical behavioral domains has high
translational value for understanding the development, progression, and maintenance of AUD.
Successful completion of the studies in this application will provide fundamental mechanistic
insights into TARP γ-8 regulation of pathological alcohol-seeking behavior. Moreover, this work
moves the field forward in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which alcohol hijacks
reward processes and has potential to inform development of new pharmacotherapeutic
strategies that target AMPAR function in a highly selective brain region-specific manner."

Obesity is characterized by systemic lipid accumulation, inflammation, and enhanced tumorigenesis in different
tissues, including colon. With obesity, intracellular lipid droplets (LDs) are accumulated in fat storing and non-fat
storing tissues. These organelles are increased in colonic tumors relative to normal tissues and may be one the
explanation for how obesity facilitates colonic tumorigenesis. As obesity is becoming a worldwide epidemic, it is
more important than ever to elucidate the tumorigenic processes mediated by LDs dynamics (lipogenesis and
lipolysis). This will provide conceptual advances in our understanding of how obesity promotes inflammatory
colonic tumorigenesis, and it will drive exploration of critical mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming within
tumorigenesis necessary for the development of effective treatment options.
We identified a self-reinforcing negative regulatory loop of LDs with the FOXO3 transcription factor involving
signaling between transcriptional and metabolic pathways that facilitates colonic inflammation and
tumorigenesis. In the proposed project, we will investigate how this regulatory network is reinforced through
acyltransferases 1/2 (DGATs) mediated lipogenesis in facilitating tumorigenesis in obesity. Our preliminary data
show that DGATs levels are elevated in human and mouse colonic tumors relative to normal (with even higher
levels in obese individuals and HFD-obese mice). Elevated DGAT2 transcripts are linked to poor patient survival.
This increase in DGATs levels also promotes LDs utilization through adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). The
expression of DGATs is induced by obesity and inflammatory mediators in colonic cells and is possibly regulated
by Myc that is also activated in the colon of FOXO3 deficient and HFD-obese mice. Inhibition of DGATs in human
colonic transformed cells blocks the pathway responsible for loss of FOXO3 (PI3K), lowers LDs/ATGL, and
attenuates cell growth. We hypothesize that elevated DGATs drive an LD and FOXO3 self-reinforcing loop,
blockade of which effectively shuts down this metabolic inflammatory and tumorigenic pathway. Establishing this
novel mechanism will have diagnostic and therapeutic significance in colonic tumorigenesis, especially those
driven by inflammatory obesity. The proposed project will elucidate DGATs-mediated metabolic mechanisms
stimulating colonic cell growth (Aim 1), it will identify the impact of targeting DGATs in attenuating colonic
tumorigenesis (driven by mutation and inflammation in HFD-obesity) and the associated remodeling of the
immune cell landscape (PMN, MF), molecular pathways (Myc, PI3K), and transcriptome (Aim 2), and it will
assess the significance of the DGAT-dependent LD dynamics in human colonic tumorigenesis (advanced,
inflammatory, and obesity-associated tumors) of local and TCGA patients (Aim 3).
These investigations will provide key mechanistic insights into DGAT-mediated transcriptional and metabolic
reprograming in colonic tumorigenesis and establish a solid platform for the development of novel effective
pharmacological treatments for colonic inflammation, tumorigenesis, and other HFD-related disorders."

The inability to generate effective cell-mediated immunity outside the context of live virus vaccination continues
to be a pervasive clinical problem for vaccination of immunocompromised individuals, cell-mediated prophylaxis
of viral diseases for which no live vaccines exist, and critically, the generation of durable antitumor immune
responses. Cell mediated immunity is initiated by dendritic cells (DC), a critical lineage of innate immunity that
serves as the principal point of contact and crosstalk between the innate and adaptive arms of the immune
system. Successful response to pathogen requires that DC detect and integrate a broad array of environmental
cues to exact control over critical downstream responses, particularly T-helper (TH) cell polarization. Many such
cues, as well as mechanisms of detection and integration, remain to be understood. In this proposal we will
interrogate the emerging but well-supported hypothesis that DC expression of the novel regulator AIMp1 drives
physiologic propagation of TH1 cellular immunity. This hypothesis is based upon extensive and rigorous data
demonstrating that genetic ablation of AIMp1 produces deficits in TH1 polarization significantly more profound
than those characterized in IL-12 or IL-12R-deficient mice. AIMp1 knockout mice lose the ability to mount an
adaptive immune response against influenza, exhibiting complete lethality to a normally sublethal challenge,
deficient HA-specific IgG2a production, and loss of nearly all IFN-g-secreting T-cells in the lung by post-infection
day 15. AIMp1-/- animals also exhibited complete loss of antitumor immunity that could be rescued by adoptive
transfer of wildtype DC. Mechanistically, the data suggest these deficits are due to defective p38MAPK activation
in AIMp1-/- DC with downstream dysregulation of AP-1 heterodimerization. Direct relevance of AIMp1 to human
disease was validated through a pan-cancer TCGA bioinformatics analysis of 9,000 primary human tumor sam-
ples, revealing an unexpected 70% survival advantage among patients expressing elevated levels of AIMp1 in
the primary tumor. In this dataset, elevated AIMp1 expression was highly correlated with an activated DC gene
signature and TH1 immune profile. Strikingly, this survival advantage was not recapitulated among patients in
which the primary tumor exhibited high levels of IL-12A (p35) expression. These data suggest an unrecognized
yet indispensable role for DC-expressed AIMp1 in adaptive TH1 governance and provide a cogent rationale for
this study: confirmation that a novel regulatory factor is essential for integration and transduction of TH1-inducing
signals in DC will alter the paradigm by which TH1 immune signaling is presently understood. The mechanisms
through which AIMp1 governs cellular immunity will be determined by the completion of three specific aims. In
aim I we will define the in vivo DC subset(s) for which AIMp1 function is critical to propagation of TH1 immunity.
In aim II we will define the manner by which AIMp1 interfaces with the DC regulatory signaling cascade. In aim
III we will define deficits in effector cell function that result from conditional loss of AIMp1 in DC populations. In
all aims, differences between AIMp1-deficiency and IL-12 deficiency will be characterized where appropriate."

Intracellular delivery plays an essential role in biological research and therapeutic applications, however, efficient
intracellular delivery of exogenous compounds and macromolecular cargo remains a long-standing challenge.
The complex mechanisms of established methods and their often unpredictable impact on cell behaviour have
dramatically limited the scope of biological experiments and reduced efficacy of potentially promising cell therapy
concepts. Membrane disruption-based approaches have emerged as key strategies for rapid, direct and
universal intracellular delivery because they are less dependent on cargo properties and cell types, being able
to deliver almost any submicron material dispersed in solution. The ability to rapidly switch membrane-perturbing
effects on and off provides an additional level of control, enabling temporal manipulation and rapid, almost
instantaneous delivery. However, key challenges of membrane disruption strategies have been: 1) inconsistent
level of plasma membrane injury (which would lead to low viability and efficiency); 2) poor throughput or
scalability (e.g. microinjection); and 3) inadequate understanding of plasma membrane disruption and recovery
response. The PI's research group at University of Colorado Boulder centers on interdisciplinary research at the
frontiers of Biology, Medicine, Physics, and Micro/Nano Engineering. The main research thrust in the PI's group
is to develop new technologies to quantitatively understand cell membrane disruption and recovery, and explore
its application for next generation precise intracellular drug delivery. The goals for the next five years are to i)
develop a novel microfluidic platform, including NanoEngineered Surface Technology and Acoustofluidic devices,
that can precisely generate uniform and homogenous disruptions at cell membrane with controllable number and
size of the pores, to quantitatively understand cell membrane disruption and recovery dynamics at molecular,
cellular, proteiomic and high throughput level; ii) demonstrate a precise intracellular drug delivery system with
controllable dose, minimum toxicity, maximum efficiency, and high throughput, providing insight for or promoting
the next generation intracellular drug delivery. So far, biologists have not applied the fundamental insights
gleaned from membrane disruption and repair studies toward engineering cell permeability. The proposed
research grogram will bridge the scientific gap between these two disparate fields: the engineering of intracellular
delivery approaches; and the cellular mechanobiology of plasma membrane disruption and repair response. The
biomedical research community would benefit greatly from a more mechanistic and transparent understanding
of intracellular delivery, both to further the development of more robust techniques and to realize key medical
and industrial applications.

 The goal of this proposal is to establish whether decreasing fatty acid-binding protein 7 (FABP7)
expression ameliorates motor neuron degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) models. The FABPs
belong to a family of small (~15kDa) and widely expressed intracellular proteins. All FABPs exhibit high affinity
reversible binding of saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids as well as other lipids. FABPs have been
considered biologically silent chaperones of fatty acids, but it has now become clear that the FABPs are central
regulators of lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis and inflammation. FABPs participate in fatty acid
metabolism regulating their uptake and transport but can also regulate signaling processes by distributing
and/or sequestering ligands for nuclear receptors such as peroxisome proliferator activated receptors
(PPARs). FABP7 (also known as brain lipid binding protein, BLBP) is expressed in neural stem cells
throughout development and its expression decreases and becomes restricted to astrocytes and radial-like
glial cells in the adult central nervous system. Reactive astrocytes up-regulate FABP7 expression in multiple
pathological conditions. To effectively transport and donate bound ligands, FABPs display affinities in the same
range or slightly weaker than those exhibited by PPARs. However, up-regulation of FABPs expression can
create a “sink effect”, negatively regulating the availability of endogenous ligands for PPARs (i.e., increased
intracellular levels of FABPs will result in decreased PPARs activation). PPARs govern the expression of
genes involved in coordinating metabolic and inflammatory pathways in the cell. Thus, decreased PPAR
activity can contribute to altered lipid-mediated signaling and NF-kB activation, two prominent features of ALS-
astrocytes. Our data show for the first time that FABP7 up-regulation may be responsible for the decreased
PPAR activity and concomitant increase in NF-kB activity in ALS-astrocytes. Using cell culture and mouse
models we will evaluate the hypothesis that decreasing FABP7 expression should restore normal activity of
these two interconnected networks and can potentially provide protection against astrocyte-mediated motor
neuron death in ALS models."

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) establish the rules of the genetic code, whereby each amino acid is
attached to a cognate tRNA. Errors in this process lead to mistranslation, which can be toxic to cells. Recent
studies suggest that the selective forces exerted by cell-specific requirements and environmental conditions
potentially shape quality control mechanisms. Approximately half of the ARSs possess a proofreading (or editing)
function to hydrolyze mischarged aa-tRNAs and evidence that non-proteinaceous amino acids pose the greatest
threat to fidelity is beginning to emerge. Early work in the Musier-Forsyth lab in the field of translational quality
control focused on our discovery of Class II prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) editing. This led to a detailed
mechanistic understanding of the novel bacterial ProRS posttransfer editing domain (INS) and the demonstration
that the INS domain, when purified on its own outside the context of the ARS, was fully functional in tRNA
deacylation. We subsequently discovered that single-domain INS homologs are widespread in Bacteria and in
recent years, our focus in this area has turned almost entirely to understanding the function of these INS-like
domains in tRNA editing. However, many open questions regarding the physiological function of these putative
trans-editing proteins remain. The overarching goal of the research described in this MIRA application is to
uncover the specific functions of a growing family of trans-editing proteins known as the INS superfamily. This
diverse yet universally conserved family now has a solid and accumulating in vitro structure-function knowledge
base, which strongly supports a role in maintaining translational fidelity. Our knowledge of the broader
physiological roles of these proteins, especially in eukaryotes, is still in its infancy and is just beginning to reveal
wider roles than previously anticipated. This major gap will be addressed in this work. While classical knock-
down screens that only define essential versus non-essential genes do not immediately identify editing domains
as essential, the strong conservation of these domains implies they play important, and in most cases still
undiscovered, roles in cell survival and competitiveness. Proposed studies are designed to address some of the
many open questions with regard to both physiological trans-editing functions and potential moonlighting
functions of the INS superfamily. These domains are largely unexplored in eukaryotes, including a novel sub-
family cluster that is encoded in many unicellular eukaryotic pathogens. The therapeutic potential of trans-editing
domains has not been exploited and represents another major gap in the field that we hope to address by our
planned studies. In the long term, combining drugs that target novel translational fidelity mechanisms along with
known ribosome-targeting protein synthesis inhibitors such as aminoglycosides, may results in more effective
therapeutic strategies."

Eukaryotic genome duplication requires that each chromosomal base pair is copied efficiently,
accurately and only once per cell division, a monumental demand given the millions to billions of
base pairs that comprise eukaryotic genomes and the countless cell divisions required to form
and sustain organisms. Severe defects in DNA replication are incompatible with life. However,
mild perturbations in this process, while still capable of supporting cell division, and which can
be challenging to identify using biochemical approaches, can compromise development and
health over the course of multiple cell divisions. Regulation of the first step, the initiation of DNA
replication that occurs at chromosomal positions called origins, is particularly critical in
eukaryotic cells because their chromosomes require multiple spatially and temporally distributed
origins for accurate and efficient duplication. Perturbations in origin number or distribution can
promote cancer, stem cell aging, or developmental disorders. While the origin-binding proteins
and molecular steps that define an origin are known, the mechanisms that regulate
chromosomal origin number and distribution are unclear. A challenge is that chromatin
heterogeneity exists across chromosomes as an intrinsic part of genome functional
organization. Thus, the origin-binding proteins must work sufficiently enough within distinct
chromatin environments to achieve a level of origin distribution that balances the competing
demands for cell proliferation and genome stability. Dr. Fox's lab addresses the gaps in
understanding how native chromatin structures regulate origin function by combining rigorous
genetics and genomics to reveal chromatin-mediated mechanisms that impinge on the structure
and function of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) origins. Emphasis is placed on the first step
of origin formation, the origin licensing reaction, which occurs in G1-phase of the cell cycle that
precedes the S-phase where origins perform their actual function, unwinding of the parental
DNA for new DNA synthesis. Accumulating evidence reveals that the licensing step is
particularly relevant to both genome stability and cell-fate decisions, but there is a paucity of
molecular mechanisms regarding how it is regulated in vivo to achieve chromosomal origin
distribution. Evolutionary conservation of the origin-binding proteins and multiple features of
chromatin allow the Fox laboratory to leverage the experimental strengths of yeast to define
fundamental mechanisms by which chromatin and the origin-binding proteins collaborate to form
and distribute origins over the genome.

10814379,"Anti-estrogen therapy is key to the prevention and treatment of estrogen receptor (ER, ESR1) positive breast
cancer, but therapy resistance occurs in up to a half of cases resulting in incurable advanced disease. We
recently reported recurrent ESR1 fusions in advanced endocrine-resistant breast cancers, with loss of ligand
binding representing a canonical model of drug resistance. Intriguingly, cases with ESR1 fusions co-occurred
with ESR1 base-pair mutations, likely pointing towards convergent evolution under prolonged anti-estrogen
therapy. Evidence from our group and others suggest that ESR1 fusions are found in ~10-20% of advanced
breast cancers, however, many ESR1 fusions harbor different 3’ partner genes, making detection challenging.
To determine prevalence, we will comprehensively re-analyze the ESR1 genomic locus in data from metastatic
breast cancers. Further, we have developed and optimized a target capture sequencing assay capable of
comprehensively detecting ESR1 fusions in both tumor biopsies and ctDNA. We have identified endogenous
ESR1 fusions that are expressed in two patient derived xenografts (PDX) (ESR1-LPP and ESR1-NFkB) and in
an ER-positive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-435 (ESR1-SYNE1). We will express ESR1 fusions in recently
generated patient-derived organoids (PDO) which show ER expression and response to estrogen that is equal
or greater than traditional cell lines. Intriguingly, different ESR1 fusions show stark differences in activity,
implicating a role for the 3’ gene partner in modulating activity of the ESR1 N terminal domain (NTD). The NTD
is an intrinsically disordered protein within the transactivation domain, and using a novel integrative-biophysics
approach, we recently reported that while it is mostly disordered, it can adopt an unexpectedly compact
conformation which in turn directs interaction with coregulators. In this proposal we seek to test the hypothesis
that ESR1 fusions are key mediators of endocrine-resistance and breast cancer mortality. We will employ
EnRich to determine the prevalence of ESR1 fusions (and point mutations) in national and international clinical
cohorts of advanced endocrine resistant breast cancer and monitor when they arise during therapy using
longitudinal collection of plasma and ctDNA analyses. We will use patient-derived organoid models of breast
cancer to compare and contrast the activity and function of ESR1 fusions and point mutations relative to wild-
type ER and translate this into in vivo patient derived organoid xenograft (PDOX) and (PDX) models to assess
endocrine resistance. We will study mechanism of action, including the effects on DNA binding and
transcriptional activity, and the role of the 3’ partner gene in any gain of function activities. Finally, we will
examine the structure-function of ESR1 fusions focusing on the NTD and determining the altered structure in
the context of the fusion partner before assessing the function of specific NTD amino acids and how they
change structure and subsequent target gene expression. We believe our multi-disciplinary studies will provide
mechanistic insight to aid in the development of new therapies against breast cancers with ESR1 fusions."

 This proposal seeks to investigate the analgesic and anti-craving efficacy of Cannabidiol (CBD) for
comorbid opioid use disorder (OUD) and chronic pain. Chronic pain afflicts approximately 70% of people with
OUD. Opioid agonist treatment effectively reduces opioid use overdose deaths, but does not alleviate chronic
pain. Convergent preclinical studies have shown that cannabinoids reduce pain sensitivity and opioid-seeking
behavior, suggesting they could be leveraged for treatment. Yet, the therapeutic efficacy of cannabinoids for
comorbid OUD and chronic pain remains unknown. Given CBD’s lack of hedonic properties and established
analgesic and anti-craving effects, it holds particular therapeutic promise for this population.
 Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) is a computerized pain assessment method used to reliably
measure antinociception and predict the pain treatment response. QST pain biomarkers can be integrated with
behavioral paradigms to investigate the two-pronged efficacy of CBD for alleviating pain sensitivity and cue-
induced opioid craving. The objective of this proposal is to apply behavioral pharmacology, multimodal pain
research and clinical trial methods to study the safety and therapeutic efficacy of CBD for people with comorbid
OUD and chronic pain. This will have a significant impact for this patient population, by (i) determining the
safety of acute CBD administration (Aim 1); (ii) determining the dose of CBD required to reduce pain sensitivity
and cue-induced opioid craving (Aim 2); (iii) understanding the safety of long-term CBD co-administration with
opioid agonist maintenance (Aim 3), and (iv) providing preliminary data on the efficacy of CBD to reduce pain
severity/interference and opioid craving in the clinical setting (Aim 4). Aims 1 and 2 will be carried out through
human laboratory study, and Aims 3 and 4 will be executed through a pilot clinical trial. These studies will
serve as the basis for novel treatments and therapeutic biomarkers for comorbid OUD and chronic pain.
 This proposal will integrate state-of-the-art facilities at Yale and at the VA Connecticut, with established
collaborations with local opioid treatment programs. The applicant has assembled a renowned team of expert
mentors in the fields of opioid, cannabinoid and pain research. This proposal builds on preliminary work on
cannabinoid modulation of pain sensitivity in humans with comorbid OUD and chronic pain. Formal didactics,
symposia and national scientific meetings will support the applicant’s training. Specific training goals include
developing exceptional skills in (i) behavioral pharmacology of addiction (ii) multimodal assessment of pain, (iii)
clinical trials and advanced biostatistics, (iv) grant writing, and (v) responsible conduct of research. Finally, this
application leverages the applicant’s robust clinical foundation as a board-certified addiction psychiatrist. The
vital support from this K23 award will allow the applicant’s scientific development, leading to an independent
research program that timely combines interdisciplinary methods towards developing novel therapeutics for
OUD and chronic pain."
10809642,"Melanoma incidences are increasing rapidly with 100,350 cases predicted in 2020 in the US. Further,
melanoma is a significant problem in Veterans, and it is among the five most frequently diagnosed cancers
among VA cancer patients. Malignant melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of cancer, and the existing
therapeutics, including recently approved BRAF inhibitors, have not been fully effective in melanoma
management due to acquired resistance. Therefore, novel target-based approaches are needed for the
management of this neoplasm. We have an ongoing research program to define the role of sirtuins in
melanoma. The mammalian sirtuins constitute a family of seven members (SIRT1 – SIRT7), which play critical
roles in important cellular processes, and are involved in a variety of diseases, including cancer. The role of
SIRTs in cancer is complex, and they appear to have dichotomous functions depending on cell context. Recent
studies have implicated sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), a predominantly nuclear protein, in regulating pathways involved in
gene transcription, glucose homeostasis, DNA repair and telomere integrity. SIRT6 has been found to
suppress tumorigenesis in the intestine and liver. However, SIRT6 also has a pro-proliferative role in skin and
prostate cancer, suggesting that its function may be tissue- and context- dependent. Interestingly, SIRT6 has
also been shown to modulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promote metastasis in certain
cancer types. In a recent study, we have demonstrated that SIRT6 is overexpressed in human melanoma cells
and tissues, and SIRT6 inhibition via shRNA-mediated RNA interference resulted in a marked antiproliferative
response (growth inhibition, cell cycle alternation, inhibition of cell migration, senescence and autophagy
dysregulation) in melanoma cells. Our preliminary data and published study together with other published
research provide a strong scientific premise to our investigation into the role and potential therapeutic
significance of SIRT6 in melanoma and supports our proposed hypothesis that SIRT6 plays a critical role in
melanocytic transformation and melanoma progression and together with other driver pathways, can be
therapeutically exploited for melanoma management. The following specific aims are proposed: 1) To define
the role of SIRT6 in melanoma development and progression and its association with critical melanoma driver
pathways employing a tissue microarray (TMA) created from retrospective melanoma tissues from Veteran
patients. In this aim, we will determine the role of SIRT6 in melanoma as well as its association with critical
melanoma driver pathways (RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK-, and p16/cyclin D-CDK4/6-RB- pathways); 2) To determine
the functional and mechanistic significance of SIRT6 in melanoma. In this aim, we will determine the effect of
CRISPR/Cas9 mediated SIRT6 deletion on growth and progression of melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo; and
3) To determine the therapeutic significance of SIRT6 inhibition alone and in combination with other promising
target-based anti-melanoma modalities in vivo. We will determine the effects of SIRT6 inhibition using small
molecule SIRT6 inhibitor alone and in combination with other clinically relevant melanoma therapies (BRAF
inhibitor, Vemurafenib; and MEK inhibitor, Trametinib) on melanoma development, growth and metastasis in 1)
Braf-Pten mouse model, and 2) patient-derived xenografts (PDX). We expect that our study will define the role,
mechanism, and interactions of SIRT6 in melanoma as well as novel combinations in pre-clinical settings,
which could be useful for future clinical investigations. This may ultimately lead to the development of novel
diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches for melanoma. Hence, our proposed study is relevant and
significant to the health care of Veterans and is in line with the mission of the Department of Veteran Affairs."
10738769,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a global epidemic and its prevalence among US veterans is higher than the civilian
population. Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of death in diabetics. The coexistence of HF and DM poses
clinical challenges and results in much poorer prognosis. Cardiac metabolism is central in the pathophysiology
of both DM and HF but our understanding of the metabolic adaptations when they coexist is very limited. Co-
existence of HF and DM in humans is a complex chronic condition that is difficult to recapitulate in an animal
model. Hence, HF patients with DM undergoing therapy with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) present a
unique opportunity, as human cardiac tissue and serum become available, both before and after intervention.
These samples become extremely more informative when we prospectively associate cardiac recovery with
molecular and metabolic changes while on LVAD support. The infusion of non-radioactive 13C tracers in DM
HF patients can further interrogate the dynamic metabolism.
 Our recent studies demonstrated that impairment of glucose oxidation in mice and humans is directly
linked to development of HF. We also found that diabetic HF patients have significantly lower cardiac recovery
rate following LVAD unloading compared to non-diabetics. Interestingly, well-controlled DM patients showed
improvement of cardiac structure and function following LVAD support compared to poorly controlled. We
hypothesize that well-controlled glycemia may enhance myocardial recovery through improved
glucose uptake and oxidation (Aim 1a). We will compare changes of glucose uptake rate between pre- and
post-LVAD implantation for each group. In addition, we will compare the relative flux from pyruvate to lactate,
and from pyruvate to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle between well-controlled and poorly controlled DM patients
using 13C glucose. We will examine whether relative changes in flux of these pathways correlate with relative
changes in cardiac function and structure between the two groups. Since our study of pentose phosphate
(PPP) and one carbon metabolism (OCM) pathways indicated that upregulation of PPP and OCM correlate
with restoration of redox homeostasis (NADP+/NADPH) and recovery, we hypothesize that redox
homeostasis may be restored in diabetic HF patients with well-controlled glycemia through increased
flux of PPP and OCM pathways (Aim 1b). Therefore, the group of well-controlled glycemia is likely to show
significant improvement in relative LVEF and LVEDD change compared to the poorly controlled.
 Studies of HF in humans provided evidence that ß-hydroxybutyrate (ßOHB) utilization may be
upregulated in hypertrophic and failing hearts. However, it is unknown whether this change is adaptive or
maladaptive for myocardial recovery in HF with DM. Our studies showed that monocarboxylate transporter
(MCT) 1 and 4 (involved in ßOHB transport) and ßOHB levels, are significantly higher in cardiac tissues of
diabetic HF patients, compared to non-failing hearts. We hypothesize that increase flux of ßOHB oxidation
in cardiac tissues of diabetic HF patients may correlate with the relative improvement in cardiac
function and structure following LVAD unloading (Aim 2a). Furthermore, the advent of sodium-glucose
cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), a new class of glucose-lowering drugs, has been shown to significantly
reduce cardiovascular events, HF hospitalizations, and cardiovascular death in multiple clinical trials.
Enhanced glucosuria as a result of SGLT2 inhibition has been shown to promote fatty acid oxidation and
ketogenesis in the liver and increase plasma level of ßOHB. We hypothesize that high plasma ßOHB as a

10909824,"Systemic immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive cell transfer (ACT) therapies have been used successfully
in high mutational burden tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma, resulting in
objective response and longer survival. For ACT, surgery is often required to obtain solid tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes (TIL), which must then be isolated and expanded due to their small quantities. Alternatively,
malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) that occur in advanced NSCLC have abundant tumor and immune cells.
These are palliated with drainage, and the fluid is discarded as medical waste. However, our preliminary
observations indicate that MPEs may contain a subset of immune cells which can be activated toward anti-
tumor activity. These abundant immune cells could be a source for adoptive cell transfer therapy with the
advantages of (1) being readily available without surgery and (2) possibly requiring less expansion. I
hypothesize that there is a subset of T cells in NSCLC MPEs which can be used for ACT therapy. The
objective of this proposal is to optimize and expand tumor specific T cells from NSCLC MPEs for ACT therapy.
This proposal will undertake studies that establish critical pre-clinical data en-route to a clinical trial with
adoptive T cell transfer in Veterans with lung cancer. Thirty pleural effusions and 10 solid lung cancer tumors
will be collected as medical waste from patients undergoing clinically indicated drainage or surgery. The first
Aim will compare anti-tumor reactivity of MPE resident T cells (MPET) to traditional TIL and determine T cell
receptor repertoire and tumor mutational burden for neoepitope prediction.
The second Aim will characterize the bioenergetic state of MPET that are trapped in the metabolically hostile
environment of a pleural effusion. We will define the mechanisms of T cell metabolic dysfunction in a pleural
effusion, and also study alterations on anti-tumor activity after metabolically reprograming T cells with a
commercially available modulator of the glycolysis pathway.
The third and final Aim will determine if MPET can be successfully expanded to sufficient quantities for ACT
therapy without reaching terminal exhaustion. We will also optimize the metabolic state of MPET to enhance
activity after expansion.
Together, the proposed studies will provide insight about an unexplored tumor environment with potential to
provide large quantities of readily accessible tumor specific immune cells. This project may lead to the use of
immune cells from MPE as a source for adoptive cell transfer therapy in Veterans with NSCLC."
10731379,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a major problem in America, currently reaching epidemic levels.
Unfortunately, OUD is especially prevalent among Veterans, as it is common that Veterans need pain
treatment and the liberal use of opioids in medicine is one of the major reasons why the OUD problem
keeps growing.
There are good treatment options for OUD: Both buprenorphine and methadone can be used in
maintenance therapies in which, as long as the patient stays in treatment, they will not likely truly abuse
opioids. This is extremely important as one major reason for death in OUD is death by fentanyl
overdose, and a patient in maintenance therapies will likely avoid that fate. However, it is very common
that patients discontinue treatment.
An important gap in knowledge arises from the fact that we have no means to predict which patients
are more likely to drop from treatment. Such prediction would be of great interest as limited resources
could be optimally allocated. In addition, an understanding of the brain circuitry behind both OUD and
OUD treatment outcomes is necessary for the rational design of the next wave of therapeutic
approaches.
Big data approaches to scientific questions are increasingly common, however in psychiatry advances
are (as usual, psychiatry likely being the most complex field in medicine) lagging. We have shown that
using a machine learning approach to human brain imaging analysis, we can classify psychiatric
patients according to past suicide attempt and high suicide ideation. We propose to use a similar (albeit
improved) approach to the prediction of buprenorphine treatment in Veterans with OUD.
We propose to use different MRI modalities (structure, white matter, resting state functional
connectivity) and limited genotyping (two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the µ opioid receptor and
the α 5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit known to be associated with OUD risk) in machine
learning algorithms to predict OUD treatment outcomes. MRI and genetics will be collected before
treatment and MRI again within 10 days of treatment initiation (with a smaller group imaged at 6 months
also), and Veterans will be followed up to study outcomes.
If successful, this proposal would provide both mechanistic data (brain circuitry and function, including
a genetic component) about OUD and OUD treatment outcome, and an unbiased approach to OUD
treatment prediction."
10757669,"Abstract
 The MARBLES (Markers of Autism Risk in Babies: Learning Early Signs) Study was launched in 2006 as the
first epidemiologic cohort of younger siblings of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) to begin follow-
up before and during the prenatal period when ASD is likely to originate. In contrast to population-based cohorts
that require large sample sizes given a relatively low prevalence of ASD (1 in 44) and typically are not able to
conduct gold standard diagnosis of ASD, the enriched-risk design offers greater efficiency by enrolling
participants at high familial risk for developing ASD (>20%) and other neurodevelopmental concerns (15-20%).
Other cohorts of high-risk younger siblings recruited postnatally, with the exception of the EARLI study that is no
longer enrolling. Early enrollment provides an opportunity to examine a broad array of environmental exposures
and early biomarkers. Given increasing prevalence of ASD, it is critical to invest in studies identifying factors
responsible for increasing risk and the mechanisms underlying ASD etiology, which are not yet well-understood.
This project addresses both gaps by maintaining and enhancing the infrastructure of the MARBLES enriched-
risk cohort. The MARBLES study has enrolled over 522 pregnancies for 533 children and collected nearly 28,000
samples, comprehensive data on exposures, medical history, diet, lifestyle, and home factors, measured
methylation, expression, immune, nutrient, and contaminant markers, and conducted rich characterization of
neurodevelopmental outcomes using gold-standard clinical assessments. The MARBLES study employed a
multi-pronged recruitment approach that includes a variety of community outreach activities that resulted in a
sociodemographically diverse cohort allowing examination of differences in distributions and associations of a
multitude of environmental factors across race, ethnicity, nativity, parental education, and other socioeconomic
indicators. The MARBLES team has a history of supporting both scientific and workforce diversity and will
continue to expand these efforts. We propose to continue to enroll and follow participants under a streamlined
protocol that will now accommodate Spanish-speaking families, and expand our online presence to more widely
share resources for one of the only enriched-risk ASD cohorts in the U.S. with prospectively collected pregnancy
data and biosamples and deep evaluation of risk factors, mediators, and outcomes, to advance discovery of
etiologic factors and early biomarkers for ASD. We will further work to understand the racial, ethnic, and
sociodemographic disparities that exist in the diagnosis of ASD that are likely driven by structural racism14 by
collecting information from our participants on experienced discrimination and by linking to neighborhood-level
factors. Completion of these aims will markedly enrich MARBLES resources, expedite collaborative sharing, and
allow us and future collaborators to better address questions on predictors of ASD in an enriched-risk cohort,
while more thoroughly adjusting for confounding factors including those resulting from structural racism, and will
add understanding of how experienced discrimination plays a role in these families’ care and well-being."
10745323,"Patients recovering from acute COVID-19 infection often suffer from a multitude of debilitating chronic physical
symptoms that can last up to 6 months or more. The incidence of fatigue, cognitive impairment and respiratory
symptoms are reported to be very high in the post-COVID period. The underlying pathophysiology of cognitive
impairment is unclear in these patients. Notably, sleep disturbances are common during this post-COVID
period, and sleep apnea has been associated with an increased risk for severe COVID infection. Thus, it is
conceivable that sleep fragmentation, per se, may confer an increased risk for chronic cognitive deficits in
Veterans post-COVID. Our proposed pilot project will determine if there is a link between post-COVID sleep
disturbances, sleep apnea and cognitive function. Knowledge gained from our examinations may guide
development of novel management pathways, i.e., mitigation of sleep disturbances may present a therapeutic
strategy for alleviating chronic post-COVID cognitive impairment.
Aim1 will investigate the effect of sleep duration and sleep quality on neurocognitive function in post-COVID
Veterans. Aim 2 will study whether the severity of OSA determines neurocognitive function Veterans who are
post-COVID. This is an observational study where we will gather retrospective as well as prospective data on
the long-term effects of COVID on neurocognitive function and sleep. Our long-term goal is to enhance
rehabilitation and recovery of function of Veterans suffering from post-COVID consequences that may arise
due to sleep disturbances, with the ultimate objective of improving the overall health and quality of life of
Veterans recovering from COVID-19 infection."
10840827,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Family planning (FP), including provision of contraception, is care that supports individuals to achieve their
desired number, timing, and spacing of children. Expanding access to postpartum FP can prevent maternal and
infant morbidity and mortality by decreasing unintended pregnancy and short inter-pregnancy intervals. India is
the country with the largest number of women with an unmet need for contraception, and rural postpartum women
are among those with the highest unmet need. Community-based infant vaccination programs in rural India are
an ideal setting to provide postpartum FP care because they are well-attended, and the infant vaccine schedule
provides multiple opportunities to offer FP care including outreach and follow-up to postpartum women and
couples. Our prior work in the region shows that gender-transformative programs – i.e., those that address
restrictive gender norms (social expectations of people’s behavior based on their perceived gender) – are
associated with increased contraceptive use and agency in contraceptive decision-making. Our central
hypothesis is that linking community-based, gender-transformative FP care with existing public infant vaccination
programs will reach more rural postpartum women and couples and improve uptake of postpartum contraception.
The objective of this study is to pilot test PIVoT (Postpartum Integration of Vaccines and contraception
through gender-Transformative programming), delivered by a nurse as a 30-minute counseling session plus
contraception provision if desired (including intrauterine devices) at three infant vaccine visits that occur over an
8-week period in rural India. Our qualitative research from the region demonstrate that this model of care is
feasible and acceptable to both our target population and providers.
Using a hybrid-effectiveness design, the Proctor Implementation Outcomes Framework, and a mixed-methods
approach, including a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial, this study aims to assess the effect of the
PIVoT intervention on:
1. Implementation outcomes -- intervention feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, uptake, and fidelity and
2. Preliminary effectiveness -- contraceptive use, quality of care, and contraceptive decision-making agency.
Villages (N=12) in rural India will be randomized to deliver the PIVoT intervention or the standard of care (referral
to public health centers for FP counseling and provision of contraception) to postpartum women at infant
vaccination visits. Implementation outcomes will be assessed via surveys from PIVoT participants (N=294), in-
depth interviews with a subset of women participants, their husbands, and PIVoT providers (N=40), and PIVoT
session observations. Our preliminary effectiveness evaluation will involve baseline and 6-month follow-up
surveys with trial participants assessing contraceptive use and agency in contraceptive decision-making and
their perceptions of quality of care. This study has the potential to guide implementation of an innovative gender-
transformative FP intervention which increases access to contraception for postpartum women with unmet need."
10816506,"The AgRP / POMC à Paraventricular (PVH) à Parabrachial (PBN) à Limbic/Reward Satiety Circuit
Because obesity is prevalent and is associated with morbidity and mortality, it is important to understand how
energy balance regulates hunger / satiety, and ultimately causes or curtails eating. While much has been
learned over the past 25 years including the roles of leptin action in the mediobasal hypothalamus, AgRP and
POMC neurons in the ARC, and downstream satiety neurons in the PVH, we still do not know how this energy
balance-regulated circuit controls eating. This is because we do not know what lies beyond the ARCàPVH
circuit. While regulation of emotional valence and reward must be involved, because ARC and PVH neurons
don’t directly engage brain sites controlling these processes, we are still very much in the dark. The goal of
our studies is to address this huge gap in our knowledge. Given that parabrachial (PBN) neurons are
downstream of the ARCàPVH circuit, and given that PBN neurons project to limbic / reward sites, we propose
that PBN satiety neurons are the “missing link”. Barriers exist, however, that have prevented us from bridging
this gap between the ARCàPVH circuit and the limbic / reward “higher brain sites”. They are:
1: We do not know the precise identity of the PVH satiety neurons. This hampers efforts to selectively image,
manipulate and map these neurons, and creates confusion between studies utilizing different PVH “markers”.
2: The PBN is a complex hub that routes many different interoceptive signals to higher brain sites – including
that related to energy balance. This complexity, and the inability to penetrate it, is a huge barrier. Such efforts
would be greatly aided by: a) knowing the inventory of transcriptionally unique neurons that exist in the PBN,
b) the PBN sub-nuclei “addresses” of each of these neurons, and c) having tools to “access” these neurons.
3: Related to “barrier 2”, we do not know the identity of the “missing link” PBN satiety neurons.
To address these barriers, this grant proposes the following three aims:
Aim 1: To build a transcriptomic neuronal atlas of the PVH, and to identify and study the specific neurons that
correspond to the two genetically distinct PVH satiety neurons (one marked by Mc4r, the other by Pdyn).
Aim 2: To build a transcriptomic neuronal atlas of the PBN, and use In Situ Sequencing to spatially assign
each PBN neuron to its PBN sub-nuclei “address”. This atlas will be a valuable resource for all efforts aimed at
understanding the “routing” of interoceptive information by the PBN – including that related to energy balance.
Aim 3: To identify PBN satiety neurons and elucidate the neural mechanisms by which they regulate hunger /
satiety and emotional valence. Given that these PBN neurons project to “higher sites” controlling emotional
valence and reward, the discovery of these PBN satiety neurons provides the means for mechanistically
understanding how caloric deficiency ultimately compels eating (and vice versa)."
10814396,"Mucormycosis, caused by Mucorales fungi, is a life-threatening infection that occurs in patients immunocom-
promised by diabetic ketoacidosis, neutropenia, corticosteroid use, and/or increased serum iron. Because of
the rising prevalence of mucormycosis risk factors, the incidence of the infection has risen. The increased
number of mucormycosis cases is highlighted by the recent epidemic seen among COVID-19 patients
(>47,000 cases have been reported in India alone since May of 2021). Despite disfiguring surgery and aggres-
sive antifungal therapy, the overall mortality of mucormycosis remains at 50%, and approaches 100% in pa-
tients with disseminated disease, persistent neutropenia, or brain infection. Clearly new strategies to prevent
and treat mucormycosis are needed.
The spore coating proteins (CotH) are cell surface antigens that are universally present among, and highly ex-
pressed on, spores and hyphae of Mucorales fungi. CotH proteins are critical determinants of pathogenesis by
enabling fungi to invade host tissues during initiation of infection and further hematogenous dissemination. The
importance of CotH proteins to infection is highlighted by the high protective/curative capabilities of anti-CotH
monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against murine mucormycosis.
Through a Phase I SBIR funding, Vitalex Biosciences was able to humanize a protective murine MAb (VX01)
that shows 10-fold higher binding ability to CotH3 antigen and is as protective as its parent mouse MAb against
murine mucormycosis. Importantly, combination therapy of the humanized MAb and current standard of care of
antifungal agents show high degree of synergy in protecting immunosuppressed mice from mucormycosis. In a
GLP-compliant tissue cross reactivity studies, we show that VX01 has favorable cross reactivity to human tis-
sues. Finally, we are now in possession of three Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) Research Cell Banks that are
capable of producing 2-3 g/L of VX01. Thus, it is our intention to continue with the manufacturing of the human-
ized MAb to enable IND-filing and initiation of clinical trials. Our specific aims are to : 1) perform Research Cell
Bank (RCB) clonal candidate selection and develop/optimize upstream and downstream processes of VX01
production and purification; 2) perform analytical method development, formulation development and produce
GLP material for toxicity studies; and 3) perform IND-application enabling studies including tissue cross reac-
tivity and GLP-toxicity (main, recovery and toxicokinetics) studies in rats.
The preclinical synergy between the VX01 and antifungals strongly indicate that developing VX01 as adjunc-
tive therapy will strongly improve the abysmal outcome of mucormycosis. If successful, this study will shift the
treatment paradigm by introducing the first adjunctive immunotherapy against fungal infections by targeting
unique and pivotal aspects of mucormycosis pathogenesis. Achieving the manufacturing Aims of this proposal
will position Vitalex to collaborate with big Pharma to conduct cGMP production, and clinical testing."
10828738,"RNA decay is a critical component of RNA homeostasis. Transcriptionally active cells such as neurons
have developed intricate pathways for regulating RNA turnover and balancing this process with RNA synthesis.
During the initial funding period, we uncovered widespread abnormalities in RNA stability in cells from individuals
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), implicating dysfunctional
RNA clearance pathways in disease pathogenesis. We also showed that many of these abnormalities could be
recapitulated by the deposition of TDP43, a nuclear RNA binding protein and splicing factor that is mislocalized
to the cytoplasm in >95% of ALS patients and the most common subtype of FTLD (FTLD-TDP). In probing the
downstream consequences of TDP43 deposition, we discovered that TDP43 accumulation preferentially affects
the splicing of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins, leading to excessive intron retention and mRNA
destabilization. Based on these results, we hypothesize that TDP43 mislocalization and accumulation in ALS
and FTLD-TDP destabilizes ribosomal protein-encoding mRNAs, compromising translation and interfering with
RNA decay mechanisms that rely on active translation, including nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD).
Together, these phenomena would be expected to trigger a vicious cycle culminating in RNA and protein
dyshomeostasis, and eventually neurodegeneration. The current proposal builds on data from the initial funding
period to (i) elucidate the mechanism of RNA destabilization by TDP43, (ii) categorize the impact of RNA
destabilization on protein translation and RNA homeostasis; and (iii) evaluate the therapeutic potential of two
promising genetic modifiers, UPF1 and YTHDF2, for their ability to restore RNA homeostasis and extend
neuronal survival in human neuron models of ALS and FTLD-TDP. These goals are mirrored by our long-term
objectives: to crystalize the function of TDP43 in neurons and other cell types, and harness this information to
devise effective neuroprotective strategies for ALS, FTLD-TDP and related TDP43-proteinopathies."
10839342,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
 The population of adults over 65 is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse. Despite
improvements in the quality of end-of-life care over the past two decades, significant disparities remain. Black
patients and their families report poorer quality end-of-life care, are more likely to receive ineffective and
burdensome care and are less likely to enroll in hospice at end of life. Effective patient-doctor communication
is crucial for improving the quality of end-of-life care. Physicians, who are mainly White and Asian in the United
States, are less likely to discuss end-of-life care and display poorer communication styles with Black patients.
Implicit bias refers to unconscious, automatic attitudes or stereotypes. Physician implicit racial bias is
widespread and associated with communication behavior in some clinical situations. The effects of this bias on
communication in the end-of-life setting have not been studied.
 The proposed combination of didactics and mentored clinical investigation will allow Dr. Chuang to build
on her existing quantitative and qualitative skills by designing simulated patient encounter measures of
communication behavior, developing expertise in community engaged research, and developing a clinical trial.
Mentored investigation will occur under the instruction of three senior investigators with expertise in serious
illness communication, health disparities and community engaged research, and palliative care. The specific
aims include: 1) to test the impact of implicit bias and stereotyping on clinician communication behaviors, 2) to
identify elements of end-of-life communication that are most important to Black patients facing serious illness in
an urban community, and 3) to assess the feasibility, acceptability and potential efficacy of an end-of-life
communication training intervention for clinicians to mitigate the effects of implicit bias and stereotyping.
 Dr. Chuang will assess the relationship between implicit bias, stereotyping and communication in a
simulated setting using validated measures of implicit bias and communication behaviors. She will obtain
feedback from physicians on their communication and implicit bias training needs and preferences. She will
design, implement and analyze in-depth caregiver focus group interviews to inform the main intervention.
Finally, she will design and implement an implicit bias and stereotyping mitigation and communication skills
training intervention for physicians incorporating evidence-based bias mitigation techniques and caregiver
input, which will be piloted in a small randomized controlled trial. This will directly lay the foundation for an R-01
application for a multi-site randomized controlled trial to test how the intervention leads to changes in patient-
and family-centered outcomes as well as clinical and healthcare utilization outcomes. This training in advanced
qualitative and quantitative methods will produce a confident patient-oriented health disparities researcher."
10831963,"Abstract
The incidence of childhood type 1 diabetes (T1D) continues to increase; however, the specific cause remains
elusive. Our preliminary results indicate that the incidence of islet autoimmunity (IA) doubled in Colorado children
born in 2004-2010, compared to those born in 1993-1998. Our overarching goal is to identify environmental
triggers and/or protective factors responsible for the increased risk. Specifically, we will evaluate whether
increasing early childhood overweight, decreased exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, delayed
introduction of gluten in the infant diet or decreased number of polio vaccine doses in the initial 6 months of life
could play a role. We will collaborate with outstanding virology laboratories to further elucidate the role of
enteroviral infections in triggering IA. In a nested case-control study we will test serum samples collected at 9,
15, 24 months of life, and annually thereafter, using the VirScan assay, which detects antibodies to thousands
of epitopes of human viruses and will test white blood cells from the same subjects and time-points for the
presence of enteroviruses. We will test the hypotheses that enteroviral infections with higher viral antibody
response breadths and persistent presence of enterovirus in white blood cells are associated with IA and T1D.
Finally, we will ascertain the incidence of IA in genetically at-risk youth until age 20 y as well as explore the
evolution of dysglycemia and the rate of progression to T1D in youth persistently positive for islet autoantibodies,
up to 30 y of age. In the latter, we will monitor the evolution of dysglycemia and progression to T1D using
continuous glucose monitoring. The proposed studies will help to find the environmental causes of T1D as well
as inform screening for pre-symptomatic T1D and prevention trials in children and adolescents."

10828825,"Spermatogenesis is a highly unique differentiation process that involves complex mechanisms of gene
regulation, particularly at the level of the transcriptional machinery. The complexity of this process is
underscored by the fact that 30% of male infertility is attributable to sperm morphology defects and/or poor
semen quality. Bromodomain-containing (BD) proteins are critical regulators of transcription, which act by
binding acetylated histone residues at their target loci and recruiting the appropriate transcriptional regulators.
Mutations in the genes encoding three BD proteins (BRDT, BRD4 and BRWD1), or that of their interacting
proteins, result in morphologically abnormal sperm in mice, and have been associated with poor semen quality
and infertility in men. We hypothesize that BRDT, BRD4, and BRWD1 play interconnected roles during
meiotic prophase I and spermiogenesis, two key stages of spermatogenesis during which stringent
transcriptional regulation is exerted, to ensure appropriate transcriptional control and chromatin
compaction leading to the production of morphologically normal sperm. We propose the following model:
(1) during meiotic prophase I, BRDT ensures appropriate temporo-spatial control of transcriptional repression
to allow for the events of recombination and synapsis; (2) then, upon entry into spermiogenesis, BRDT aids in
chromatin compaction during histone-to-protamine exchange, by shutting down transcription across the
genome; (3) at the same time, BRD4 and BRWD1 are required to overcome the transcriptional silencing
imposed by BRDT specifically at genes essential for spermatid development. Studies herein will test this
integrated model of BD action in mice and men. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the role of BRDT in mediating
progressive transcriptional shut down during meiotic prophase I using a mouse mutant lacking Brdt. We will
examine meiotic progression in wildtype and mutant spermatocytes, and will define the genome-wide
distribution of BD proteins and components of the transcriptional machinery. We will ask whether BRDT
function is dependent on synapsis or recombination. In Aim 2, we will explore the role of BRWD1 and BRD4 in
overcoming BRDT-mediated repression and ensuring expression of critical spermatid differentiation genes. We
will investigate how BD proteins co-operate to ensure the correct chromatin environment is in place to allow for
the progressive nuclear compaction that arises due to the histone-to-protamine exchange. In Aim 3, we will
map the genome-wide distribution of BRDT and BRWD1, histone acetylation, and transcription in human testis,
with matched analysis of sperm morphology. By combining these data with analysis of sperm chromatin
compaction in wildtype and BD knockout mice, we will develop machine learning tools that permit stratification
of sperm from infertile men based on BD protein function and chromatin compaction. These studies are the
first to elucidate the coordinated roles of BD proteins in ensuring normal sperm morphology and we will apply
our understanding of this transcriptional regulation to defining the causes for sperm defects in infertile men."
10828830,"Male infertility is well-recognized as a major health problem in the United States. Clinically, the major cause is
poor semen quality, that is, oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, and/or teratozoospermia. About half of
infertility cases are thought to be genetic in nature, although the molecular bases are mostly unknown.
Remarkably, these sperm defects are not limited to infertile men; ~2% of all men exhibit suboptimal sperm
parameters, and the sperm counts among men in many developed countries have more than halved in the
past 40 years. Again, the underlying causes are unknown. Thus, it is a priority to understand the molecular
basis of these disturbing increases in reproductive problems in men. With respect to genetic and epigenetic
contributions to infertility, there are many stages and molecular processes that can be affected, including all
stages of spermatogenesis, and roles for thousands of genes required for fertility. This project focuses on post-
transcriptional gene regulation during spermiogenesis, the elaborate process by which round haploid
spermatids undergo dramatic morphological development to become mature, flagellated spermatozoa with a
highly compacted, inert genome. Post-transcriptional gene regulation plays a substantial role in
spermiogenesis. The 3′UTR (3′ untranslated region) is central in this respect, affecting mRNA stability,
translation and localization by influencing polyadenylation, access to regulatory proteins and noncoding RNAs,
and loading onto ribosomes or ribonuclear protein particles (RNPs). This project seeks to understand if and
how variation/mutation in the 3′UTRs of infertility patients plays a role in haploid gene expression and infertility.
Aim I will determine if there are systematic or specific alterations in the post-transcriptional regulatory function
of 3′UTRs in fertile versus infertile men, using 3′RNA-seq of round spermatids purified from ejaculates, and
public genome sequence data. Based on these data, we will identify and prioritize variants that reside within
motifs predicted bioinformatically to impact mRNA stability or other relevant attributes, focusing on genes
implicated in spermiogenesis. In Aim II, candidate variants will be screened via a high-throughput in vitro
system to identify those that indeed have an impact on mRNA stability and/or translation. Finally, Aim III will
create mouse models of these putative pathogenic variants, and assess molecular and phenotypic effects
upon reproductive parameters such as sperm number, morphology, motility, and fertility. Overall, if successful,
this will be the largest effort to date to identify genetic lesions that cause infertility via disruption of post-
transcriptional gene expression."
10834908,"Abstract
 Autoimmune uveitis, a common cause of blindness, has an unknown etiology and no known cure. We
have been studying experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) induced in mice deficient in various complement
components, inhibitors, or receptors following active immunization with a retinal antigen and the adoptive transfer
of already primed retinal antigen-specific T cells. Our findings strongly suggest that complement, particularly the
complement receptors C3aR and C5aR, are required for not only the priming of autoreactive T cells in the
periphery, but also the migration and/or re-stimulation of already activated pathogenic T cells in the retina. These
findings suggest that these complement receptors could be new therapeutic targets for treating EAU and,
eventually, autoimmune uveitis.
 In this proposed work, we will focus on the previously unknown role of complement in regulating the
migration and/or re-stimulation of already primed autoreactive T cells in a target tissue, using EAU as a model.
We will also elucidate the underlying mechanisms using various systemic and cell-specific complement-related
gene knockout mice and other novel reagents. In addition, we will examine the efficacies and investigate the
underlying mechanisms of our novel complement-targeted reagents for suppressing the migration and re-
stimulation of previously activated uveitogenic T cells in the retina for the treatment of EAU both in mice and in
rats. These studies will significantly improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmune uveitis and
facilitate the development of novel complement-targeted therapeutics for the treatment of this blinding disease."
10834112,"This R35 proposal builds on the principal investigator’s longstanding success seeking the causes of age-
related neurodegenerative diseases and developing treatments for these devastating and largely fatal
disorders. The proposal’s unifying theme is a focus on proteins that participate in ubiquitin-linked quality control
pathways and that are prone, in neurodegenerative diseases, to phase-separate and aggregate. Building on
our recent discoveries in polyglutamine-mediated neurodegeneration and brain-expressed ubiquilins (a class of
proteins implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases), we will apply multi-scalar approaches to define
pathogenic mechanisms, emphasizing intersections with ubiquitin-dependent pathways in the search for novel
therapeutic targets. The importance of ubiquitin in the nervous system extends far beyond its classically
defined degradative role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. But how the broader ubiquitin signaling system is
impaired by, or activated in response to, diseases of the nervous system represents a significant gap in current
knowledge. Leveraging a broad suite of innovative tools/models and an exceptional research environment, we
will address fundamental issues of broad relevance to age-related neurodegeneration. These topical issues
include: the impact of altered ubiquitin signaling in the nucleus; the contribution of altered ubiquitin
homeostasis to selective cell type and regional vulnerability; and the relationship between mutation-induced
changes in phase transitions undertaken by disease proteins, altered function in ubiquitin-linked pathways, and
toxicity in the nervous system. The discoveries we make through the R35 will help define the complex
biological roles of ubiquitin in diseases of the nervous system, highlight potential shared elements of disease
pathogenesis, and identify promising therapeutic targets that could drive the development of treatments for
neurodegenerative disorders."
10811627,"The diaphragm is an essential mammalian skeletal muscle, as it is vital for respiration and serves as a barrier
between the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Defects in diaphragm development are the cause of congenital
diaphragmatic hernias (CDHs), a common birth defect (1:3000 births) that results in severe morbidity and 50%
mortality. Given the diaphragm's functional importance and the frequency and severity of CDH, an
understanding of diaphragm development normally and during herniation is critical. Using mouse genetics, we
definitively established that the pleuroperitoneal folds, transient embryonic structures, and the muscle
connective tissue fibroblasts derived from them critically regulate development of the diaphragm muscle
(Merrell et al. 2015). Furthermore, we showed that mutations in Gata4 in these fibroblasts cause CDH.
Although conditional Gata4 mouse mutants have been critical for dissecting the role of PPFs and Gata4 in
CDH, they are not representative of the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of CDH. We have identified and
created new hypomorphic alleles of Gata4 that faithfully recapitulate both the genotypic and phenotypic
characteristics of human CDH. Based on preliminary data with these new Gata4 alleles, we will test the
hypothesis that Gata4 regulates in a dose-dependent manner development of development of the diaphragm
and CDH. Genetic and environmental disruptions in retinoic acid (RA) signaling have also been proposed to be
an important source of CDH. Using a series of mouse genetic alleles and protocols for modulating maternal
vitamin A, we will explicitly test a role for RA and as well as RA and Gata4 interactions in diaphragm
development and CDH. Our research will provide insights into the multifaceted genetic, molecular, cellular, and
environmental mechanisms underlying the etiology of CDH and its phenotypic and clinical variability."
10795054,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been broadly employed to map large-scale brain dynamics in healthy and diseased populations. Withal its high spatial localization and accessibility to deep brain structures, fMRI suffers from several key limitations, including its vulnerability to systemic physiology and inaccessibility to various neuromodulatory processes, that hinder its use in deciphering the fundamental neurophysiological basis of large-scale brain dynamics. The innovation of this proposal lies in the addition to fMRI of concurrent PET imaging, a modality with higher neuronal specificity and accessibility to a myriad of metabolic and neurochemical processes, to address the essential limitations of fMRI, being an indirect marker of neural activity. Functional PET (fPET) is a recently innovated technique with the potential to track functionally relevant metabolic changes. Specifically, we will first pioneer an analytical framework to link large-scale brain dynamics with concurrent fPET signals; then as a first application, employ this framework to illuminate the neuronal changes linked with naturalistic arousal fluctuations and the metabolic underpinnings of complex network behavior. The outcomes of this proposal will lay the foundation for a long-term independent research program that employs this novel multi-modal technique to probe various neuronal, vascular, energetic and neuromodulatory mechanisms underlying large-scale brain dynamics, and ultimately identifies how disruption of any facets of these mechanisms leads to various pathological syndromes. This candidate has in-depth training in signal processing, statistics, state-of-the-art fMRI and concurrent EEG/fMRI methodology. With additional training in advanced PET methodology, multi-modal integration, neuroscience as well as clinical translational research skills enabled by this grant mechanism, she will be well versed to begin an independent career focusing on 1) developing analytical toolsets to facilitate the application of advanced neuroimaging techniques; and 2) integrating multi- faceted functional information to investigate the biophysical underpinnings of large-scale brain functional dynamics in health and disease."
10831461,"Abstract
Despite recent advances in treatment, metastatic breast cancer (mBCa) remains one of the leading causes of
cancer-related deaths in the United States among women. Chemotherapy remains fundamental to the
management of all molecular subtypes of mBCa and anthracyclines and taxanes are two major types of
chemotherapeutics. One major issue in chemotherapy is drug resistance, both intrinsic and acquired. In addition,
the overall benefit of immunotherapy remains limited for mBCa. There is still a need to develop novel strategies
to overcome chemoresistance and/or the poor response of immunotherapy in mBCa. IRhom proteins (iRhom 1
and iRhom 2) are catalytically inactive relatives of rhomboid intramembrane proteases and play an important
role in regulating the stability and trafficking of other membrane proteins. IRhom1 is overexpressed in several
types of cancers including breast cancer (BCa) and knockdown of iRhom1 led to significant inhibition of tumor
growth in vivo. We have shown that knockdown of iRhom1 led to sensitization of tumor cells to several
chemotherapeutic agents including doxorubicin (DOX) and SAHA. We have further shown that iRhom1 plays a
role in modulating tumor immune response and knockout of iRhom1 resulted in an improvement in tumor immune
microenvironment. To facilitate the therapeutic translation of these novel findings, we have developed a new
nanocarrier that is highly effective in selective codelivery of iRhom1 siRNA and chemotherapeutic agents to
tumors. We have also developed a bioengineered iRhom1 pre-siRNA (pre-siiRhom1) that is biotransformed to
mature siRNA upon intracellular delivery. We have further developed DOX-SAHA, a prodrug conjugate to
facilitate codelivery of the two drugs of synergistic action. This application is focused on further improvement of
the safety and the tumor-targeting efficiency of the nanocarrier as well as the overall therapeutic efficacy of
codelivery of DOX-SAHA/pre-siiRhom1. The underlying mechanism will also be investigated. Three specific aims
will be pursued in this proposal. Aim 1 will develop and characterize an improved nanocarrier for co-formulating
DOX-SAHA and pre-siiRhom1. Aim 2 will investigate the tumor-targeting efficiency of the nanocarrier, and the
PK and tissue biodistribution of DOX-SAHA and pre-siiRhom1 co-formulated in the nanocarrier. Aim 3 will
investigate the in vivo therapeutic efficacy, the underlying mechanism, and the toxicity profile of the combination
therapy in murine and human BCa models. Successful completion of this study will lead to the development of
a new combination therapy for the treatment of different types of cancers including mBCa."
10773040,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genetic variation affecting gene expression level and splicing accounts for a large proportion of phenotypic
variation between humans, including health and disease. The variants that underlie these phenotypic changes
are often discovered by associating individuals’ gene expression data with their genotypes. These methods
can be confounded by population structure in the sample, which leads to false positive and negative errors. As
such, samples are often selected from relatively homogenous populations. However, this limits the applicability
of results to populations not included in the study, and limits the resolution at which potentially causal variants
can be identified. Previous work has shown that controlling for population structure locally across the genome
in association studies of diverse samples serves to reduce error. However, these methods assign individuals to
one of a few ancestral populations and do not fully capture the relatedness between included samples.
 To extend the results of association studies to diverse cohorts, I will develop a method to control for
local relatedness between samples in association studies. The Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG) is a
data structure which encodes the genealogical relationships between samples at each locus along the
genome. In Aim 1, I will develop a linear mixed model approach for association mapping that utilizes a
similarity matrix derived from the ARG to control for local relatedness between samples.
 One barrier in extending the results of association studies investigating gene expression is that the
majority of data currently available is from individuals of European descent. To address this limitation, I
recently generated gene expression data for a large, globally diverse human sample. In Aim 2, I will use the
method developed in Aim 1 to map expression level- and splicing-associated variation in this sample. I will then
investigate enrichment of epigenomic features near associated variants to determine the functional
mechanisms by which they may be driving transcription differences, and I will intersect my findings with
previously discovered disease associations. Using this globally diverse dataset, I will also explore the diversity
and evolution of human gene expression, elucidating the extent to which patterns of gene expression are
partitioned within versus between populations and the sources of such stratification.
 Extending association studies to diverse cohorts requires not only diverse datasets, but also tools that
can appropriately control for patterns of population structure within those datasets; the research proposed here
addresses both goals. This will allow the discovery of associations in previously underrepresented groups and
will also serve to improve confidence in discovering causal variants. Together, this proposed work will
characterize the functional mechanisms linking genetic variation and phenotypic differences in a globally
diverse human cohort."
10794415,"This proposal requests continued Child Health Research Career Development Award (CHRCDA) support for
the Molecular Basis of Pediatric Disease Training Program at the University of Pittsburgh and UPMC
Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP). The primary goal of the Molecular Basis of Pediatric Disease Training
Program is to identify, mentor, and foster the careers of future leaders in pediatric research who are dedicated
to improving child health through discovery. The program offers a two-year experience for one-to-two scholars
per year focused on training in laboratory-based biomedical research relevant to child health. The training
experience is designed to allow scholars to establish careers as independent, NIH-funded pediatric physician-
scientists. The mentoring faculty includes 36 outstanding basic investigators who have a distinguished record
of research contributions and training. The emphasis of the training experience is on the fundamentals of
scientific inquiry combined with the highest standards of excellence for rigor and reproducibility. Each scholar
is expected to conduct an innovative research project in the laboratory of one of the faculty mentors leading to
publications and applications for individual NIH (or equivalent) grants. The program incorporates an innovative
near-peer mentoring initiative, a grant-writing course, and an annual Pediatric Discovery Day. The program
fosters diversity, equity, and inclusion among scholars, training faculty, and program leadership. The
Department of Pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh houses vibrant research programs on the CHP campus
and the 300,000-square-foot CHP Rangos Research Center. We have appointed 35 scholars to the CHRCDA
program at the University of Pittsburgh since its establishment in 1992; 33 have completed training. We also
use departmental resources to support additional junior faculty in the Molecular Basis of Pediatric Disease
Training Program, who are called CHP scholars and afforded training opportunities identical to those of the
CHRCDA scholars. We have appointed 23 CHP scholars to date; 20 have completed training. The outcomes
of our CHRCDA and CHP scholars are excellent. Of the 53 combined CHRCDA and CHP scholar program
graduates, 35 (66.0%) have obtained K02, K08, K23, K99, P20, R01, R03, or U01 (K/P/R/U) funding. Of the 44
combined graduates who completed program support at least 5 years ago, 32 (72.7%) have obtained K/P/R/U
grants, and 25 (56.8%) have secured R/U level funding. Of the 53 program graduates, 26 (49.1%) are currently
in laboratory-based, investigative careers with either active NIH funding or applying for NIH awards. One of the
graduates is a department chair, ten are division or center directors, and 13 are full professors. These
outcomes provide confidence that the Molecular Basis of Pediatric Disease Training Program selects talented
trainees, provides a powerful team of mentors, and offers an intellectually stimulating environment that will
inspire junior faculty in pediatric subspecialties and provide them with the experience and training to become
leaders in child health research."
10767807,"Mechanisms that underlie the life/death decisions in a cell that activated apoptotic caspases
More than half of cancer patients undergo ionizing radiation (IR) treatment. IR-therapy success relies on
causing enough DNA damage in cells to force them to complete the process of programmed-cell death, known
as apoptosis. Unfortunately, some cells can survive exposure to radiation and regenerate tumors, leading to
treatment failure (radioresistance). Since radiotherapy is one of the three most common treatments used
against cancer, understanding how cells survive after exposure to radiation is crucial for radiotherapy
optimization. When a cell gets damaged by IR, a death signal is triggered in the cell leading to the activation of
apoptotic caspases. Apoptotic caspases were once thought to be hallmarks of apoptosis. However, it is now
known that some cells may activate apoptotic caspases but do not die after exposure to radiation. How cells
survive after activating apoptotic caspases remains an active area of research. Thus, the goal of this proposal
is to elucidate how cells survive caspase activity after radiation exposure. I use Drosophila melanogaster,
commonly known as fruit fly, to study how cells survive caspase activity. Cell death, including caspases, and
regeneration in Drosophila share genetic and molecular features with vertebrates, thus, what we learn from this
model organism will likely be translatable to humans. In Aim 1, I will determine the mechanisms/genes that
underlie the life/death decisions in a cell that activated apoptotic caspases. Specifically, I will identify the
signaling pathways that are involved in the regulation of cells that experience apoptotic caspase activity but do
not die. I have decided to target different signaling pathways that are known to be critical for cell survival in flies
and humans, such as Wnt (wingless in flies) and Notch signaling pathways. I anticipate this work will reveal the
genes that contribute to life/death decision of the cell, which will provide a foundation for understanding how
cancer cells survive after exposure to IR. In Aim 2, I will investigate the consequences of having cells that
survive caspase activity but do not die. I am interested in understanding how stable the DNA of these cells is
after surviving exposure to IR and the role of caspases in DNA repair. These studies will bring new insights to
new/novel non-lethal roles of apoptotic caspases that could be exploited to improve radiotherapy. Collectively,
this work will provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of caspases in aiding cells survive after
exposure to radiation and it also will identify mechanisms that may be modulated to improve treatment
outcome in human cancers."
10895481,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This K23 career development project will study the neural underpinnings of impulsivity in adolescent suicidal
behavior (SB). The candidate will obtain critical skills and experience in adolescent suicidology and impulsivity
research, advanced neurophysiologic and longitudinal methods, and translation of neurophysiologic research
to interventional studies needed for a career focused on elucidating brain-behavior mechanisms of adolescent
SB. Suicide is the second leading cause of death in adolescence, and rates of adolescent SB are increasing.
However, its neurobiology remains poorly understood, and treatments specifically targeting SB are lacking. SB
in adolescents is a critical public health problem that demands urgent attention, particularly with research that
will rapidly translate knowledge to clinical applications. Negative urgency, a component of impulsivity, is the
tendency to act rashly in the context of negative emotion. It has been found to be increased among youth with
SB and attempts, and has been linked to impaired inhibition of limbic circuitry by the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (DLPFC), yet precise mechanisms are unclear. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) permits
noninvasive quantification of DLPFC functions such as cortical inhibition (CI), the process by which cortical
interneurons regulate the activity of other circuits. Previous research indicates that adolescents with lifetime SB
have reduced CI in the motor cortex that distinguishes them from non-suicidal youth. However, DLPFC CI has
not been measured in adolescents with SB, nor is it clear how CI relates to cognitive and emotional systems
implicated in SB, such as negative urgency. In order to study CI-related mechanisms of negative urgency in
the DLPFC, simultaneous TMS and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) is required. The candidate proposes
a longitudinal study of inhibitory physiology and negative urgency in 40 depressed adolescents with suicidal
ideation (but no SB) and 40 depressed adolescents with SB. The study will utilize TMS-EEG and self-report
measures of negative urgency to test hypotheses that dysregulated CI is associated with negative urgency,
that DLPFC CI is deficient in adolescents with SB, and that CI deficits correlate longitudinally with changes in
negative urgency and newly emergent SB. The candidate has prior experience with more basic TMS methods;
however, to attain long-term career goals, additional training in EEG analysis, assessment of impulsivity in
suicidal adolescents, and longitudinal/neurodevelopmental research methods is necessary. A robust career
development plan, with multidisciplinary mentorship and collaboration, will involve intramural and extramural
coursework, methodology-specific seminars and training, and a well-defined plan for grant and publication
benchmarks. This will ensure the candidate’s successful transition to an independent clinical research career.
The long-term goal is to utilize data gathered in this project to design a large-scale longitudinal study assessing
neural and behavioral risk factors for developing SB, as well as trials of neuromodulatory treatments that will
reduce the transition from suicidal thoughts to behaviors by targeting alterations in CI and negative urgency."
10806169,"ABSTRACT
HIV continues to be a global health concern that has claimed the lives of millions. Although anti-retroviral therapy
(ART) slows disease progression, ART is not curative due to certain reservoirs of replication-competent virus
that persist during therapy. Therefore, if ART is stopped, then virus can emerge from these reservoirs and rapidly
spread, causing renewed progression towards AIDS. In addition, life-long use of ART is associated with issues
related to cost, medical compliance, and adverse drug events. One strategy for clearing the reservoir of latently
infected cells is to use a kick and kill approach, in which latent cells are “kicked” or activated from latency, and
then concurrently cleared or “killed”. Latency reversal agents (LRA) can “kick” or induce HIV expression from
latent cells, but thus far only a subset of activated latent cells die. Natural killer (NK) cells hold great promise as
killing agents for HIV-infected cells as they re-emerge from latency due to their innate anti-viral recognition and
cytotoxic function. The goal of this research project is to develop new methods to enhance the intrinsic killing
activity of NK cells and to develop NK cell-based kick and kill strategies to reduce the need for life-long ART by
decreasing or eliminating latent viral reservoirs. We intend to approach this proposal by using cutting-edge
technology to engineer the enhanced survival and anti-viral function of NK cells, sophisticated humanized mouse
models of HIV latency, and innovative tools to measure and study the effect of our treatments on the HIV
reservoir. We will test our overall hypothesis that a kick and kill approach will decrease or eliminate the latent
reservoir in the following aims: 1) engineer NK cells to enhance their elimination of HIV-infected cells using an
innovative non-viral mRNA transfection technology, and 2) investigate the effect of novel latency reversal agents
(LRAs) in combination with modified NK cells on HIV reservoirs in a humanized mouse model of HIV latency.
This proposal utilizes Dr. Jerome Zack's (lead PI, UCLA) extensive background in HIV latency and animal
modeling, Dr. Catherine Blish's (dual-PI, Stanford) expertise in NK cell immunobiology and cellular manipulation,
and includes a unique collaboration with Dr. Paul Wender (Stanford), an expert in chemical synthesis, who has
developed a globally unique library of latency reactivating agents (LRAs) with unprecedented latency reversal
capabilities and expanded tolerability that will be tested individually and in synergistic combinations with NK cells.
Together we hope to fully harness the potential of NK cellular therapies, and develop LRA and NK cell
combination therapeutic approaches to provide patients with sustained virologic remissions or complete viral
eradication."
10808163,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We propose a research program in evolutionary genetics and genomics that emphasizes two distinct themes.
The first theme focuses on the island rule – the widespread phenomenon of populations evolving unusual body
sizes after colonizing islands. Advances in our laboratory have established mice from Gough Island, the largest
wild house mice in the world, as a tractable system for understanding genetic mechanisms responsible for the
evolution of extreme body size. Through comprehensive characterization of novel congenic strains, we will
identify genes and mutations involved in this instance of the island rule. To elucidate causes and
consequences of gigantism, we will extend this unique system to genetically dissect another trait associated
with evolution on islands: exploratory behavior. This research direction will reveal genetic principles of complex
trait evolution in novel environments.
The second theme centers on recombination, a process that diversifies offspring genomes and ensures proper
chromosomal segregation during meiosis in many species. Using single-cell methods that enable us to quantify
recombination in individuals, we have discovered that house mice evolved substantial differences in genomic
crossover number over short timescales, with females and males showing discordant trajectories. Motivated by
this advance, we will reconstruct the evolutionary dynamics of the recombination landscape in house mice
across genomic scales (from hotspots to whole genomes) and temporal scales (from thousands to millions of
years). To identify cellular processes involved in the evolution of recombination, we will integrate high-
resolution, sex-specific positioning of crossovers with cellular profiling of key meiotic phenotypes. This
research direction will unveil mechanisms that drive the evolution of a primary determinant of genetic variation.
These distinct themes of research showcase a program that exploits the power of genetics and genomics in
house mice to address fundamental evolutionary questions with breadth and depth. Beyond their evolutionary
significance, the traits of interest are connected to common human diseases. Defects in recombination are the
leading genetic cause of birth defects, body size is related to the metabolic syndrome, and exploratory activity
is associated with neurological disorders. Our research offers potential to illuminate these conditions by
deciphering natural variation in the premier genetic model organism for human disease."

Tremor affects ~1% of the global population or nearly 80 million people. In spite of this staggering figure, both
nomenclature and treatment approaches are inconsistent. Many patients present with tremor affecting the
voice, either in isolation or in combination with tremor of the limbs. Isolated vocal tremor was historically
considered a clinical variant of essential tremor (ET). Recently updated classification criteria, however, exclude
isolated voice tremor from ET classification. This controversy provides an ideal platform for meaningful patient-
oriented research with the potential to substantively address issues related to communication-related disability.
In addition, this K24 midcareer award will allow me to enhance the quantity and quality of mentoring I provide
to students, residents, fellows, and junior faculty. My research focus for this award will be on understanding
differences in the clinical phenotypes between these two patient populations and the impact of voice tremor on
structures of the upper aerodigestive tract and deglutition. In addition, foundational efficacy data regarding
pharmacological therapy for patients with voice tremor will be collected.
Both Career Goals and Research Aims, consistent with the mission of the National Institute on Deafness and
Other Communication Disorders, are proposed for this K24 midcareer award. With regard to career
development and mentorship, the following Career Goals are proposed:
Career Goal 1. To evaluate the quality of my mentoring and implement a plan for improvement through a
formalized training plan
Career Goal 2. To mentor junior students, post-doctoral scholars, residents, fellows, and faculty in translational
science to enhance patient care through scientific discovery
In addition, a multi-disciplinary team has been assembled to address the following Research Aims:
Aim 1. To characterize overlapping and/or distinguishing clinical phenotypes of patients with ETVT and iVT.
Aim 2. To correlate VT severity with altered deglutition in ETVT and iVT.
Aim 3 (Exploratory). To compare systemic and locally administered pharmacological treatment effects for ETVT
and iVT."
10815784,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic ischemia in muscle (skeletal or cardiac) leads to accumulation of lactic acid and other inflammatory
metabolites with subsequent drop in interstitial pH. The ensuing tissue acidosis plays a major role in triggering
claudication (walking-induced pain) and chest pain. The high-affinity and selective mu opioid receptor (MOR)
agonists, endomorphins, are also released under ischemic and inflammatory conditions. Acid-sensing ion
channels (ASIC) are key players in the perception of pH changes associated with tissue acidosis,
inflammation and pain. ASIC are expressed highly in sensory (i.e. dorsal root ganglion, DRG) and central
neurons and are voltage-insensitive, depolarizing cationic channels. Endomorphin-1 (E-1) and -2 (E-2) are
tetrapeptides known to activate MOR and exert analgesic effects. However, our recent findings indicate that E-
1 and E-2 significantly potentiated the acid-induced ASIC3 currents in transfected fibroblast L-cells and in
acutely isolated DRG neurons independent of MOR activation. The potentiation by both opioids was
significantly greater in DRG neurons isolated from rats with ligated femoral arteries (peripheral artery disease
model). Importantly, our in vivo data demonstrated that E-2 significantly enhanced the lactic acid-induced
increase in mean arterial pressure in rats. The E-2-mediated enhancement was significantly attenuated by the
ASIC3 blocker, APETx2, but was insensitive to naloxone. Our long-term goal is to understand the
mechanisms by which endomorphins and clinically employed opiates (oxycodone, fentanyl, remifentanil)
modulate ASIC3 currents, the interacting site on the channel, and how they regulate the exercise pressor
reflex (EPR) which is evoked by muscle contraction. Our overall hypothesis is that chronic muscle
ischemia—accompanied by an acidified and inflamed environment, and enhanced ASIC3 expression—
elevates endomorphin release, leading to enhanced ASIC3 currents. The overall effect is hyperexcitability of
primary afferents that produces an exaggerated EPR. This hypothesis will be tested using complementary in
vitro and in vivo approaches. We will determine the biophysical and pharmacological effects of endomorphins
and prescription opiates on heterologously expressed ASIC3 in L-cells. We will identify ASIC3 channel
residues that functionally negate the actions of E-1 and E-2, but leave the basic physiology of the channel
intact. We also will compare the opioid agonist pharmacological profiles on ASIC channel currents in DRG
neurons from rats with “freely perfused” or “ligated” femoral arteries. We will examine the effects of E-1, E-2
and prescription opiates on the EPR evoked in both wild-type and ASIC3 knockout rats in which the femoral
arteries are “freely perfused” or “ligated”. Overall, these experiments will provide novel information about how
opioid peptides potentiate ASIC currents under ischemic conditions, thereby enhancing pressor responses to
exercise and possibly worsening pain associated with chronic use of prescription opiates (i.e., opioid-induced
hyperalgesia)."
10814884,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Cellular morphogenesis is essential to animal development as well as wound healing and cancer. During
this process, cells coordinately change shape, migrate, and may fuse. Cellular morphogenesis is executed by
molecules called ""effectors"" involved in junctions, cytoskeleton, cell polarity, vesicular trafficking, and other
modules/processes of the cytological machinery. The sex-, tissue-, position-, and time-specificity of
morphogenesis is determined by ""regulators"", such as transcription factors. There are two main knowledge
gaps: (1) how morphogenetic events are temporally scheduled, and (2) how the transcriptional regulatory input
is linked to the effectors. Here, the overall objective is to elucidate an intriguing part of the timing mechanism
that involves a cytoplasmic long-noncoding RNA in post-translational regulation, and to delineate the ""missing
links"" between regulators and effectors for an experimentally accessible structure, the tail tip of C. elegans.
The tail tip is made of 4 cells which, in males only, change shape and migrate at the juvenile-to-adult transition
(J/A), a process called Tail Tip Morphogenesis (TTM). Prior studies showed that (1) a long non-coding RNA
(lep-5) is an instructive switch for TTM onset at the J/A, and (2) transcription factor DMD-3 is required and
sufficient for TTM and coordinates several processes of the cytological machinery. The overall approach is to
(Aim 1) test the hypothesis that the lep-5 lncRNA acts to schedule TTM cell-autonomously by scaffolding the
ubiquitination of a central, conserved node in the heterochronic pathway, LIN-28, by the C. elegans Makorin
protein, LEP-2 (another highly conserved but under-characterized protein), and (Aim 2) to determine what are
the direct targets of DMD-3 and how they function in TTM. Aim 1 will use primarily co-immunoprecipitation
(coIP) and ubiquitination assays to test binding partners of lep-5 lncRNA. Aim 2 will use chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) to identify candidate targets of DMD-3; the roles of these candidates in TTM
will then be tested by labeling them or genetically perturbing them in a strain with subcellular landmarks tagged
with different fluorescent proteins. The expected outcomes include (1) a mechanistic understanding for a novel
paradigmatic role for a lncRNA acting instructively and post-translationally in the regulation of a key conserved
temporal regulator, and (2) the foundation of a systems network model for morphogenesis connecting
transcriptional control by DMD-3 (a conserved transcription factor homologous to human DMRTs) to the
cytological machinery involved in morphogenetic cell behaviors. These results are expected to have additional
positive impacts on biology and medicine by (a) determining how sexual dimorphism occurs by linking sex
determination to morphogenetic effectors; (b) identifying key conserved genes controlling morphogenesis and
its timing, thus potentially identifying new targets for treating defects in pubertal timing, sex-reversal or cancer,
or to aid wound healing; and (c) providing candidate genes that may underlie evolutionary diversity."
10754578,"Project Summary/Abstract
The current proposal is focused on determining protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulation of β-adrenergic
receptors (βARs) function as βAR dysfunction is a hallmark of heart failure. Hormones binding to βAR results
in phosphorylation by βAR kinases (GRKs) promoting desensitization and endocytosis. βAR undergoes
resensitization by PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation in the endosomes. Studies on regulation of βAR function
have majorly focused on kinases due to the belief that PP2A regulation is homeostatic in nature. Unexpectedly,
we identified that PI3Kγ acutely regulates PP2A by phosphorylating an endogenous inhibitor of PP2A(I2PP2A).
Phosphorylated I2PP2A binds to PP2A inhibiting its activity that impairs βAR resensitization. Studies in human
heart failure showed accumulation of β1 and β2ARs in the endosomes with reduction in βAR-associated
phosphatase activity reflecting inhibition of resensitization. Subjecting mice with cardiomyocyte-specific
expression of wild type I2PP2A (WT I2PP2A) to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) resulted in dilation, while
expression of phospho-I2PP2A (pI2PP2A) mimetic that persistently inhibits βAR resensitization did not survive
past four weeks TAC. In contrast, expression of dephospho-I2PP2A (de-pI2PP2A) mimetic that preserves βAR
resensitization showed significant amelioration of cardiac dysfunction post-TAC reflecting a quintessential role
for resensitization in cardiac remodeling. Since mechanistic underpinnings of pI2PP2A interaction with PP2A is
not known, we used a combination of computational and experimental approaches to show that isoproterenol
(ISO) stimulation of βARs leads to PI3Kγ-mediated phosphorylation of I2PPA, priming its homo-dimerization
resulting in robust binding to PP2A. Docking studies further showed that I2PP2A binds to the C-terminal region
of PP2A (PP2A-CT). Expression of PP2A-CT as a dominant negative strategy in cells preserved βAR
resensitization, while cardiomyocyte-specific expression of PP2A-CT in mice resulted in preservation of cardiac
function following 2 weeks of ISO administration supporting the premise that targeting resensitization may be
beneficial. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that relieving PP2A inhibition from pI2PP2A preserves
βAR resensitization and function underlying beneficial cardiac remodeling, counter-intuitive to the current
option of blocking G-protein coupling with β-blockers in heart failure. In this regard, we surprisingly observed
that βARs in the de-pI2PP2A mice switch their G-protein coupling from stimulatory Gαs (cAMP generating) to
the inhibitory Gαi upon TAC. This suggests that sustaining resensitization allows the βARs to flexibly switch
between G-proteins maintaining cardiac function despite cardiac stress and sympathetic overdrive indicating a,
yet to be understood fundamental mechanism of βAR regulation and therefore, propose the following aims- 1)
determine whether targeting I2PP2A dimerization preserves PP2A activity and restores βAR function, 2) test
whether relieving of PP2A inhibition preserves β1 and β2AR resensitization and cardiac function post-stress, 3)
to investigate how preservation of βAR function in conditions of cardiac stress mediates beneficial effects."
10757665,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although humanized mice have been successfully used for in vivo studies of HIV infection, cancer and
immunotherapies, human naïve and adaptive immune responses remain suboptimal, with limited cross-reactivity
between murine and human cytokines considered as a key contributing factor. As a result, the human mucosal
immune system is not fully developed, and several components are missing, including the presence of human
lung epithelial cells in their natural lung environment. To address these research gaps, we propose a combined
genetic and cellular editing approach to develop the next generation of humanized mice for studies of human
mucosal immunity. Our approach is structured in two aims: in Aim 1, we will construct and credential hNSGF-
SGM3-IL6-TSLP-TSLPR mice for human immune cell development. We will generate mice expressing a
complete human TSLP receptor and examine engraftment with human hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs)
by measuring cellular composition of immune cells in the bone marrow, spleen, gut, airways, lungs, and blood.
To examine human immune function, we will use a mucosal formulation of influenza vaccine (Flumist) as an
immune trigger and antigen source as we have done in the past and analyze cytokine responses in the blood
and spleen; human cell migration to mucosal sites, spleen, and bone marrow; and induction of vaccine antigen-
specific T and B cells in the spleen. In Aim 2, we will construct and credential humanized airway epithelium in
hNSGF-SGM3-IL6-TSLP-TSLPR mice. We will examine the development of human airway epithelium upon
transplant of human bronchial epithelial progenitor cells in NSGF-SGM3-IL6-TSLP-TSLPR mice (humanized or
not with HPCs from the same donor) by tissue immunofluorescence staining of human-specific targets including
HLA class I. To establish the functionality of human airway epithelial cells, we will challenge mice with live
influenza virus and measure the induction of species-specific alarmins including IL-33; type I interferon signature
in human epithelial cells as a measure of their functionality in vivo, as well as tissue composition and attraction
of human immune cells to human airway epithelium. Our hypothesis is that a complete TSLP signaling pathway
and human epithelial cells will improve human mucosal immunity in humanized mice by facilitating the crosstalk
between stromal cells and immune cells. This model can then be used for i. mucosal vaccine development, and
ii. studies of other respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2, which requires human-specific receptors to
establish infection. Thus, once credentialed, our model will lay the groundwork for future mechanistic studies of
mucosal immunity in vivo in the context of genetically variable donors as well as enable studies of mucosal
adjuvants, allergens, vaccines, and biologicals."
10820412,"Project Summary
This is a Bioengineering Research Grant (BRG) proposal in response to PAR-19-158 to further develop and
validate a non-invasive panel of the most critical glioma molecular markers (IDH, 1p/19q, MGMT) using standard
clinical MRI T2-weighted images and deep learning, and extend the performance to tissue-level accuracies.
Currently, the only reliable way of obtaining molecular marker status is through direct tissue sampling of the
tumor, requiring either a craniotomy and stereotactic biopsy or a large open surgical resection. Noninvasive
determination of molecular markers with tissue-level accuracy would be transformational in the management of
gliomas, reducing or eliminating the risks and costs associated with a neurosurgical procedure, accelerating the
time to definitive treatment, improving patient experience and ultimately patient outcomes and survival time.
Artificial intelligence such as deep learning has emerged as a powerful method for classification of imaging data
that can exceed human performance. Preliminary work using our novel voxel-wise classification-segmentation
approach with the NIH/NCI TCIA glioma database has outperformed any prior noninvasive methods for
determination of IDH, 1p/19q, and MGMT methylation, achieving accuracies of 97%, 93%, and 95%,
respectively. The approach however, needs to be validated beyond the TCIA and accuracies need to be
extended in order to achieve tissue level performance. This will be accomplished by using our top-performing
voxel-wise classification framework, leveraging marker-specific targeted sample sizes, and gaining a final boost
from deep-learning artifact correction networks.
In Aim 1 we will curate a database of over 2000 gliomas including 500 subjects from our institution, 1200 subjects
from our external collaborators, and over 300 subjects from the TCIA. We will train our voxel-wise deep learning
classifiers to determine molecular status based on clinical T2-weighted MR images with target accuracies of
97%. In Aim 2 we will rigorously evaluate the motion and noise sensitivity of the networks and create an artifact
correction network with the goals of 1) recovering accuracies in the setting of large amounts of motion/noise and
2) further boosting accuracy to tissue-level performance even in the absence of visible artifact. In Aim 3 we will
deploy a complete end-to-end clinical workflow and evaluate real-world live performance of the AI tool on 300
prospectively acquired brain tumor cases and 300 subjects from our external collaborators. The AI tool will be
made available for deployment at other medical centers. The developed framework can also be extended to
additional markers in a straightforward fashion. In summary, this BRG proposal will further develop, refine and
validate a non-invasive MRI-based method for determining the most critical glioma molecular markers rivaling
tissue-level accuracies to significantly reduce and in many cases eliminate the need for stereotactic biopsy."

10831470,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one killer of Americans, and also causes significant economic costs
to the nation. Thus, understanding the mechanisms through which CVD develops is of paramount importance if
we are to successfully identify those at risk for CVD, and intervene to ultimately prevent CVD-related death and
economic impact. Psychological stress reactivity has long been appreciated as a risk factor for negative CVD-
related outcomes, and recent work suggests that inflammatory reactivity to stress is a critical biological
mechanism through which stress increases risk for CVD. However, there are significant gaps in our current
knowledge regarding the neural predictors and molecular pathways through which stress leads to inflammation.
These knowledge gaps are critical to fill if we are to develop a full mechanistic understanding of how stress leads
to CVD risk, and may also shed light on future intervention targets. Thus, the present project will use cutting-
edge computational methods to identify neural signatures of stress-related inflammatory reactivity, and will use
pharmacological tools to block an important stress-signaling pathway (i.e., beta-adrenergic signaling) and
examine its effects on neural and inflammatory reactivity to stress. Study 1 (N=100) will use fMRI to examine
neural responses to a social evaluative stress task, with blood samples taken before and after the stressor
assayed for pro-inflammatory gene expression and circulating inflammatory proteins. We will use innovative
multivariate machine learning analytic techniques to identify the neural patterns that predict changes in
inflammation, as well as network-based analytic tools from mathematics to examine how large-scale brain
networks change configuration in response to stress in ways that are linked to inflammation. In Study 2 (N=120),
we will conduct a mechanistic, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the beta-adrenergic receptor
blocker propranolol to examine how blocking beta-adrenergic signaling impacts neural and inflammatory
responses to the social evaluative stress task. Together, these two studies will allow us to establish the neural
signatures of stress-induced increases in inflammation (Aim 1), determine the effects of beta-adrenergic
signaling on neural responses to stress (Aim 2), and examine the neural mediators of beta-adrenergic related
attenuations in stress-related inflammatory reactivity (Aim 3). In doing so, this project will ultimately help identify
neural signatures of risk for stress-related inflammation, as well as novel targets for future intervention to
ameliorate the impact of stress on the brain and body and reduce the health and economic burden of CVD."
10821470,"Abstract
Recent reports by our group and others have highlighted the beneficial and detrimental nature of innate
immune cell interactions with intestinal epithelia. Indeed, as observed in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), an
excessive inflammatory response not only results in mucosal injury but is also detrimental for wound repair. We
are now beginning to appreciate that intestinal wound repair is regulated, in part, by common receptors
expressed on both leukocytes and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). We recently determined that the
ubiquitously expressed membrane protein CD47 is necessary for regulating mucosal wound healing in the
intestine and our current data indicates a role for CD47 in both neutrophil (PMN) recruitment and IEC
migration. Our preliminary data suggests that CD47-deficient IECs and PMN express less thrombospondin-1
(TSP1), a soluble ligand for CD47, which promotes PMN recruitment to injured mucosa. PMNs, as the first
responders, also secrete Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) that binds to its high affinity receptor BLT1 expressed on PMN
and amplifies their recruitment. Interestingly, we recently found that IECs also express BLT1 and its ligation by
LTB4 promotes mucosal wound repair. In this project, LTB4 and TSP1 are separately evaluated as ligands for
receptors expressed on PMNs and IECs during inflammation and repair in the gut. We will build on our
preliminary data and previous studies to move toward our goal of understanding mechanisms regulating
mucosal wound repair under inflammatory conditions as seen in IBD. These studies will not only shed new light
on the complex interplay between inflammatory cells and epithelial cells in orchestrating intestinal mucosal
injury/repair in health and disease but may provide new ideas for druggable targets to promote wound repair
during mucosal inflammation."
10802355,"VALE+TU SALUD: Corner-Based Randomized Trial to Test a Latino Day Laborer Program Adapted to
Prevent COVID 19
The ongoing COVID 19 pandemic is having a devastating impact on Latino immigrants, whose members
include day laborers. In Texas, addressing COVID-19 is increasingly urgent given the dramatic rise in cases
during July 2020. At the time of this application, the state has exceeded its base ICU beds capacity and 65% of
COVID-19 hospitalizations are Latino patients. And in Harris county, the site of this proposed study, Latinos
represent the ethnic group with the highest COVID 19 positivity rate (30%) and live in the top 10 zip codes with
the highest infection rates. Latino day laborers (LDL) are immigrant men from Mexico and Central America who
work primarily in the construction and service sectors and are routinely exposed to multiple personal and job-
related stressors, where the later occur in a working context that is dangerous, temporary, poorly paid, and
exploitive. During the current pandemic these stressors have become more acute and have compeled LDL to
continue to seek work daily, live in crowded conditions to afford the rent, and work without needed protections
for maintaining social distancing or securing personal protective equipment (PPE). COVID 19 is likely to
severely impact LDL unless action is taken to address their stressors and support their efforts to prevent it.
Based on a readily available and portable injury risk-reduction program Vales+Tu (You Are Worth More) that
has been successfully tested among LDL, the Vale+Tu Salud (Your Health is Worth More) study will adapt its
evidence-based participant recruitment, engagement, and intervention strategies to promote group problem
solving and a plan to implement together COVID 19 mitigation strategies. Guided by a Community Advisory
Board (CAB) and led by LDL promotores, this corner-based program will be tested in a randomized trial to
answer this question: Can an adapted Latino day laborer program increase adherence to mitigation practices
that reduce the risk of COVID 19? To answer this question, we will pursue these aims: AIM1: Determine the
cultural, socioeconomic, interpersonal and work-related factors that influence COVID 19 mitigation practices
including social distancing, hand-washing and PPE use. AIM 2: Adapt, implement, and test Vale+Tu Salud in a
cluster randomized trial to assess the extent to which LDL report increased adherence with COVID 19
mitigation practices 1 month post intervention. AIM 3: Promote Vales+Tu Salud just-in-time results and
increase its capacity to rapidly disseminate findings among groups that serve LDL and other Latino immigrants.
In the short term, we expect our program to address the urgent need to prevent COVID 19 among LDL by
testing its effectiveness in promoting mitigation practices and the COVID 19 vaccine, when it becomes
available. Over the longer term, we expect that the lessons learned in this COVID 19 prevention program will
transfer to other work and life domains where LDL may adopt similar practices to reduce other health risks."

Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is a childhood ischemic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) that affects 1 in
1200 children between the ages of 2 to 14. It is one of the most serious conditions affecting the pediatric hip as
50% of patients will develop debilitating osteoarthritis, some in their teenage years. A disruption of blood flow
produces extensive ischemic cell death, abundance of necrotic cell debris, and damage-associated molecular
patterns (DAMPs) in the femoral head. We discovered that the necrotic microenvironment incites a chronic
inflammatory response, which impairs bone regeneration and produces femoral head deformity. Macrophages
are the central innate immune cells that coordinate the repair process based on local environmental stimuli. In
juvenile ONFH, macrophages exhibit chronic inflammatory response due to DAMPs and necrotic debris which
leads to further tissue damage and fibrosis. Current treatments do not address the negative pathologic role
played by macrophages in the necrotic bone repair. Here, we propose a new concept of reconditioning the
necrotic bone using minimally invasive tissue engineering methods, thereby, converting a necrotic inflammatory
microenvironment to a regenerative microenvironment. Our long-term goal is to establish these treatment
methods to overcome the substantial inflammatory roadblock and to rapidly recondition the necrotic bone in
order to jump start bone regeneration in patients with juvenile ONFH. Our central hypothesis is that the necrotic
bone microenvironment triggers chronic inflammatory macrophage response, and that tissue engineering of the
necrotic environment by local bone wash (i.e. clearance of DAMPs and necrotic debris) and application of
macrophage-directional modulators (such as bone morphogenetic protein-2 and interleukin-4) will increase pro-
healing macrophages and accelerate bone regeneration. We will attain our goal through three highly related but
independent specific aims. We will 1) determine the therapeutic effects of washing out DAMPs and necrotic cell
debris on macrophage response; 2) determine the effects of macrophage response to local controlled-release
bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) therapy using a hydrogel delivery system on bone regeneration; and 3)
determine the role of interleukin 4-induced macrophage modulation on bone regeneration, using the piglet model
of ischemic ONFH and in vitro experiments in each Aim. We will determine the macrophage and bone repair
responses to the immunomodulatory therapies using tissue, cell, and RNA analytic methods. Successful
completion of this project will have immediate clinical impact by providing a proof-of-concept for the minimally
invasive, yet potentially highly effective, tissue engineering strategies to overcome current barriers to successful
treatment of ONFH. The outcome of this work will lay the groundwork for clinical trials and will greatly advance
our ability to treat ONFH using immunomodulatory strategies."
10909797,"Nearly 30 years after the end of the 1991 Persian Gulf War (GW), an estimated 25-32% of GW veterans still
suffer from Gulf War illness (GWI),1 the term used to describe the symptoms that have plagued many GW
veterans since their return from deployment. Although symptoms may vary from veteran to veteran, GWI
typically includes some combination of fatigue, pain, cognitive/mood dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and
autonomic disturbances such as gastrointestinal (GI), urinary, and sexual dysfunction. Epidemiological data
suggest a possible link between chemical exposures and Parkinson’s disease (PD).4 Although GW military
personnel were exposed to multiple, potentially hazardous chemicals in the Persian Gulf theater, to date there
has been no reliable data on the incidence or prevalence of PD among GW veterans.1 However, it is
noteworthy that many of the symptoms of GWI are similar to non-motor symptoms (NMS) in PD,7 which can
predominate years to decades prior to clinical diagnosis.9 For example, some common NMS in PD include
fatigue, pain, autonomic disturbances, such as GI, urinary, and sexual dysfunction, sleep disturbances,
anxiety, depression, and cognitive dysfunction such as difficulties with memory, concentration, and word
finding. We have preliminary evidence of positive associations between GW veterans’ self-reported frequency
of exposures to deployment-related chemicals and GWI symptoms similar to PD’s NMS. We have also found
an inverse relationship between GW veterans’ self-reported frequency of wearing pesticide-treated uniforms
and measures of manual dexterity. Finally, we have preliminary evidence of negative associations between the
veterans’ self-reported frequency of exposures to GW-related chemicals and basal ganglia volume and basal
ganglia N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a marker of neuronal integrity.11 Because NMS and significant neuronal loss
in the substantia nigra are two characteristics that have been repeatedly noted in individuals who eventually
develop clinical PD,9 based on these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that GW veterans with excessive
exposures to deployment-related chemicals have prodromal PD. While there is presently no cure or disease-
modifying treatment that halts or slows the progression PD, the precocious diagnosis of PD in GW veterans
with high exposures to GW-related toxicants would facilitate the targeted delivery of neuroprotective therapies
when they eventually do become available. Furthermore, these GW veterans may be counseled to adopt
lifestyle changes, such as increasing physical activity, which have been associated with lowering the risk of
PD.13 The proposed four-year study will enroll 140 GW veterans with high levels of exposure to deployment-
related chemicals (e.g., GW pesticide applicators). We will obtain clinical and behavioral measures and in vivo
ultra-high field (7 Tesla) and 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of iron, neuromelanin, and
free water in the substantia nigra. We propose three specific aims that will: (1) evaluate GW veterans using the
International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) research criteria for prodromal PD;14 (2)
examine the association between the veterans’ self-reported frequency of exposures to GW deployment-
related chemicals and 7 Tesla measures of iron and neuromelanin and the veterans’ probability of prodromal
PD according to the MDS research criteria; and (3) compare 3 Tesla measures of free water in the substantia
nigra and scores from various NMS scales from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI)15
dataset in GW veterans with age- and gender-matched healthy controls, PD patients, and subjects with
prodromal PD from the PPMI cohort. The proposed experiments are timely and important because it is
expected to provide much needed information on the long-term consequences of GWI in the context of aging
and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly PD."
10814312,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than 40% of children under 5 years in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are
at risk of not reaching their developmental potential. One of the most effective and proven
strategies for supporting early child development in these settings is to empower
caregivers and communities to support their children’s development. However, evidence
on the effectiveness and the barriers and facilitators to implementation of interventions to
promote this nurturing care are need. In this study, we will use an implementation science
framework to evaluate an individualize intervention to promote nurturing care—the
international Guide for Monitoring Child Development (GMCD), in rural India and
Guatemala. We will conduct a hybrid effectiveness/implementation cluster randomized
trial, where children aged 0-2 years will receive individualized visits from frontline health
workers administering the GMCD. The study will have three parts: In Part 1, we will
randomize clusters to receive either the GMCD or usual care for 12 months. After 12
months, control clusters will cross-in and all children will receive an additional 12 months
of intervention. We will assess the impact of the intervention at 12 and 24 months on
developmental outcomes and on the home care environment. In Part 2, we will use the
RE-AIM implementation science framework to assess the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,
Implementation, Maintenance of the intervention. We will also use the CFIR (Consolidated
Framework for Implementation Research) framework to conduct in-depth complementary
qualitative evaluation of implementation barriers and facilitators in high- and low-
performing clusters from Part 1. In Part 3, we will assess cost effectiveness of the
intervention. In conclusion, the study will answer three important questions: (1) Is the
GMCD effective at improving developmental outcomes and the home care environment for
children at risk in rural India and Guatemala? (2) What real-world institutional and
contextual factors influence the impact of the intervention and might affect its potential
ability to sustainably reach children and families? (3) Is the intervention cost-effective? The
project will generate globally relevant evidence on community-based early child
development interventions in LMICs."

 Over their ~1.5-billion-year evolution from a bacterial endosymbiont, mitochondria have retained genes
essential for energy metabolism on their own distinct genome (mtDNA) in almost all eukaryotes. Human mtDNA
encodes 13 core proteins in the respiratory chain and varies up to 10,000-fold in copy number from ~100 in blood
to ~half a million in the unfertilized egg, with each cell maintaining an intrinsic, optimal setpoint via yet unknown
mechanisms. A decline in this setpoint causes rare but severe disorders with no proven therapies and underlies
the common age-related mitochondrial dysfunction with relevance to Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s Disease.
 In my K99 phase, I propose to address two major unmet needs in clinical and basic mitochondrial biology
– to overcome the detrimental consequences of mtDNA loss and to understand homeostatic regulation of mtDNA
copy number. Genetic studies in yeast, trypanosomes, and my published work in human cells, reveal a
conserved link between membrane potential and tolerance to mtDNA loss. In aim 1, I will determine the
mechanism by which boosting membrane potential rescues the growth of mtDNA-depleted cells. My completed
multi-omic profiling of mtDNA depletion and repletion states has identified a small number of candidate effectors
of membrane potential which I will test using a drug that targets stress signaling, a metabolite that can be
supplemented exogenously, and a protein prosthetic for redox manipulation pioneered by my mentor’s lab. In
aim 2, I will take a more unbiased approach and systematically identify nuclear regulators of human mtDNA copy
number for the first time using a FACS-based genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen, which I conceptualized
and developed in my early postdoctoral work. While my K99 focuses on mtDNA sensing and regulation within
the mitochondrial matrix, my R00 (aim 3) examines the pathways and immunogenic consequences of mtDNA
leakage to the cytosol which is highly relevant to autoimmune disorders. Thus, my independent research
program aims at a synergistic culmination of postdoctoral training in mitochondrial systems biology and PhD
expertise in innate immunity.
 Through my K99 goals I will master the theory and experimentation of bioenergetics and get hands-on
training in high-throughput genetics, from screen design to computational analysis. My mentor, Dr. Vamsi
Mootha, is a world leader with >20 years of experience in precisely the field of my proposed training –
mitochondrial systems biology – and has propelled over a dozen trainees into thriving academic research
careers. I have a diverse advising committee with local and national experts relevant to my proposal, including
one junior faculty member in my department and one immunologist for specific guidance at the R00 transition.
Thus, with the NIH Pathway to Independence award, I will train towards my long-term goal of launching my own
laboratory and discovering basic molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial and autoimmune diseases."

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are pervasive in everyday life. Their extensive use in consumer
products, industrial processes and fire-fighting foam has led to significant contamination of drinking water and
food resulting in universal human exposure. While many studies have investigated the disruption of lipid
metabolism and immune system function by PFAS, less attention has been paid to the adverse effects of
PFAS on bone health. In light of the epidemiological associations between PFAS and lower bone density in
children and adults and the lack of studies investigating the causality and/or mechanisms by which PFAS could
interfere with bone metabolism, the objective of this study is to begin to define the effects of perfluorooctanoic
acid (PFOA) on bone quality. Our research focuses on the interaction of PFAS with nuclear receptors, a likely
mechanism through which PFAS could perturb bone cell function. We have developed a novel, human-relevant
model in which to study the adverse health effects of PFAS: mice expressing human peroxisome proliferator
activated receptor α (PPARα) fed a diet based on the What We Eat In America analysis in NHANES. Our
working hypothesis is that PFAS reduce bone quality through their interaction with nuclear receptors in multiple
bone cell types. To generate the preliminary data needed to support the proof-of-principle for an association
between PFAS exposure and bone health and to hone our working hypothesis, we propose the following
specific aim. We will define the effect of long term PFOA exposure on cortical and trabecular structure,
osteoblast and osteoclast number and function, and the bone transcriptome. We propose to take
advantage of bone and serum samples collected from experiments already conducted in humanized PPARα
mice, PPARα null mice and PPARα wildtype mice: Study 1 – young female and male mice, fed an adolescent
American diet, exposed to PFOA in drinking water for 6 weeks and Study 2 – adult female and male mice, fed
an adult American diet exposed to PFOA in drinking water for 14 weeks. Biological effects on liver and serum
lipid homeostasis are evident in these mice, which have serum PFOA concentrations similar to occupationally
exposed people. Bone structural, histological, biochemical and transcriptomic data will be analyzed.
Comparison between genotypes will begin to define the contribution of PPARα in PFAS-induced adverse
effects on bone quality. The results of this research will provide essential new data on how PFAS negatively
impact bone health and provide the needed foundation to begin to address a critical gap in PFAS research,
establishing the potential for causality in associations between PFAS and loss of bone quality in humans."

T cell responses to the beta cell autoantigen insulin are essential for efficient development of type 1 diabetes (T1D). An important emerging concept related to the essential nature of insulin as an autoantigen is that CD4+ T cell responses develop to unconventional insulin peptides, including hybrid peptides in which amino acids from insulin are linked to those from another protein (or another region of insulin). In the case of beta cell- cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which are essential for beta cell killing, little is known about their ability to recognize unconventional insulin peptides. By analogy to hybrid peptides recognized by tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells isolated from cancer patients, hybrid insulin peptides presented on class I MHC molecules could be generated by proteasome-catalyzed peptide splicing. We have discovered that an H2-Db-bound hybrid insulin peptide is a ligand for beta cell-cytotoxic T cells in NOD mice, creating the first link between class I MHC-bound hybrid insulin peptides and T1D. Our project will test the hypothesis that spliced insulin peptides, and those derived from other non-canonical sources, are important targets of beta cell-cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in T1D. In Aim 1, we will use mass spectrometry to identify the immunopeptidome of human pancreatic islets expressing HLA-B*39:06 or A*24:02, both of which are predisposing for T1D, or A*02:01, commonly expressed by T1D patients. Limited information is available regarding the peptides presented by class I MHC molecules on primary human pancreatic islet cells. We are uniquely positioned to address this based on our robust protocols for the characterization of MHC-bound peptides, including from small samples, coupled with workflows that allow identification of spliced peptides and those derived from other non-canonical sources. Although our project will be focusing on such unconventional insulin peptides, all class I MHC-bound peptides will be identified. In Aim 2, we will investigate unconventional insulin peptides as CD8+ T cell epitopes in T1D and explore their importance in disease pathogenesis. Our recent development of NOD mouse models transgenically expressing human insulin along with HLA-B*39:06, A*24:02, or A*02:01 will allow us to examine the unconventional human insulin peptides identified in Aim 1 for recognition by islet-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. We will use these models and several complementary approaches to further assess the pathogenicity of the T cell specificities we identify. Islet- infiltrating CD8+ T cells from T1D patients will also be examined."

The treatment of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common and lethal form of
renal cell carcinoma, has been revolutionized by therapies directed at vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. Despite this progress, the majority of patients
with advanced disease will develop treatment resistance and ultimately succumb to their disease, making
alternative therapeutic strategies a critical need. We have previously demonstrated that ccRCC is highly
immune infiltrated, mostly by T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs), in particular, tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs). We and others have further demonstrated that TAMs are associated with
resistance to both ICB and VEGF-directed therapy, a process thought to be mediated, in part, by T cell
exhaustion. However, TAMs are phenotypically and functionally diverse, and our preliminary evidence
suggests that only some TAM subpopulations are associated with therapeutic resistance. We hypothesize
that specific TAM subpopulations can impact tumor control and response to therapy by presenting antigen
to and influencing T cell phenotype, and therefore that specific inhibition of these TAMs may increase
response to the therapies. To test these ideas, we propose first to finely characterize APC populations in 3
unique sets of human tumors: treatment-naïve, responsive to combination therapy, and resistant to the
therapy. We then assess APC populations as predictors of patient outcome to construct new predictive
models. Next, to uncover how antigen presentation by TAMs locally modulates anti-tumor T cell
responses, we will use a novel genetically faithful, immunocompetent murine model. Specifically, we will
assess immune cell phenotypes and tumor growth in mosaic mice with TAM-specific genetic ablation of
antigen presentation function, as well as assessing TAMs in vitro for ability to present antigen and
influence T cell states. Finally, we will take advantage of indications that various macrophage-directed
drugs in clinical development may selectively inhibit different TAM subsets. After determining which TAM
subpopulations are associated to resistance to current therapies for ccRCC (anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and
the VEGF receptor inhibitor cabozantinib), we will use the mouse model to assess whether resistance can
be overcome by treating with a macrophage-directed drug that inhibits the resistance-associated TAM
subsets. In summary, the proposed research will yield a detailed atlas of APC and T cell states in ccRCC,
a novel model to predict patient outcome, and an understanding of the role of antigen presentation by
TAMs in ccRCC. Further, the proposed research may reveal a means of overcoming resistance to widely
used therapies for ccRCC. Therefore, this work can open the door for precision-based TAM inhibition
strategies to overcome treatment resistance in ccRCC and other immune infiltrated tumors."
10903705,"World Trade Center (WTC) related disorders inflict a major toll on the health and well-being of WTC
responders. These debilitating conditions can be ameliorated or even reversed with lifestyle medicine
programs targeting nutrition and diet, physical activity, sleep, and stress management. Despite their efficacy,
lifestyle medicine programs are constrained by high attrition rates. Adjunctive interventions to increase
retention can be deployed if accurate forecasting algorithms are developed to identify who is most likely to drop
out. Previous studies found a host of demographic and behavioral risk factors for attrition. However, none are
sufficiently strong individually to accurately predict future dropout, and they have not yet been combined into a
validated predictive algorithm. Furthermore, recent technological advances made it possible to identify new
powerful predictors of dropout using objective, passively sensed data (natural language, sleep, and
movement). However, the utility of these passively sensed data for predicting attrition has not been rigorously
proven. To address these gaps, the goal of the current project is to identify psychological and behavioral
factors assessed from self-report, medical exams, and passive sensing that predict attrition in a lifestyle
medicine program. We will use existing infrastructure within the WTC Health Program at Stony Brook
University to assess 800 WTC responders as they enroll in an established 3-month lifestyle medicine program.
At program intake, we will (a) assess established risk factors, (b) record the first treatment visit to obtain
natural language predictors, and (c) give participants a FitBit to wear for 1 week to measure physical activity
and sleep patterns via passive sensing. Our aims are to (1) identify individual predictors of attrition in a lifestyle
medicine program and (2) combine predictors to develop an algorithm to forecast attrition (using machine
learning methods). This study will improve our ability to identify patients at risk of attrition and also characterize
profile of dropout risk across many potential predictors, revealing pathways to attrition that can be targeted by
supportive interventions in future studies (e.g., motivational interviewing, just-in-time adaptive interventions
based on passive sensing data). The proposed project takes the first step to address the problem of high
attrition in lifestyle medicine programs among WTC responders and other patient populations. It will pave the
way for randomized clinical trials of supportive interventions with patients identified by the algorithm as likely to
drop out."
10928083,"Prostate cancer is a disease with a remarkably high impact on Veteran health. Not only is it the
most common cancer diagnosed in Veterans, with nearly 15,000 new cases diagnosed each year,
but Veteran men get diagnosed with prostate cancer at nearly twice the rate of the general
population 1. Unfortunately, even with treatment, many of these Veterans will ultimately die from
their disease. New, effective treatments are therefore desperately needed to improve outcomes
for Veterans with prostate cancer. Although the development of new prostate cancer research is
currently under way, the development of such therapies is heavily limited by current preclinical
research models, which do a notoriously poor job of identifying therapies that will be effective at
the clinical level. We have therefore developed a novel open microfluidic cell culture platform that
enables multi-culture tumor models in vitro using primary, patient-derived cells. The central
hypothesis in this proposal is that primary cell derived multi-culture TME models in Stacks will
more closely model patient tumor biology and can better predict clinical therapeutic efficacy in
prostate cancer than traditional preclinical models. The primary objective of this proposal will be
to test this hypothesis through three Specific Aims: Aim 1: To determine whether the gene
expression profiles of prostate tumor cells in multi-culture Stacks models more closely
correlate with patient expression profiles than tumor cells in traditional in vitro models.
Tumor cells (cell line and patient-derived organoids) will be cultured in traditional in vitro platforms
in mono-culture and in co-culture with primary macrophages/cancer-associated fibroblasts. The
same mono- and co-culture models will also be established in Stacks along with the addition of a
tri-culture model with all 3 cell populations. RNA-seq will then be performed on the tumor cells
from each model. Transcription profiles will be compared to patient datasets to determine which
model most closely correlates with patient tumors. Aim 2: To establish whether multi-culture
tumor models in Stacks can more accurately predict the efficacy of therapies in patients
with prostate cancer than standard in vitro models. Using the same models in Aim 1, each
model will be treated with 3 therapies known to be effective in patients with prostate cancer and
3 therapies known to be ineffective in patients with prostate cancer. The cytotoxic effect of the
therapies will be evaluated in each model and compared to clinical trial data to determine which
system most accurately predicts therapeutic efficacy at the clinical level. Aim 3: To evaluate
whether patient-derived TME models in Stacks can predict therapeutic response to
docetaxel in Veterans with prostate cancer. Co-culture models will be established in Stacks
using tumor cell lines and primary monocyte-derived macrophages from Veterans with prostate
cancer about to initiate docetaxel treatment. Stacks models will then be treated with docetaxel
and evaluated for the cytotoxic effect of the treatment. The data from each patient-derived Stacks
model will then be compared to the docetaxel response in the corresponding patient to determine
if the Stacks co-culture models can predict therapeutic response in patients. The data from each
of the Aims will be analyzed to determine if multi-culture models are more biologically and clinically
relevant and if the Stacks platform is a more effective tool than traditional in vitro platforms for
translational prostate cancer research."

The public health burden of Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD) has prompted clinical trials of deep brain
stimulation (DBS) that have, unfortunately, produced inconsistent outcomes. Potential gaps and opportunities
include a need: (1) to better understand the neurocircuitry of the disease; (2) for precision DBS devices that
can target brain networks in a clinically and physiologically validated manner; and (3) for greater insight into
stimulation dose-response relationships. These needs are based on our overarching hypothesis that network-
guided neuromodulation is critical for the efficacy of DBS in TRD. This project aims to address the unmet need
of TRD patients by identifying brain networks critical for treating depression and to use next generation
precision DBS with steering capability to engage these targeted networks and develop a new therapy
for TRD. We use the Boston Scientific (BS) Vercise DBS system, which offers a segmented steerable lead
with multiple independent current sources that allows true directional steering. Moreover, this system
integrates stimulation field modeling (SFM) with MR tractography to predict network engagement. We use an
innovative approach of targeting both subgenual cingulate (SGC) and ventral capsule/ventral striatum
(VC/VS), which we term corticomesolimbic DBS. These targets are hubs in distinct yet partially overlapping
depression networks and emerging basic science literature implicates them in bidirectional modulation of
depression circuits. We also apply a paradigm-shifting approach using intracranial stereo-EEG (sEEG)
subacutely after DBS implant to evaluate the clinical reliability of steering, SFMs, and tractography and to
define and then target the networks mediating symptoms of depression. In Aim 1, in the Epilepsy Monitoring
Unit (EMU), we investigate the capability of Vercise to selectively engage distinct brain networks and compare
the spatial distribution of evoked network activity and modulation with that predicted by SFM and tractography.
In Aim 2, we conduct further studies in the EMU to delineate depression-relevant networks and show
behavioral changes with network-targeted stimulation. We use a variety of tasks to probe different symptom
domains and novel assessment tools (Computerized Adaptive Testing and Automated Facial Affect
Recognition) to enhance classification and model algorithms to optimize stimulation patterns. In Aim 3, we
bring the results from Aims 1 and 2 together, to test the therapeutic potential of corticomesolimbic DBS in 12
subjects with TRD, with a focus on safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy in a 8-month open label trial with
a subsequent randomized, blinded withdrawal of stimulation to assess efficacy. The impact of this proposal
includes physiological validation of current “steering” DBS technology to target specific networks, insights into
effects of stimulation parameters on network physiology, an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of
depression, and, perhaps most importantly, a novel approach for treating TRD. This research will also pioneer
a novel and high-yield test bed for DBS therapy development consistent with BRAIN priorities."

10796868,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rationale: Sexual violence (SV) statistics are staggering: 1 in 3 women and 1 in 6 men has experienced sexual
violence in their lifetime. For SV survivors, cancer care can be triggering and retraumatizing due to perceived
similarities between aspects of cancer treatment and the original SV (e.g., being asked to undress, lie still,
being touched by authority figures). This triggering and retraumatization can be associated with non-adherence
to cancer screening and treatment. Yet despite the prevalence of SV and the negative effects it can have on
patients' cancer treatment experiences, training in working with SV survivors is not a standard component of
cancer care providers' education. Objectives: The goal of the proposed R25E is to train a multidisciplinary
group of cancer care providers in sensitive practice skills for working with survivors of SV. The proposed
Sensitive Practice Training (SPT) Program will teach providers to help their SV survivor patients to feel as safe
and empowered as possible during cancer screening and treatment. The program would be the first,
nationwide, sensitive practice training program of its kind. The training format for the SPT program is blended
learning, combining E-Learning and a two-day live workshop. The faculty represents multiple disciplines
including psychology, radiation oncology, radiation therapy, and physical therapy. The Specific Aims are to: 1)
evaluate trainee accrual to, retention in, and satisfaction with our SPT training program; 2) evaluate the
effectiveness of the SPT program on trainees' sensitive practice knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy for using
these skills in practice; and, 3) evaluate the impact of the SPT program on trainees' real-world practice using a
mixed-methods approach. The SPT content is guided by Schachter's “Umbrella of Safety” principles (respect,
rapport, taking time, sharing information, sharing control, respecting boundaries, mutual learning,
understanding non-linear healing, demonstrating an understanding of sexual violence). The evaluation plan for
the SPT program is guided by Miller's pyramid of clinical competencies, and will focus on four levels of
evaluation: knowledge, competence, performance, and action. Evaluations will be linked to each training
module, and will be administered prior to, during, and 3 months after program participation. Methods: A
multidisciplinary group of cancer care providers (N=200; including medical, nursing, allied health, and
psychosocial providers) from across the country will be recruited via professional organizations and
conferences. Long-term goals: By training a large cohort of cancer care providers in sensitive practice
techniques, the proposed R25E is a critical first step toward enhancing the ability of the cancer care workforce
to meet the needs of SV survivors undergoing cancer care, a large and largely overlooked group. Connection
to NCI mission: This project is consistent with NCI's emphasis on promoting health care quality and optimizing
communication between clinicians and patients."
10815545,"Objective: More effective treatment options are needed across all clinical stages of colorectal cancer (CRC),
from eliminating residual disease after surgery, improving surgical candidacy and developing more effective
treatment options for metastatic disease. Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT), which targets tumor-specific
biomarkers, has been one appealing approach in the pursuit of effective cancer therapeutics. The development
of low-molecular-weight TRT agents is particularly attractive due to their rapid targeting and non-target clearance
properties. However, for many investigated low-molecular-weight TRT agents, the short residence time in tumors
due to inherently high clearance rates of the agents and their metabolites inhibits clinical translation. The purpose
of this proposal is to design a CRC therapeutic agent capable of targeting the neurotensin receptor subtype 1
(NTSR1), a receptor found to be overexpressed in large segments of the CRC patient population. Specifically,
by incorporating irreversible cysteine protease trapping agents (CPTAs) into the structure of NTSR1-targeted
agents (NTSR1TAs), we seek to design TRTs that are capable of forming high molecular weight intracellular
adducts. Through this retention mechanism, the 177Lu-labeled, CPTA-incorporated, NTSR1TAs (177Lu-CPTA-
NTSR1TAs) will exhibit substantial increases in radiation dose delivery leading to enhanced therapeutic efficacy.
Also, as part of this grant, we seek to gain a clearer understanding of the in vivo adduct binding partners, adduct
half-lives and tissue/cellular localization associated with this trapping mechanism.
Specific Aims: (1) Synthesis and Initial Biological Performance of 177Lu-CPTA-NTSR1-targeted Agents; (2)
Examine In Vivo Adduct Protease Profiles, Adduct Half-lives and Tissue Distribution; and (3) Therapeutic
Evaluation of Optimized 177Lu-CPTA-NTSR1-targeted Agents
Study Design: The first aim of this proposal is to examine pathways to further improve the design of CRC
residualizing 177Lu-CPTA-NTSR1TAs by 1) refining the construct to reduce T/K radiation dose ratios; 2) exploring
the impact of CPTAs with varying selectivities; and 3) examining different cysteine protease inhibitor classes.
After synthesis, initial assessments regarding the in vitro and in vivo performance of the177Lu-CPTA-NTSR1TAs
will be performed. In the second aim, a more detailed biological evaluation will be carried out in which adduct-
binding partners are identified and quantified, tissue protease expression levels ascertained, adduct half-lives
are estimated and cellular distribution (percent intracellular, membrane or extracellular) determined. Lastly, lead
TRT candidates will be examined in advanced CRC mouse models to determine the best candidates to move
forward to the maximum tolerated dose and therapeutic efficacy studies. At the end of this project, we anticipate
being able to identify a candidate to advance towards FDA investigational new drug approval."

This renewal application seeks support for our well-established research education program in substance use
disorders to support undergraduate students pursuing short-term summer research experiences at the Medical
University of South Carolina (MUSC). The goal is to develop the next generation of independent researchers
who can progressively enhance existing therapies and develop novel approaches to substance use disorders.
The specific aims are to: 1) Foster interest in these talented and highly motivated students to pursue careers in
biomedical research in the areas of addiction research by providing a forum where accomplished investigators
can be mentors sharing their enthusiasm and expertise; 2) Leverage existing research training programs at
MUSC to complement and expand the overall experience of the students; 3) Provide a forum where students
not only acquire the basics of how to address research problems, but also learn cutting edge research
techniques, research ethics, and presentation of research data; 4) Contribute to enhancing the students' overall
science literacy by nurturing an appreciation of the nature of science and acquisition of socioscientific skills and
values.; and 5) Implement a comprehensive evaluation plan that measures the degree to which the program is
achieving its objectives. Each year, fourteen undergraduate students will have the opportunity to conduct
biomedical research projects under the guidance of faculty mentors based primarily in the Department of
Neuroscience. The ten-week summer research projects conducted by the students will culminate in a formal
scientific presentation. Additional activities include a lecture series on focused topics; a research ethics
component; formal and informal discussions on the meaning of scientific literacy, professional development and
career opportunities; and social functions. The participating faculty constitutes a highly collaborative,
interdisciplinary team of laboratory-based researchers. Training opportunities are thematically organized around
four areas of research: neurobiological basis of cocaine relapse; neurobiology of methamphetamine
dependence; sex and gender related research in substance use disorders; and stress and substance use
disorders. The program builds upon and leverages (1) MUSC's strong and continued commitment to research
training; (2) its excellent reputation in providing meaningful research experiences for talented undergraduate
students; (3) its record of accomplishment of attracting students from underrepresented groups and
undergraduate institutions, and (4) its effective program management. This R25 program will teach and promote
the integration of clinical and basic science knowledge, with an emphasis on acquiring research skills in the basic
neurobiology of substance use."
10744723,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Taste family 1 receptors (T1Rs, forming sweet and umami receptors) and taste family 2 receptors
(T2Rs, forming bitter receptors) are important G-protein couple receptors (GPCRs) expressed in taste buds of
the tongue. T1Rs and T2Rs also play important chemosensory roles in tissues all over the body, including the
airway epithelium and in immune cells. We and other have characterized T1Rs and T2Rs as novel players in
innate immunity. They detect bacterial metabolites to stimulate rapid innate immune responses.
 While current screening methods have revealed a lot about specific agonists that activate specific T1Rs
and T2Rs, understanding T1R and T2R activation by complex mixtures (e.g., plant extracts or conditioned
media from bacteria) is currently very difficult. Existing screening methods are focused on calcium signaling as
a read-out. Many compounds activate calcium signals independently of taste receptors in cultured cells, and
the HEK293 cells commonly used express endogenous T2Rs. Calcium-focused screening methods have also
likely missed “biased agonists,” that is, agonists which do not activate T2R G protein signaling but activate
arrestin signaling. This has been reported for many GPCRs, but no one has yet screened for biased agonists
of taste receptors. This is a critical gap in the studies of T1R and T2R biology that will be addressed here.
 To overcome limitations of calcium-based assays and reveal new insights into T2R-arrestin signaling,
we will adapt a fluorescence-based tripartite GFP-based assay (known as the TRIO assay) that directly
visualizes heterologously-expressed receptor activation through arrestin binding to the activated receptor. This
assay is much less limited by off-target effects of complex mixtures or single compounds compared with
current methods. It is also adaptable to high throughput plate-reader instrumentation. This assay is faster (1-2
hrs) than other GPCR assays which rely on transcription as a readout (12-24 hrs). We have utilized this assay
to study activation and inhibition of protease-activated and adrenergic receptors in prior studies. Preliminary
data suggest this assay works well with T2Rs. We hypothesize that T1R and T2R TRIO assays will reveal
novel ligand-T1R/T2R interactions and may be useful to de-orphanize the remaining orphan T2R isoforms.
 In this proposal, Aim 1 will focus on validation of this optical assay using known bitter and sweet
compounds. Aim 2 will use this assay to screen taste receptors against common pathogenic bacteria and
fungi to characterize which receptors are activated by which pathogens. New clinically relevant data will be
revealed, and the expression constructs validated in this study will become useful tools for taste receptor
research. All expression vectors will be made widely available via Addgene after initial publication. This
research has important utility for both immune research as well as molecular sensory nutrition and taste
research."
10756155,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Racial/ethnic minority children who undergo surgery have worse clinical outcomes compared to white or more
affluent peers. Although clinical and environmental determinants contribute to these disparities, evidence
suggests that these disparities may rise in part from racial/ethnic differences in relationships and communication
between surgical clinicians and parents, which are a potentially remediable source of healthcare inequities. The
importance of physician-family communication is particularly significant in the milieu of pediatric surgical care,
where patients and parents may perceive surgeons as intimidating, paternalistic, or dismissive relative to other
specialists. The goal of our project is to develop an innovative, valid, and scalable measurement and analytic
approaches for better understanding of patient-physician interactions. Findings will inform development of
interventions to improve communication and thereby enhance quality of equity of pediatric surgical care delivery.
This proposal focuses on two innovative features of communication: linguistic style matching (LSM) and linguistic
accommodation. LSM is the tendency of participants to use a common vocabulary and speech structure, while
linguistic accommodation is the process by which participants in a conversation adjust their language according
to the speech style of the other participant. Both LSM and linguistic accommodation have been rarely explored
and are potential mechanisms by which less social/cultural distance can result in higher quality relationships and
outcomes. Using a mixed-methods sequential explanatory study design, we apply computerized text analysis
tools and subsequent thematic content analysis of clinician-parent interactions during pediatric surgical
consultations to (1) Elucidate dimensions of parent and clinician linguistic style and generate novel measures of
LSM and linguistic accommodation in pediatric surgical care, (2) Evaluate the convergent and predictive validity
of LSM and linguistic accommodation, and (3) Explore dialogue examples and themes from visits where clinician
linguistic style dimensions are associated with higher and lower parent ratings of surgical clinicians.
We apply quantitative and qualitative methodology to wholly understand the significance and potential
contribution of LSM and linguistic accommodation to bridging social distance in communication. We propose
generating communication measures through automated text analysis versus traditional manual coding. Theis
innovative approach can elucidate mechanisms by which surgical clinicians can communicate more effectively
and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in surgical outcomes, provide initial validity evidence for novel communication
analytic methods, expand the cost-effectiveness and scale of communication analysis studies of physician-
parent interaction, and inform development of real-time feedback systems for surgical clinicians to improve their
interactions over time. Because each surgical clinician sees many patients, small improvements in clinicians’
relationship and communication skills can have a large effect on improving quality and equity in patient outcomes."
10737647,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Beside the well‐researched antibiotic resistance, bacterial pathogens can survive antibiotic exposure through
drug persistence. Persistence has been more difficult to study because of the transiency of the phenomenon,
where some bacteria arrest growth, thus surviving several antibiotics. Resumption of growth by persister is
thought to account for infection relapses but this has never been directly tested or demonstrated. With this
proposal, we aim at answering the fundamental question: are persisters the future “relapsors” and thereby
constitute a real reservoir for relapse of infections? In this project, we will make use of a remarkably useful model
intracellular pathogen, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to establish whether Salmonella persisters are
directly responsible for infection relapse. This proposal leverages further the development by our lab of model
systems and tools to track persisters in the context of infection. First, in Aim 1 of this project, we will adapt a
CRISPR‐based recorder that we recently built in the lab to record in the bacterial genome of persisters the state
of growth‐arrest, thus leaving an indelible genetic scar in CRISPR arrays that is perpetuated and detectable in
their progeny. We will further characterize this tool during infection of primary murine macrophages to
determine if, in addition to recording growth arrest, it can also be used as recorder of length of growth arrest.
We will also adapt pSCRATCH to record other signals in addition to growth arrest. Then, in Aim 2, we will use
the growth‐arrest recorder to assess for Salmonella, for the first time, whether persisters are the direct reservoir
for bacterial regrowth during relapse. This Aim will enable us to determine where relapsors originate from, from
growth‐arrested persisters or few growers not eradicated by the drugs for other reasons, such as lack of antibiotic
accessibility. It is of the utmost importance to determine whether persisters are the major source of infecting
bacteria during relapse in order to efficiently target persistent infections with improved therapeutics and
counteract the generation of antibiotic resistance."

The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of orally delivering Lactobacillus paracasei genetically
modified to express Angiotensin (1-7) (LP-A) on Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that
LP-A treatment at the onset of pathology will significantly slow or delay accumulation of pTau and Aβ, markers
of inflammation, loss of noradrenergic axons, and hippocampal synaptic dysfunction in TgF344-AD rats that is
dependent upon activation of Mas receptors. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that LP-A treatment improves
performance in hippocampus-dependent behavioral assays and decreases anxiety in TgF344-AD rats that is
dependent upon activation of Mas receptors. ANTICIPATED IMPACT: To date, proven treatments for preventing
age- and AD mediated cognitive decline are lacking, thus research on potentially efficacious interventions is
desperately needed. This study holds tremendous potential for generating proof of concept data that an orally-
provided intervention improves or prevents deficits in synaptic circuit and cognitive function. The work is
significant because it addresses several clinical and public health problems deemed critical by the NIH.
Innovations in the project include the conceptual approach using genetic engineering techniques to deliver
therapeutic compounds in probiotic form, and the study design which lays the groundwork for future translation
to humans to ultimately help address the massive health burden of AD related cognitive decline."
10828927,"A growing body of evidence points to the gut-bone axis as a promising therapeutic target for postmenopausal
osteoporosis. Ovarian hormone deficiency induces a gut microbiota-dependent shift in effector T cell
populations (e.g., T helper 17 [Th17] and T regulatory [TREG] cells) within the gut and bone marrow that disrupt
bone homeostasis and lead to bone loss. Although the gut microbiota is recognized for playing a critical role in
this osteoimmunological response, little is known about the signaling of gut resident dendritic cells that
translates these local effects into systemic T cell responses. Prebiotics such as oligosaccharides serve as
substrates for microorganisms residing within the gut. Fermentation of oligosaccharides by gut microbiota
yields metabolites that favorably affect intestinal epithelial cells lining the mucosa and immune cells within the
gut lymphoid tissues. The investigation of the mechanisms of prebiotic-induced immune and bone responses
has been met with experimental challenges, namely those encountered when studying the interactions
between multiple physiological systems. In this R21 project, we propose to study the dendritic cell-mediated
bone and T cell responses to estrogen deficiency and to B-galactooligosaccharides (B-GOS) prebiotic dietary
invention in the periphery (bone and blood) and locally in the gut using a combination of in silico
mathematical models and in vivo animal models. The mathematical model we will develop will focus on the
interacting systems modulated by B-GOS and by estrogen through T cells and dendritic cells. The model will
use differential equations to track immune cells, cytokines, hormones, and metabolites in the gut and
peripheral blood and bone compartments. The model will build from our literature-informed preliminary
model of the interactions in the gut-bone axis in response to dietary intervention and will be refined by
comparison to the experimental data collected in the study, specifically adding the roles of dendritic cells,
estrogen, and different T cell populations. In addition to protein analysis of the cytokines and metabolites
obtained from in vivo studies, we will use computational deconvolution methods to infer cell type-specific
transcriptional profiles from heterogeneous samples. The transcriptomics data is intended to provide more
comprehensive immune response information than flow cytometry alone and to be exploratory of cellular
interactions excluded from the preliminary computational model, e.g., dendritic cells. This project is designed
to provide key data about the dendritic cell and T cell immune responses stimulated by dietary B-GOS
supplementation in both intact and ovarian hormone deficient animal models. Successful completion of this
project will yield a predictive mathematical model that can be used as a tool to explain possible mechanisms
for how local gut stimuli and immune responses interact to yield peripheral phenotype changes, to inform the
design of future experiments, and to identify critical control points within the gut-bone axis for designing and
optimizing treatment strategies."
10796817,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Ryanodine receptor-mediated calcium release plays an essential role in muscle contraction, and disruption of
calcium homeostasis in excitable tissues caused by RyR-mediated calcium leak causes several genetic
diseases, as well as contributing to the progressive loss of muscle function that occurs with aging. RyRs are
tetrameric ion channels of unusually large size, with each subunit bearing a large cytosolic region that acts as a
scaffold for the binding of allosteric modulators, which regulate the channel by binding at sites far from the
transmembrane pore. The mechanistic basis of long-range allosteric modulation of RyR1 activity is not well
understood. Understanding how allosteric regulators modulate RyR1 will both inform our understanding of RyR
in a physiological context, and facilitate the development of molecules that target the channel to treat RyR1
related diseases. The goal of our proposal is to understand the structural mechanism of action of RyR1 allosteric
modulators using single particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), complemented by functional analysis.
We will investigate calmodulin and dantrolene as examples of long-range allosteric modulators which are
endogenous protein binding partners and small molecule ligands, respectively. We will tackle this goal from three
directions. In Aim 1, we seek to obtain a complete atomic model of RyR1, including of the peripheral domains
where allosteric modulators bind, which have largely eluded sequence assignment due to their flexibility and
mobility. We will apply a combination of symmetry expansion and masked refinement to generate a combined
reconstruction with improved local resolution in peripheral regions, as well as explore optimization of sample
preparation to obtain a more homogeneous particle set. In Aim 2, we will obtain structures of RyR1 in multiple
functional states in complex with calmodulin and apocalmodulin, and to use single channel recordings of mutants
of both calmodulin and RyR1 to test hypotheses arising from these structures. In Aim 3, we will investigate the
mechanism of allosteric inhibition of RyR1 by dantrolene, by first structurally identifying the dantrolene binding
site, and then examining the interdependence between inhibition by dantrolene and regulation by calmodulin,
magnesium and ATP. Our research will broadly impact the field by unraveling the structural basis of allosteric
regulation of an essential ion channel, RyR1. Structural characterization of the dantrolene binding site may lead
the way to structure-based design of new RyR1 targeting therapeutics for the treatment of malignant
hyperthermia and RyR1-related myopathies."

Across the globe, there has been a considerable growth in the number of people diagnosed with Parkinsonism.
Estimates indicate that from 1990 to 2015 the number of Parkinsonism diagnoses doubled, with more than 6
million people currently carrying the diagnosis, and by year 2040, 12 and 14.2 million people will be diagnosed
with Parkinsonism. Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy Parkinsonian variant (MSAp), and
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are neurodegenerative forms of Parkinsonism, which can be difficult to
diagnose as they share similar motor and non-motor features, and they each have an increased chance of
developing dementia. In the first five years of a PD diagnosis, about 58% of PD are misdiagnosed, and of these
misdiagnoses about half have either MSA or PSP. Since PD, MSAp, and PSP require unique treatment plans
and different medications, and clinical trials testing new medications require the correct diagnosis, there is an
urgent need for both clinic ready and clinical-trial ready markers for differential diagnosis of PD, MSAp, and PSP.
Over the past decade, we have developed diffusion imaging as an innovative biomarker for differentiating PD,
MSAp, and PSP. In this proposal, we will leverage our extensive experience to create a web-based software tool
that can process diffusion imaging data from anywhere in the world. We will disseminate and test the tool in the
largest prospective cohort of participants with Parkinsonism (PD, MSAp, PSP), working closely with the
Parkinson Study Group. The reason to test this in the Parkinson Study Group network, is because they are the
community that evaluates Phase II and Phase III clinical trials in Parkinsonism. This web-based software tool
will be capable of reading raw diffusion imaging data, performing quality assurance procedures, analyzing the
data using a validated pipeline, and providing imaging metrics and diagnostic probability. We will test the
performance of the wAID-P by enrolling 315 total subjects (105 PD, 105 MSAp, 105 PSP) across 21 sites in the
Parkinson Study Group. Each site will perform imaging, clinical scales, diagnosis, and will upload the data to
the web-based software tool. The clinical diagnosis will be blinded to the diagnostic algorithm and the imaging
diagnosis will be compared to the movement disorders trained neurologist diagnosis. We will also enroll a portion
of the cohort into a brain bank to ascertain pathological confirmation and to test the algorithm against cases with
post-mortem diagnoses. The final outcome will be to disseminate a validated diagnostic algorithm to the
Parkinson neurological and radiological community and to make it available to all on a website."

Guided by current prediction models utilized to address and prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(CVD), the proposed project investigates how gender identity and hormone therapy are related to
cardiovascular health in transgender adults. The projects three specific aims are to: 1) evaluate a robust
method of identifying transgender individuals within claims data and compare this method to the gold-standard
of self-identification with data from Fenway Health, a federally qualified health center and leader in transgender
health; 2) assess current prediction models for CVD (i.e., Pooled Cohort Risk Assessment Equation) utilizing
C statistics, net reclassification, and integrated discrimination index for transgender individuals by accounting
for sex assigned at birth, gender identity, and use of exogenous hormones.; and 3) examine the knowledge
and attitudes of 160 transgender adult regarding potential risks associated with hormone therapy and
perceived barriers, facilitators, and acceptability of interventions affecting cardiovascular health. Completing
the proposed aims will 1) improve the accuracy of research with administrative data; 2) enhance clinical
decision-making for transgender adults seeking hormone therapy; and 3) inform risk mitigation strategies to
improve cardiovascular health of transgender adults. By engaging in mentored research with Drs. Emelia
Benjamin (Mentor), Michael Paasche-Orlow (Mentor), Howard Cabral (Mentor), and Sari Reisner (Mentor), and
collaborators, completing coursework, and participating in seminars, conferences, and regular mentoring
meetings, I will develop expertise in four new areas critical to my development as an independent clinician-
scientist evaluating health outcomes to characterize and mitigate CVD risks for transgender individuals: 1)
Quantitative methods to analyze claims-based & electronic health record data; 2) Quantitative methods to
assess prediction models; 3) Clinical skills in transgender endocrinology, cardiology, & preventive care; and 4)
Qualitative research & community engagement skills. Moreover, I will extend my grant writing and oral
presentation skills by participating in grant writing courses and presenting at research meetings and
seminars. Boston University offers junior scholars with the intellectual and practical resources they need to
develop into successful independent investigators, including junior faculty seminars, grant writing, editing, and
review services, and opportunities for intellectual exchange and collaboration with senior colleagues. A K01
award will provide me with the research experience, skills, and mentorship I need to build a cutting-edge
independent research program that assesses and addresses cardiovascular health in sexual and gender
minorities, particularly transgender adults."
11159205,"Pathological inflammation is a source of substantial morbidity underlying clinically diverse diseases that are
marked by irreversible tissue damage. Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a prevalent inflammatory skin disease
that shares features with these other disorders, including repeated bouts of unprovoked inflammation causing
pain, hyperplasia, aberrant healing, and fibrosis. HS is debilitating, difficult to manage, and has many unmet
medical needs. Notably, HS is in dire need of new treatments, with the lone FDA-approved drug failing to illicit a
clinical response in ~35% of patients. Human genetic studies help to identify and prioritize drug targets and
improve drug development success rates. However, relatively few human genetic studies have been performed
for HS and these have been conducted in small cohorts. Furthermore, although African Americans are at three
times the risk of HS, they have been excluded from those studies. Importantly, no GWAS or exome wide studies
have been published for HS. To date, four monogenic etiologies have been described for HS, one of which
implicates an inborn error of immunity (IEI). IEI are single-gene disorders comprising a class of nearly 500
extensively studied genes that cause improper function of the immune system, resulting in pathological
inflammation, autoimmunity, and/or increased susceptibility to infection. IEI underlie a range of phenotypes that
span multi-organ dysfunction to more focal outcomes, and some include HS and/or clinical features that overlap
with HS. There is immunological and clinical overlap between HS and IEI, and yet IEI have not been rigorously
investigated with HS genetic studies. Furthermore, IEI contribute to the genetic architecture of prevalent
multifactorial disorders and can have important clinical implications for the patients that harbor them by
presenting opportunities for targeted interventions and individualized screening. As was found to be the case for
other inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and atopic dermatitis, we hypothesize IEI are
important components of HS pathogenesis. Specifically, we will first test the hypothesis that some people with
an HS diagnosis have an IEI by generating exome data and performing a diagnostic analysis followed by
validation of identified mutations. Next, we will test the hypothesis that IEI pathways are a component of HS
pathogenesis. We will use burden testing with exome data and genome-wide association studies to identify
genes, pathways, and cell types that are relevant to HS and then determine the prevalence of IEI genes and
pathways in HS. Our approach is to leverage large HS cohorts with ancestral diversity that we have built with
clinical collaborators who specialize in HS treatment and industry partners running HS clinical trials. The
successful completion of these studies will help to identify subsets of HS research participants with IEI (some of
which will have immediate clinical relevance), will determine the prevalence of IEI in HS, and will identify IEI
pathways that are relevant to HS patients without an IEI. Together these results will provide the rationale for drug
repurposing in HS and may also help to improve strategies for managing pathogenic inflammation."

Major depressive disorder (MDD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are comorbid. Acute alcohol decreases both
anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. Chronic alcohol exposure increases both of these negative emotion-
like behaviors. In fact, decades of epidemiological data suggest that individuals use alcohol to alleviate a
negative affective state. Whether the negative emotional state is due to MDD or repeated alcohol exposure
(AUD), researchers are now beginning to examine how mechanisms that are initially positive and rewarding
shift toward negative affect/anhedonia during withdrawal. For example, much is known about the neural
circuitry and neurotransmitter/peptide systems underlying acute and chronic effects of alcohol on anxiety-like
behaviors. Surprisingly, much less attention has been directed at the negative affective (anhedonia)
component. Our preclinical work suggests that acute ethanol treatment produces an antidepressant-like effect
and hijacks the same biochemical pathway as NMDAR antagonists. Pivotal to ethanol and NMDAR
antagonists’ antidepressant efficacy is the dynamic expression of the RNA-binding protein Fragile X Mental
Retardation Protein (FMRP). Reduction in FMRP expression allows for the upregulation of transsynaptic
proteins that promote new synapse formation and antidepressant-like effects. Consistent with a shift from
positive to negative emotion-like behaviors, FMRP is upregulated during withdrawal in ethanol-dependent
animals. Using molecular, biochemical, and electrophysiological techniques, combined with a novel synapse
detection assay that we developed in our laboratory (DetectSyn), and the expertise of our collaborators in the
Weiner laboratory in preclinical models of alcohol dependence, we will determine in Specific Aim 1 if acute
ethanol regulates the binding of FMRP to transsynaptic mRNAs, regulates the synaptic protein synthesis of
these target mRNAs, and promotes new synapse formation. Moreover, in Specific Aim 2 we will determine if
the FMRP-regulated antidepressant signaling pathway is muted or suppressed during the WD/negative affect
state, and if acute ethanol treatment can reverse the biochemical and behavioral depressive phenotypes.
Furthermore, we will isolate and sequence FMRP target mRNAs that are repressed during WD but released
due to treatment with acute ethanol during WD. Using a computational/genomic approach such as the Library
of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures – a method that has shown promise in AUD research – these
data will facilitate future studies using these targets to predict effective, repurposed FDA-approved drugs to
treat AUD and MDD. These studies will lay the foundation for future pharmacological intervention to treat
negative affect during WD in alcohol-dependent individuals with comorbid MDD."
10874391,"Chronic pain is common among Veterans and remains an unmet medical need. Voltage-gated sodium
channels (NaVs) that are expressed preferentially in primary afferents play a critical role in human pain
disorders, and present opportune targets for the development of novel pain treatments that carry minimal CNS
side effects and addictive potential. NaV1.7 is a peripheral threshold channel that regulates action potential
firing and neurotransmitter release. Our work for the past 15 years has linked NaV1.7 to human pain disorders,
e.g., inherited erythromelalgia, small fiber neuropathy, painful diabetic neuropathy, and validated NaV 1.7 as a
highly attractive target for the treatment of pain. Although considerable progress has been made in the
development of novel NaV1.7 blockers for the treatment of pain, much work is needed to improve their
specificity and efficacy. Similarly, while existing NaV blockers can provide symptomatic relief in patients, their
utility is limited due to non-specificity and significant CNS side effects.
Gabapentinoids, the current first line treatment for chronic pain, inhibit trafficking of presynaptic voltage-gated
calcium channel to the plasma membrane or disrupt Rab11-dependent recycling, thus reducing calcium
currents and transmitter release. By analogy to gabapentinoids' mode of action for the treatment of pain, and
recent focus on trafficking proteins as therapeutic targets in CNS disorder, targeting trafficking machinery of
Nav1.7 might represent a novel approach to pain treatment. However, little is known about molecules and
mechanisms that control sodium channel trafficking and surface distribution along the length of sensory
axons—a target of opportunity that we explore in this proposal.
In this proposal, we aim to elucidate molecular mechanisms that control trafficking of NaV1.7 and their
distribution in the axonal plasma membrane of sensory neurons, in an effort to identify potential new targets for
the treatment of chronic pain. Specifically, we will build upon a powerful new platform that we developed, that
enables real-time imaging of single sodium channels within living sensory neurons at a distance from the soma
with unprecedented spatial- and temporal-resolution.
Knowledge gleaned from these studies will provide unprecedented clarity about mechanisms that regulate sub-
cellular distribution of sodium channels in sensory neurons, particularly along the length of axons, in normal
and disease states. These studies, in turn, will enable discovery of new targets for treatment of chronic pain.
Our ultimate goal is to develop safer and more effective treatments without addictive potential and other
serious side effects."
10840860,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The development of clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a process that occurs across the lifespan, beginning
early in life and spanning late into life as clinical event rates increase. Much of our understanding of the impact
of cardiovascular risk factors comes from studies examining the association between risk factor levels measured
at a single point in time, often in middle age, with incident disease over the short- to intermediate-term. However,
risk factor levels in young adulthood are signiﬁcantly associated with the development of CVD later in life and
our recent work has demonstrated that not only the levels at speciﬁc ages, but also cumulative exposures and
long-term trajectories in cardiovascular health are signiﬁcantly related to the risk for subsequent CVD. Therefore,
a life course approach is critical in order to understand how cardiovascular risk factors develop and impact an
individual's risk for CVD events later in life. Yet there is no single study that has collected detailed phenotypic
data spanning young adulthood through old age on a broadly representative sample of the U.S. population.
 In response to NOT-HL-19-712: Innovative Data Evaluation and Analysis to Health, we propose to de-
velop a statistical framework for combining longitudinal risk factors and clinical outcomes data from multiple
cohort studies to create a “synthetic cohort” enabling the study of long-term cardiovascular health starting in
early adulthood. The investigative team of this proposal has pooled the data from 20 community-based CVD
cohorts through the Lifetime Risk Pooling Project (LRPP), which now has >11 million person-years of follow-
up data on repeated measures of CVD risk factors, detailed information about medication use (including blood
pressure- and cholesterol-lowering therapy), nearly 100% follow-up for vital status, and detailed CVD event adju-
dication. Few cohorts in the LRPP cover the entire adult lifespan; therefore, we propose to view risk factors and
outcomes at ages not included in each cohort study as missing data, and to use multiple imputation to ﬁll in these
unobserved measurements to facilitate analysis. The overall goal of this project is to identify and measure
the characteristics of CVD risk factor trajectories across the adult lifespan that are most amenable to
intervention. Measuring these characteristics can help identify critical periods for intervention, more precisely
deﬁne thresholds for known risk factors, elucidate the role of lifestyle behaviors, explain differences in health
among populations, and promote CVD prevention strategies at younger ages. Our speciﬁc aims are: 1) Develop
and validate a statistical framework for imputing unobserved CVD risk factors and events across the lifespan
using data from the LRPP; 2) Inform treatment strategies by identifying clinically relevant features of longitudi-
nal risk factor trajectories that are associated with CVD outcomes; 3) Leverage the work from Aims 1 and 2 to
facilitate the dissemination and use of the synthetic LRPP data by the research community."

The Training Program in Translational Research offers an interdisciplinary program of study and research that
prepares graduate students for successful careers at the interface between basic biomedical science and clinical
medicine. This program is designed for predoctoral Ph.D. students and aims to address the widely-recognized
shortage of rigorously trained scientists who can successfully work together with medical professionals to bridge
the gap between basic science and clinical practice. Annual support for 6 trainees (3 in their 2nd year and 3 in 3rd
year of graduate studies) is requested throughout five years of funding. The program is centered in the University
of Michigan School of Medicine, with participating faculty members affiliated with ten departments (6 clinical and
4 basic science) providing multidisciplinary training for graduate students in 15 degree-granting programs.
Additional faculty mentors have their primary appointments in the College of Pharmacy, the School of Dentistry
and the College of LSA. These faculty members were selected because of their commitment to graduate
education and expertise in translational research. Based on the long-standing research interests of these
preceptors, scientific projects will be focused on areas of excellence in cancer biology, epigenetics, aging,
immunology, neuroscience, omics studies, precision medicine and experimental therapeutics & biomarkers. This
broad spectrum of research activities provides a wide-range of exciting opportunities for students to work on
translational research projects. The educational experience will be enhanced and supported by integration of
dual-mentors with corresponding expertise in the basic and clinical aspects of the research project. The
curriculum includes innovative, individualized and competency-based coursework in translational science,
training in the performance of rigorous and reproducible research, and participation in clinical rotations,
interdisciplinary conferences, tumor boards, and grand rounds. These activities will be complemented by a T32-
based seminar series, workshops, annual retreat, and career development support. Our goal is to foster the
training of basic researchers who will interact with clinicians and laboratory professionals to become future
leaders in translating research findings into clinical practice to improve patient outcomes. The program will be
administered by co-directors who are experienced in, and passionate about, graduate student education and
translational research. The program will benefit from the advice and oversight of internal and external advisory
committees, both of which will assist the co-directors in running and evaluating the program. Graduates from this
program will have the skills and knowledge to undertake independent careers that feature translational and
multidisciplinary research. In summary, the strengths of this training program are the direct link between the
basic and clinical sciences, the collegial and successful preceptors, the experienced program leadership, and
the rich academic research and clinical environment at the University of Michigan."
10873005,"Project Summary/Abstract
At least 30% of Afghanistan and Iraq veterans are affected by Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and 20% are
affected by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other stress-related mood disorders. Currently existing
pharmacological treatments elicit temporary remission in <50% of patients; thus, there is an urgent need for
novel therapeutic approaches to target MDD and psychological stress-related mood disorders. The prevalence
of MDD is two- to threefold higher in patients with cardiovascular disease and MDD is associated with 80%
increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Clinical studies report higher levels of circulating pro-
inflammatory cytokines in patients with MDD and has been replicated in preclinical animal studies of
depression. Individual differences in the modulation of cytokine release (most notably IL-6) are associated with
susceptibility vs. resilience to chronic social stress in mice. Chronic inflammation and increases in circulatory
pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with stress-induced depression is linked with atherosclerotic plaque
formation, progression, and rupture, likely contributing to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Indeed,
immune modulatory approaches to neutralize inflammatory cytokines in the periphery produce antidepressant-
like behavioral effects following Chronic Social Defeat Stress (CSDS) in mice as well as in humans with
depression and chronic inflammation. The concept of resilience, the ability to maintain normal psychological
and physical functioning to avoid serious mental illness has topic of significant interest in Veterans during and
post-deployment after exposure to psychological stress.Recently, CSDS-associated depression has been
linked to impairment of the blood brain barrier (BBB), a series of protective layers including endothelial cells
and astrocytes that plays a critical role in maintaining vascular impermeability between the periphery and brain
parenchyma. The proposed validation studies implicate that impairment of the BBB may be causally
associated with stress-induced mood disorders. In particular, we will validate and expand our understanding
how stress influences the region-dependent impairment of the BBB in stress-induced mood disorders, as
previously reported by our collaborators Scott Russo, Anne Schaefer, and Miriam Merad in their publication
“Social stress induces neurovascular pathology promoting depression”. Using a well-characterized CSDS
model of psychological stress in mice that recapitulates many of the symptoms of MDD including social
withdrawal, anhedonia, and anxiety, we will explore through novel technological approaches how chronic
psychological stress impairs the BBB. In particular, we will utilize a novel endothelial-specific Translating
Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) mouse to explore stress-induced transcriptional patterns in multiple
mood-related brain regions to determine transcriptomic patterns to psychological stress. To further explore how
psychological stress impairs the BBB, we will utilize an innovative mass cytometry (CyTOF) to determine the
immune cell profiles in the periphery and brain tissue of susceptible vs. resilient mice and understand how
psychological stress mobilizes the innate immune system and causes infiltration of cytokines into the brain.
In summary, the proposal in this Merit Review Award for Validation Studies is of importance to Veteran Health.
This VA Merit Review Award is to validate recent findings by our collaborators showing that psychological
stress in a model of depression impairs BBB permeability and expand our knowledge into how stress induces
region-specific endothelial gene expression changes, leading to vascular damage and depression-linked
chronic inflammation. The findings of our studies will provide evidence for preclinical studies for novel
therapeutic approaches for treating stress-related MDD for Veterans."
10871800,"Menopause is a normal occurrence in all women and a gradual process that begins in the 5th decade of
life. Menopause is characterized by the loss of ovarian hormones that ultimately leads to a number of
comorbidities including weight gain, redistribution of fat from hips, waist and buttocks to the abdomen, and
decreased metabolic activity. Female US military veterans are the fastest growing patient population in the
Veterans Administration Health Care system, and more than a third of those patients are pre-, post- or
currently menopausal. However, the mechanisms by which menopausal changes in ovarian hormone
production regulate body fat content and metabolism is an unexplored area in VA research.
 We have discovered a subpopulation of adipocytes in adipose depots of mice and humans generated
from hematopoietic stem cells, termed bone marrow-derived adipocytes (BMDA). These cells are produced in
numbers sufficient to influence adipose tissue function, and their production is increased by loss of gonadal
sex hormones in mouse models that mimic menopause in women. These observations were noteworthy
because BMDAs differ from conventional adipocytes and possess a potentially detrimental phenotype,
characterized by elevated production of inflammatory cytokines.
 Recent preliminary data demonstrates that BMDA are produced from adipose tissue stromal cells that
express both myeloid and mesenchymal marker that we have termed “myeloid adipocyte progenitors” or
MAPs. Since evidence supporting the proliferation of mature adipocytes remains controversial, the ability of
gonadal hormones to regulate BMDA abundance can be attributed to the production and/or proliferation of
MAPs. This project will test the hypothesis that estrogen and follicle stimulating hormone differentially
regulate the production of MAPs (and BMDAs), altering the cellular composition of adipose and
resulting in significant changes in metabolic and inflammatory phenotype. Three Specific Aims will test
this hypothesis by determining whether 1) ablation of ovarian hormone receptors, or 2) direct depletion of
ovarian hormones regulates BMDA abundance. A third aim will measure changes in body composition and
metabolic parameters in mice with depletion of MAPs and ovarian hormones.
 Successful completion of these studies has the potential to establish the crucial contribution of MAPs to
adipose tissue heterogeneity and changes to adipose tissue function with loss of ovarian hormone production.
A better understanding of this phenomenon will highlight opportunities to control the cellular composition and
function of adipose tissue as a novel strategy to combat menopausal comorbidities."
10881703,"Development of new and improved strategies for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) treatment is urgently
needed since molecular complexity of TNBC together with therapy-associated side effects and emergence of
drug-resistance often limit effectiveness of current therapies. CARP-1/CCAR1 is a ubiquitous, phospho-protein
that can induce proliferation and apoptosis through multiple mechanisms. CARP-1 transduces chemotherapy
(adriamycin, etoposide, or Iressa)-dependent inhibitory signaling, and co-activates Adriamycin (ADR)-induced
p53. CARP-1 also co-activates cell-cycle regulatory anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) E3 ubiquitin ligase
and steroid/thyroid receptors. Here we report that CARP-1 interacts with ERKs, and binds with NEMO (NF-B
Essential Modulator; NF-B-activating kinase IKK subunit ). Our preliminary and published studies revealed
that ADR induced CARP-1 threonine627 phosphorylation, ERK activation, and canonical NF-B pathway that
involved NEMO-CARP-1 binding. Importantly, inhibition of NEMO-CARP-1 binding diminishes NF-B activation
(noted by phosphorylation of p65/RelA) by ADR but not by TNFα, interleukin (IL)2, or EGF. Further, SNI-1, a
novel SMI of NEMO-CARP-1 binding, enhances ADR or Cisplatin inhibition of TNBC cells, diminishes levels of
genotoxic stress (ADR or Cisplatin)-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL8. SNI-1 enhances TNBC
growth suppression by ADR or Cisplatin in vivo in 4T1 syngeneic tumor model.
Hypothesis: DNA Damage-inducing drugs (ADR, Cisplatin) activate CARP-1-mediated canonical NF-B and
ERK pathways. The rationale for this hypothesis include our preliminary and published studies that indicate
inhibition of therapy-induced, canonical NF-B activation by disruption of NEMO-CARP-1 binding enhances
efficacy of ADR and Cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ADR also induces CARP-1 phosphorylation and,
since genotoxic therapy also activates ERKs, targeting of NEMO-CARP-1 binding together with ERK inhibitors
will result in greater tumor suppression by ADR or Cisplatin. Thus, targeting of CARP-1/NEMO binding could
permit us to overcome chemo-resistance in TNBCs without affecting other central functions of NF-B induced
by TNFα, IL2, and/or EGF signaling necessary for host tissue homeostasis. We will conduct following three
aims to test our hypothesis.
Aim 1: To define role of CARP-1 in genotoxic chemotherapy-induced canonical NF-B survival pathway. SNI-1
inhibits therapy-induced NEMO phosphorylation. We will elucidate how SNI-1 inhibits DNA damage-induced,
NEMO phosphorylation and canonical NF-B pathway.
Aim 2: To investigate mechanism(s) by which CARP-1 interacts with ERKs. We will determine how targeting of
ERKs in combination with SNI-1 enhances efficacy of genotoxic chemotherapy.
Aim 3: To demonstrate targeting of CARP-1/NEMO-dependent canonical, NF-B signaling by water-soluble
SNI-1 alone or coupled with targeting of ERKs by therapeutics currently in clinical trials/use, will result in
superior TNBC tumor kill by genotoxic chemotherapy in vivo.
Potential Impact on Veterans Health Care: The proposed studies will yield valuable knowledge of molecular
mechanisms of action of genotoxic chemotherapies (ADR and Cisplatin) to permit effective treatment of
TNBCs and their drug-resistant counterparts. Our discovery of SNI-1 and its potential to enhance efficacy of
TNBC therapies to overcome therapy-induced resistance will have translational impact and are expected to
facilitate development of novel and effective strategies to combat hard to treat breast cancers that will benefit
female VA workforce, contribute to Veterans Health Care and further the VA mission."
10782506,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aberrant changes in mature neural connections and their function can be induced by infection and inflammation
within the brain. The intracellular protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, is one pathogen that infects the brain,
evokes a prolonged inflammatory response and can cause seizures. Persistent infection by this parasite is also
associated with behavioral alterations and is a considerable risk factor for developing psychiatric illness, includ-
ing schizophrenia. Over 30% of Americans are presently living with an incurable long-term infection of Toxo-
plasma gondii, yet, despite its prevalence and implications for serious neurological disorders, we lack sufficient
understanding of the effect of life-long parasitic infection on the brain – a major organ of the human body in which
the parasite invades cells. This study seeks to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of brain circuitry dysregu-
lation in long-term infection in response to this unmet need. Our recent studies have revealed that Toxoplasma
gondii brain infection causes changes in inhibitory circuitry (specifically the loss of inhibitory synapses) along
with changes in inhibitory neurotransmission, leading to the onset of seizures. Moreover, preliminary studies
demonstrating increased expression of classical complement cascade components, elevated microglial activa-
tion, and substantial microglial ensheathment of neurons and inhibitory nerve terminals, propose dynamic inter-
active roles for the innate immune system and resident-macrophages of the brain in altering functionally mature
neural circuits during parasitic infection. In this proposal, we test the hypotheses that molecular components of
the innate complement pathway mediate inhibitory synapse loss and seizures, and that microglia remove and
phagocytose these synapses following chronic Toxoplasma gondii infection. By capitalizing on multi-scale imag-
ing modalities, the aims in this proposal will deliver novel ultrastructural and real-time insight into the impact of
chronic parasitic infection on mature neural circuits and will offer a novel mechanism as to how persistent Toxo-
plasma gondii infection may contribute to both seizures and psychiatric illness. This study is directly aligned with
the NIH's Blueprint Program's mission to expand our understanding of the neuroimmune dynamic interactions
that give way to neurological disorders."

Despite freely available HIV services and antiretroviral therapy (ART), people newly diagnosed with HIV in
refugee settlements in Uganda have suboptimal rates of ART initiation, adherence, and viral suppression.
Refugees face unique barriers to HIV care engagement including long distances to clinic with environmental
conditions impacting travel, prohibitive transportation costs with severely limited livelihood opportunities to offset
them, disrupted social networks, and guarded HIV status disclosure due to fear of anticipated stigma and reliance
on other community members to meet basic survival needs. Innovative strategies to improve engagement in HIV
care for this priority population are urgently needed. Community ART delivery, a differentiated ART delivery
strategy offered in Uganda for stable clients, reduces time and transportation barriers, fosters social support,
and improves engagement in HIV care. Individuals newly diagnosed with HIV, however, are currently excluded
from participation in community ART delivery and the impact of this ART delivery strategy has not been evaluated
for this group. This is a critical gap in HIV research as the time following initial HIV diagnosis is a vulnerable
period with high rates of attrition from care. Preliminary findings from a pilot study in Nakivale Refugee Settlement
in southwestern Uganda found that early community ART delivery, implemented at the time of HIV diagnosis,
may enhance viral suppression in this setting. The overall objective of this proposal is to conduct a cluster
randomized controlled trial to discern the effectiveness of “Head StART,” community ART delivery for those
newly diagnosed with HIV, compared to standard care (facility-based ART delivery) to achieve HIV viral
suppression. The central hypothesis is that Head StART will be an effective and affordable intervention at refugee
health centers across Uganda. Guided by promising preliminary data and supported by the social ecological
model, this hypothesis will be tested with these specific aims: 1) To evaluate the effectiveness of Head StART
in achieving HIV viral suppression for people newly diagnosed with HIV in refugee settlements in Uganda; 2) To
assess Head StART implementation across refugee settlement locations to understand the impact of contextual
factors on achieving optimal HIV clinical outcomes; and 3) To estimate the programmatic cost and budget impact
of implementing Head StART in refugee settlements in Uganda. The approach is innovative, in that it assesses
novel timing of community ART delivery in a humanitarian crisis affected population at high risk of poor clinical
outcomes. This proposal is responsive to the NIH priorities for HIV-related research in that it includes assessment
of HIV viral suppression among refugees and Ugandan nationals newly diagnosed with HIV, as well as evaluation
of an intervention to advance ART delivery. The long-term goal is to devise strategies to optimize HIV outcomes
in refugee settlements in Uganda. The proposed research is significant, because it could improve HIV viral
suppression in humanitarian contexts globally, advancing progress towards the 95-95-95 UNAIDS targets."
10834076,"Project Summary
Cytochromes c are highly conserved heme proteins that function in electron transport chains for cellular
functions such as respiration, photosynthesis and detoxification. The ability of prokaryotes to survive and thrive
in diverse, often hostile environments is a direct result of the plasticity of their electron transport chains, of
which cytochrome c is an essential component. Much effort has been devoted to studying the roles of
individual cytochromes c, but much less is understood about their biogenesis, which requires the covalent
attachment of heme at a conserved CXXCH motif for proper folding and function. Despite their diversity, all
cytochromes c are made by one of three pathways, System I (prokaryotes), System II (prokaryotes) and
System III (eukaryotes), thus elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of these pathways is critical to our
understanding of bioenergetics and cellular survival. While the three pathways have evolved different
mechanisms to accomplish biogenesis, all must transport heme to a holocytochrome c synthetase. Heme is an
essential co-factor in all organisms, functioning not only in electron transport chains for respiration, but also for
catalysis, regulation and signaling. Yet our knowledge of heme transporters and heme trafficking is limited due
to heme’s cytotoxicity, the transient nature of trafficking and the technical challenges of studying membrane
proteins. Thus, we must also address the mechanisms of heme trafficking and here we describe our long-term
vision to elucidate the general mechanisms of heme delivery, transport and attachment, beginning with the
System I pathway. We propose to 1) identify the cytoplasmic heme receptor and mechanisms of heme
delivery, 2) determine the path of heme trafficking by System I, and 3) identify the requirements for periplasmic
heme attachment. The System I pathway consists of eight integral membrane proteins (CcmABCDEFGH) and
provides a tractable model system to study these fundamental biological questions. CcmABCD are proposed
to transport heme across the bacterial membrane and attach it to CcmE, the periplasmic heme chaperone,
which trafficks heme to the holocytochrome c synthetase, CcmFH. Utilizing a functional, recombinant E. coli
system, the System I proteins purify with endogenous heme, removing many of the technical barriers often
associated with membrane proteins. Importantly, the heme attachment reaction occurs in the periplasm, is
required for the survival of many pathogens, and likely differs in mechanisms of heme attachment from the
eukaryotic synthetase, thus the CcmFH synthetase is a potential target for novel antimicrobials. Our proposed
studies on System I will simultaneously provide insights into cytochrome c biogenesis and general
mechanisms of heme trafficking, uniquely positioning us to study two fundamental biological processes. A
natural extension of this work is to apply the general principles learned and approaches developed to the other
cytochrome c biogenesis pathways, as well as to other prokaryotic and eukaryotic heme transporters."

For cells to properly adapt to changing environmental conditions around them, they must rely on sensory
proteins which both detect these changes and initiate proper responses. As one solution to this challenge,
nature has evolved classes of ligand-regulated protein/protein interaction domains, harnessing these to control
numerous types of protein function. Understanding how these domains undertake the requisite sensing and
signaling events has given insight into fundamental aspects of biology, enabled the development of new tools
for biomedical research, and inspired novel therapies to disease. Here we focus on examining the signaling
mechanisms used by proteins containing PAS (Period-ARNT-Singleminded) domains, found in tens of
thousands of proteins where they control the activity of over 20 enzymatic and non-enzymatic effector
domains. These processes are regulated by different stimuli in different members of the family, harnessing
changes in the occupancy or configuration of bound cofactors to “switch” activity on and off. Some aspects of
these triggers are well understood in some PAS domains, such as in the subset known as LOV (Light-Oxygen-
Voltage) photosensory domains, where blue light illumination drives the specific photochemical formation of
protein/flavin adducts which allosterically controls protein conformation around the chromophore. However,
fundamental questions regarding these signaling processes remain unanswered, limiting our understanding of
how environmental changes are sensed and how these might be artificially controlled. We propose to answer
these limitations by pursuing three aims: 1). Determine activation-associated structural changes of several
classes of bacterial LOV and PAS proteins; 2). Examine the generality of LOV signaling within a novel class of
fungal RGS-LOV proteins; 3). Examine PAS regulation of serine/threonine kinase activity in the nutrient-
sensing human PAS kinase. To achieve these ends, we will take advantage of a broad foundation of
preliminary structural and functional data that will be extended with a mix of biophysical and biochemical
studies. Outcomes from this research will include information about fundamental regulatory processes
employed by these proteins, giving insights into both basic aspects of biomedicine along with potential
therapeutic and biotechnology applications."

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically extended the lives of people living with HIV (PLWH); however,
they continue to experience a plethora of co-morbid conditions including neuronal disorders and pain.
Between 40 and 72% of PLWH use cannabis to mitigate anxiety, stress, ART side effects, pain, and/or for
pleasure with over 55% of patients using cannabis at least daily. Interestingly, a recent study found that people
who use cannabis heavily had reduced inflammatory signatures in PLWH on ART. These and a numerous
other studies support the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulator effects of phytocannabinoids in a number of
organ systems including heart, colon, kidney, liver and the gut; however, their medicinal use is confounded by
the psychotropic activities. Efforts to separate the anti-inflammatory effects from the psychotropic effects have
revealed differential activities of 3 endogenous receptors including cannabis receptor 1 (CB2) CB2 which
exhibit differential tissue expression and agonism with endo- and phyto-cannabinoids. Several reports have
shown that cannabinoids attenuate HIV infection and/or replication in T-cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and
human fetal microglia cultured ex vivo. However, the effect of cannabinoids on HIV infection of microglia in the
context of ART and the normal cellular environment of neighboring neurons and astrocytes in the CNS has not
been examined. Several studies specifically implicate CB2 agonism which has been shown to have anti-
inflammatory properties in the heart, gut, experimental autoimmune encephalitis and neuropathic pain via
inflammasome activation. This has led us to hypothesize that Cannabinoid signaling influences HIV infection
and chronic inflammation in the presence of ARV in the central nervous system by attenuating the
inflammasome.
 In order to examine HIV infection in the context of cells of the CNS, we have developed a human
induced pluripotent stem cell tri-culture model composed of iNeurons, iAstrocytes, and iMicroglia. This model
recapitulates several key aspects of HIV infection in the CNS including increased cytokine production,
oxidative stress response, inflammatory signaling, and integrated stress response. ARV treatment reduces
HIV infection and inflammatory signaling pathways; however, a subset of pathways remain elevated despite
viral suppression. We propose to further develop this model to determine the ability of cannabinoids to
modulate HIV-induced inflammation and subsequent neuronal dysfunction via reducing inflammasome
activation by: 1) Determining the effect of cannabinoids on chronic HIV infection and ART in the context of
iMgl/iNrn/iAstr triculture. 2) Determining the effect of cannabinoids on cytokine levels, inflammatory gene
expression profile, and microglial activation in iMgl/iNrn/iAstr triculture. 3) Determining the effect of
cannabinoids on neurons and astrocytes in HIV infection and ART in iMgl/iNrn/iAstr triculture."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, affecting 55 million worldwide, and is typified
by extracellular deposits of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles. Numerous clinical
trials designed to alleviate cognitive symptoms by targeting Aβ pathology have failed. However, few studies have
comprehensively examined the earlier, prodromal stages, which are characterized by anxiety, agitation,
depression, and sleep-wake disturbances that significantly disrupt quality of life and ability to remain
independent. The noradrenergic nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) modulates these physiological processes and is
the first region to accumulate hyperphosphorylated ‘pretangle’ tau decades before cognitive deficits and Aβ
plaques appear. It is therefore important to establish whether a causal relationship between LC tau pathology
and prodromal symptoms exists because it can lead to development of therapeutic interventions that relieve
these devastating non-cognitive symptoms and possibly halt disease progression. While catastrophic LC cell
body degeneration occurs in late AD, the earlier prodromal phases are characterized by aberrant tau
accumulation and reductions in LC innervations to projection regions. Moreover, there are suggestions that
surviving LC neurons show compensatory increases in firing accompanied by elevations in forebrain adrenergic
receptors, thus promoting noradrenergic hyperactivity that could underlie the prodromal symptoms. Since most
animal models fail to recapitulate the pathological prodromal feature of hyperphosphorylated tau in the LC, I will
develop a biologically valid mouse model where aberrant forms of tau are exclusively expressed in the LC using
viral vector-mediated strategies. In Aim 1, I will determine if LC tau burden disrupts LC-sensitive behaviors
relevant to prodromal symptoms and exacerbates neuropathology. In Aim 2, I will interrogate the genetic
mechanisms that underlie tau-mediated LC dysregulation and degeneration by using Translating Ribosome
Affinity Purification (TRAP) to selectively isolate the LC transcriptome and RNAscope in situ hybridization to
assess downstream effects on adrenergic receptor gene expression in LC-projecting regions. I hypothesize that
aberrant tau in the LC will cause behavioral abnormalities that are commonly associated with the prodromal
phase of AD and disrupt normal noradrenergic transmission. Successful completion of these aims will reveal
putative molecular mechanistic factors that underlie prodromal symptoms commonly experienced by AD patients
and can yield disease-modifying targets for therapeutic interventions."

10794352,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Indiana Pediatric Scientist Award (IPSA)
A critical need exists for training the next generation of physician scientists with formal education and training
in child health. Challenges remain in an overall shrinking pipeline of junior faculty and in broadening the racial
and gender diversity of the workforce. Without highly trained investigators, who can stretch the limits of current
scientific knowledge, the goal of cutting-edge research that will transform child and adolescent health cannot
be realized. The Indiana University Department of Pediatrics is uniquely positioned to address this need. A
strong, well-established group of basic science investigators in a Departmental Institute have the advantage of
being located directly adjacent to Riley Hospital for Children, the only comprehensive children's hospital in the
state of Indiana. The Department of Pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) is consistently
ranked in the top 10 in NIH funding and its NIH portfolio has more than doubled in the past 8 years. Pediatric
researchers at IUSM have established international reputations in the fields of infectious disease, diabetes,
Rasopathies and other genetic diseases with an increasing signature of bench to bedside science including
repurposing or generating targeted therapeutics. The IUSM and the Riley Children's Foundation have
provided extensive resources necessary for the recruitment of distinguished research faculty and the
professional development of trainees. This support has allowed a strategic and systematic increase in our
entire pipeline development, including a striking increase in K funded junior faculty. Working within this existing
strong institutional foundation, we seek support to further expand the development of an internal and externally
recruited group of broadly diverse pediatric researchers at IUSM. The main objective of the Indiana University
School of Medicine's Indiana Pediatric Scientist Award (IPSA) training program is to provide investigators
committed to pursuing careers as academic pediatric physician scientists with a rigorous and individualized
mentored research experience that elevates each trainee for competitive individual mentored career awards.
The current program is designed specifically for pediatric physician scientists and provides an established
blueprint for success, including structured mentorship, guidance, and progressive goals in order to achieve
independent funding. Consequently, the IPSA program will provide a customized, multi-disciplinary mentorship
with attention to individual learning styles, backgrounds, and interests. Support will allow the IUSM
Department of Pediatrics to continue to expand a rapidly growing, multifaceted program and recruit a talented,
diverse cohort of pediatric physician-scientist trainees to carry out basic and translational research that will
ultimately inform disease pathogenesis and transform health care for children."
10806970,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorders in the United States, with
cognitive decline being among its most debilitating non-motor symptoms. With disease progression, most
individuals eventually develop dementia. However, the trajectory of cognitive decline varies between
individuals—leading to a search for risk factors of impending decline. In 2019, Ryan and colleagues proposed a
precision aging model and suggested that typical age-related cognitive decline was influenced by three broad
categories of “brain drivers”: neuropathology (e.g., alpha-synuclein, tau), neuroinflammation (e.g., cytokines),
and cerebrovascular dysfunction (e.g., white matter hyperintensities). Past research has consistently measured
these brain driver factors in isolation, despite these factors all belonging to an interconnected, neurobiological
system. Thus, the goal of the proposed study is to determine whether cognitive variation in PD is better explained
by a combination of these neurobiological risk factors, relative to isolated factors. The central hypothesis is that
each category of brain drivers (i.e., neuropathology, neuroinflammation, cerebrovascular dysfunction) will
uniquely relate to cognitive performance (specifically executive function and memory), such that adding in each
category will better explain changes in each cognitive domain. The proposed study will examine data from an
existing, well-characterized cohort of individuals with idiopathic PD without dementia (N=112) to determine the
association between brain driver factors and cognitive performance cross-sectionally and longitudinally (at a 2-
year follow-up). To do so, brain driver relationships with cognition will be assessed in isolation (using correlations)
and in combination (using hierarchical linear regressions, adding in factors from each brain driver category
sequentially). Overall, this method shifts the focus towards a precision medicine approach—whereby examining
multiple brain drivers may allow for greater understanding of individualized risk of cognitive decline in individuals
with PD. Improving the assessment of cognitive risk could inform both clinical prognosis for patients with PD and
allow for a more targeted selection of participants into experimental trials aiming to slow impending cognitive
decline. The proposed training plan will provide the applicant with additional training experiences beyond that of
her Ph.D. program. Specific training goals include (1) gaining expertise in the methodologies measuring
neuroinflammatory and neuropathology biomarkers and their interpretation, (2) gaining proficiency with structural
magnetic resonance imaging (acquisition, processing, and interpretation) to measure white matter
hyperintensities (a metric of cerebrovascular dysfunction), (3) advancing statistical competencies and
experimental rigor, and (4) professional and career skills development. The proposed project and training goals
will be completed with the resources and support of a strong research environment, including a productive
mentoring team with specific expertise in the proposed area of study. Taken together, the proposed research
and other activities will help prepare the applicant as she transitions into a career as an independent investigator."
11051314,"Although by 2060 African Americans, Hispanics, and residents of rural communities will constitute the
majority of US patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), these populations have long been neglected in AD
research studies and clinical trials. In this large scale fast-track SBIR application, we propose to gather
normative longitudinal California Cognitive Assessment Battery (CCAB) data from 300 healthy older (ages 60
to 89) individuals in each of four underserved populations: (1) African Americans: (2) English-speaking US
Hispanics; (2) Spanish-speaking US Hispanics; and (4) non-Hispanic white (nHW) residents of rural
communities. Participants will be recruited in California and South Texas. We will compare the results from
each group with existing normative data from a primarily suburban white population.
 The CCAB includes 34 innovative computerized cognitive tests and questionnaires that utilize cellphone
networks to enable telemedical testing in patients’ homes. CCAB test introductions and test materials are
delivered with AI-enhanced text-to-speech voices and verbal responses are analyzed with consensus
automatic speech recognition (CASR) with unexcelled transcription accuracy. Recruitment is facilitated and
testing throughput is increased because CCAB tests are administered in participants’ homes. The CCAB has
been designed to facilitate translation into other languages. Here, we will test Spanish-speaking US residents
with CCAB-Español, a Spanish version of the CCAB optimized for US Spanish dialects.
 During Phase I, we will recruit African American and Hispanic examiners, assure that the Spanish
translation of the CCAB is adapted for the US Hispanic population, and begin testing. During Phase II we will
continue enrollment testing and thereafter test participants at one-year intervals to gather longitudinal norms
and identify performance patterns that predict subsequent cognitive decline. Ethnoracial norms for each CCAB
test will be developed using traditional analysis and supplemented with Item response theory factor analysis to
improve scoring sensitivity and eliminate score bias. The acquisition of normative CCAB data will lower access
barriers to neuropsychological assessment among ethnoracial minorities for six reasons: (1) At-home CCAB
Testing will not be interrupted by COVID-19 lockdowns; (2) At-home CCAB testing minimizes mobility and
transportation challenges; (3) CCAB-Español will address the lack of well-normed, scalable Spanish-language
tests for the US Hispanic population and facilitate access to Spanish-speaking examiners; (4) CCAB
telemedical testing will provide access to cognitive assessments in neglected urban and rural neighborhoods;
(5) CCAB testing can reduce cost barriers to cognitive assessment by more than 70%; (6) The CCAB will
reduce cultural barriers to research participation by testing participants in their familiar home surroundings and
by using ethnoracially sensitive African American and Hispanic examiners."
10764306,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
For many patients suffering from psychiatric illness, the primary source of daily-life distress is inner
experiences that often seem to occur ‘on their own’ (self-generated experiences). These uncontrollable
experiences can take various forms, including rumination, worry, hallucination or delusional thinking. Given the
severe global burden of mental illness, and the high prevalence of patients who are resistant to current
treatments, there is a pressing need to develop new therapies designed to directly target the brain’s systems
that produce maladaptive self-generated experiences. As a precursor to therapy development, significant
progress must be made in our fundamental understanding of how the brain gives rise to self-generated
experiences. To address this need, we will develop a new approach called “real-time functional MRI (fMRI)-
triggered experience-sampling” to efficiently sample spontaneous neural events (of a predefined type) and to
map those events to specific qualities of self-generated experiences. Within 32 healthy adults, we will use
online (real-time) fMRI analysis to detect brain activations and trigger the appearance of visual rating scales so
that participants can report their experiences immediately after the occurrence of a neural event of interest.
This approach aims to maximize how informative the data are on each trial and to offer rigorous investigation
of the psychological significance of specific neural events. We will develop and validate our approach with a
focus on real-time fMRI analysis of the dorsal anterior insular cortex (daIC), a brain region implicated in
salience detection that is consistently identified as having aberrant structure, function, and connectivity in
psychiatric illness at a transdiagnostic level. Our Aim 1 is to determine whether spontaneous daIC activation
events are time-locked to instances of salient, high-arousal self-generated experience. We will sample self-
generated experiences both during instances of daIC activation and during baseline (intermediate daIC
activity) events. We hypothesize that daIC activation, relative to baseline events, will be time-locked to self-
generated experiences with higher subjective ratings of arousal and vividness (regardless of affective valence).
We will further test whether relationships between the daIC and self-generated experiences are mediated by
autonomic arousal, as assessed based on pupil dilation and activation within the locus coeruleus (a subcortical
generator of arousal-related neuromodulation). Our Aim 2 is to determine whether specific qualities of self-
generated experience depend on coupling between the daIC and whole-brain activity. We will examine
whether different instances of daIC activation co-occur with multiple, distinct whole-brain co-activation patterns.
We will further test whether distinct daIC co-activation patterns are associated with fluctuations in affect
(positive vs. negative experiences). If successful, our protocols can later be applied in patients with psychiatric
illness and to potentially guide the development of interventions (e.g., neurostimulation) that aim to target the
neural processes that produce self-generated experiences that are core to mental illness."
10828379,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that in almost all cases
has one of two underlying proteinopathies – FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. To date MRI-based measures have not
been able to reliably distinguish clinical syndromes or their underlying proteinopathies. A key feature of FTLD
is the localized pattern of degeneration associated with various disease subtypes. These spatial patterns have
been associated with clinical syndromes, as well as the underlying proteinopathies that are most-relevant for
treatment studies. However, to date these patterns alone are not sufficiently specific to fully predict syndromes
or separate FTLD-tau from FTLD-TDP in a single patient. We have recently shown that, in addition to atrophy,
FTLD is associated with iron-rich cortical pathology. Moreover, our findings indicate that the specific cortical
layers impacted by this pathology are distinct in FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP, offering a potential target for the
development of imaging biomarkers.
We propose to use iron-sensitive MRI as the basis for the development of novel imaging biomarkers, with the
aim of both monitoring disease progression and diagnosing underlying pathologic subtypes, addressing a
highest priority recommendation of the 2019 ADRD Summit. We propose a two-pronged approach to this goal:
First, we will use joint ex vivo MRI and histopathology in 50 human hemispheres, donated by patients with
FTLD and typical age-matched controls, to quantify the distributions of iron-rich pathology. In particular, we will
quantify both the laminar distribution and its relation to the patients’ underlying proteinopathies. In addition, we
will evaluate the distribution of disease across the cortex, and associate this with clinical information collected
during the patients’ lifetimes, including clinical syndrome and more fine-grained measures of symptoms.
Second, we will use in vivo MRI at 3T and 7T with 100 FTLD patients an typical volunteers to develop and
validate imaging protocols sensitive to the pathologic iron. At 3T, we will focus on quantifying the distribution of
iron across the cortex. We will correlate these cortical findings with MRI-based measures of atrophy, and
clinical measures including both symptoms and blood and CSF-based measures of degeneration and
pathology. At 7T, we will develop and validate focal laminar imaging methods, with the aim of recapitulating our
ex vivo findings in living patients and age-matched controls.
The overall goal of this study is to develop and validate novel, iron-sensitive imaging biomarkers for FTLD to
both monitor and diagnose underlying syndromes and pathologies. The ability to disciminate underlying
proteinopathies is a key need in treatment trials which focus on either FTLD-tau or FTLD-TDP. Moreover,
measuring the quantity and distribution of iron in the brain will also be valuable for monitoring disease
progression, both in treatment trials, and more generally for FTLD patients in clinical care."

Pulmonary fibrosis is a class of disease conditions characterized by subacute and chronic progressive scarring
of the lungs. The most common form, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), has a prevalence of 1 in 200 among
people older than 65. IPF is a devastating disease with a median survival of 3 to 5 years with limited therapy to
halt its progression. Recent research had highlighted the critical role of macrophages, particularly monocyte-
derived macrophages (MDMs), in pulmonary fibrosis. Macrophages are highly plastic and undergo metabolic
reprogramming and alternative activation during fibrosis. The interactions of macrophages and their fibrotic
environment are crucial for fibrosis progression. Numerous studies have shown that different biochemical
signals can induce macrophage metabolic reprogramming and alternative activation; however, limited data are
available to demonstrate whether physical signals such as enhanced extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness, the
cardinal changes during lung fibrosis, can modulate macrophage metabolic reprogramming and alternative
activation. Our preliminary data showed that macrophages cultured on matrix with stiffness similar to fibrotic
lungs (20 kPa) had increased PPARγ compared to macrophages cultured on a soft and compliant matrix with
stiffness similar to normal health lungs (0.5 kPa). Integrin β3 is increased in lung macrophages from human
subjects with pulmonary fibrosis and animal with experimental fibrosis. Mechanistically, we hypothesize that
macrophages utilize integrin β3 as the mechanosensor to activate PPARγ to modulate metabolic
reprogramming and alternative activation. In Aim 1, we will determine if ECM-stiffness regulates macrophage
metabolic reprogramming. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanosignaling pathway utilized by macrophages
to modulate metabolic reprogramming. In Aim 3, we will test our hypothesis in an experimental pulmonary
fibrosis mice model to determine whether interrupting PPARγ-mediated mechanosignaling and metabolic
reprogramming in macrophages can attenuate pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. By completing this proposed study,
we aim to show that 1) macrophages sense ECM stiffness via Integrin αvβ3; 2) matrix stiffness can modulate
macrophage metabolism to sustain its alternative activation; 3) PPARγ is a mechanosensitive transcription
factor, and 4) inhibiting αvβ3-PPARγ mechanotransduction pathway in macrophages can attenuate pulmonary
fibrosis in vivo. I will utilize this proposal to acquire additional skills in the cutting-edge field of mechano-
immuno-metabolomics through a series of didactic and applied training under the mentorship of an
experienced multidisciplinary team. This K08 will facilitate my transition to an independent physician-scientist
studying the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, with a unique research niche of mechano-immuno-
metabolomics. This research proposal will also aid in identifying novel mechanisms and targets for therapies in
pulmonary fibrosis, which is fatal and with limited treatment."
10766250,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Approximately 10% of all newborns require delivery room (DR) resuscitation after birth to prevent death or
disability. Evidence-based neonatal resuscitation guidelines exist, but evidence-based practices (EBPs) and
guidelines are not used consistently. Thus, there is an important implementation gap for EBPs in DR
resuscitation that contributes to low quality care.
 Successful resuscitation and EBP implementation requires three factors: evidence (e.g., guidelines),
facilitation (e.g., educational efforts), and context (e.g., the local environment/organization). The American
Academy of Pediatrics Neonatal Resuscitation Program provides two of these factors by generating evidence-
based guidelines and disseminating an educational curriculum. However, little attention has been paid to the
third factor: local context. Organizational culture (the beliefs, perceptions, and values in an organization) is a
fundamental component of the local context and directly influences key resuscitation behavioral skills.
However, the role of organizational culture in the implementation of DR resuscitation EBPs remains
understudied. This represents a potential opportunity to improve the implementation context for delivery room
care, ultimately improving DR resuscitation processes and outcomes.
 Our objective is to adapt and validate a resuscitation-specific measure of organizational culture and pilot
test its association with DR EBP implementation outcomes. A critical gap is that no resuscitation-specific
measure of organizational culture exists. This proposal will 1) adapt and validate a resuscitation-specific
measure of organizational culture; and 2) examine associations between organizational culture and EBP
implementation, assessing both DR EBP penetration (defined as integration of a practice within the DR setting)
and staff-reported outcomes (e.g., perceived implementation success), providing further validation of the
resuscitation-specific measure of organizational culture. This cross-sectional study will integrate a network-
wide survey of 14 hospitals with an active, network-supported DR quality improvement project focused on
promoting DR EBPs for preterm infants.
 Validation of a resuscitation-specific measure of organizational culture is a critical step in understanding
the role of organizational culture in delivery room resuscitation. Examining components of organizational
culture and associations with EBP implementation has the potential to inform future efforts to improve
resuscitation across all types of hospitals where infants are born. This work also has implications beyond the
DR, as our adapted measure is not specific to DR resuscitation and could be applied to resuscitations in other
patient populations and healthcare settings."

 Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and causes more preventable
hospitalizations and lost school days than any other childhood disease. Children in lower-income, urban,
and racial/ethnic minority populations are more likely to have asthma, to have poorly controlled disease,
and to experience preventable morbidity. Multi-level interventions that address the complex array of
interrelated societal and environmental factors that contribute to these disparities are poorly supported
in traditional fee-for-service payment models. In contrast, accountable care organizations (ACOs) are
designed to support and sustain interventions that address social determinants of health as part of
medical care. A substantial and growing number children with asthma in higher-risk populations receive
care in ACOs, but their effect on asthma quality of care, outcomes and disparities is not known.
 This study will be the first to address this critical gap in knowledge by taking advantage of a natural
experiment taking place in Massachusetts (MA), a state with high rates of childhood asthma: In 2018,
MA, launched 17 new Medicaid ACOs with varied organizational features (e.g., size; age mix). We will
use detailed state-level claims data to: 1) determine the association between implementation of the
ACOs and changes in childhood asthma quality indicators, health outcome for Medicaid-insured children
and 2) assess changes in socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in these outcome measures
comparing children enrolled in Medicaid ACOs to matched commercially-insured children. We then turn
to understanding the influence of ACOs’ organizational features on change by: 3) using mixed-methods
to generate detailed characterizations of the ACOs’ organizational features and 4) test the association
between these features and childhood asthma quality indicators and outcomes. We will use innovative
methods of risk adjustment that take social risk factors into account and propensity matched difference-
in-difference analyses to account for factors other than ACO implementation that may affect outcomes.
 This study will take place at a moment when the profound inequities in health and healthcare in the
U.S. are starkly illuminated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in
childhood asthma persist despite the existence of evidence-based treatments resulting from decades of
work and billions of dollars directed at improving asthma care. Structural changes in healthcare are
needed for equitable delivery of evidence-based asthma care, which should reduce or even eliminate
these long standing disparities. The ACO model moves healthcare payment and delivery in a direction
that could facilitate this change. This study will address major gaps in knowledge as to whether the large
investments being made in developing the ACO model may pay off for the millions of children at
increased risk for long-term poor health due to preventable consequences of asthma."
10760293,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Clonal hematopoiesis is acquired with aging, and in some cases, precedes the onset of both myelodysplastic
and myeloproliferative disorders. However, the genetic drivers that underlie the evolution of clonal
hematopoiesis and the subsequent disease risk remain poorly understood. This proposal builds on generated
evidence showing that telomere length, a genetic and clinically available biomarker, predisposes to clonal
hematopoiesis in Mendelian syndromes. We have also found evidence for distinct clonal hematopoiesis
mutations that appear to differentially predispose to hypoplastic and myeloproliferative phenotypes. In this
application, we will examine the role of telomere length in driving clonal evolution with aging in well-
characterized cohorts including a Baltimore-based cohort of community-based women with a large African
American subset. Additionally, we will also examine the onset and prevalence of a novel clonal hematopoiesis
mutation in the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene that appears to be protective against myeloid
malignancies. This K08 grant application is supported by outstanding mentors and in a strong translational
environment at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine with a detailed mentorship and training plan that
focuses on genetic epidemiology and computational biology skills. The knowledge has the potential to impact
current paradigms related to hematopoietic aging, myeloid clonal disease risk as well as novel biomarkers of
specific disease risk and progression."
10748388,"While the underlying etiology of preeclampsia (a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy) is not
known, the disease starts with shallow placentation and placental ischemia which in turn releases
excess of anti-angiogenic proteins such as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFLT1) in the mother's
bloodstream that is responsible for the systemic maternal endothelial dysfunction. Self-renewing
three-dimensional epithelial organoids that closely resemble the structure and physiology of the
original organ have been successfully developed into various tissue types using human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). However, organoids of the human placental trophoblasts using
hiPSCs are yet to be generated. Our goal of this proposal is to generate trophoblast organoids
from disease-specific hiPSCs to study preeclampsia pathogenesis and to screen for drugs as
potential treatment targets. We will generate a new model of trophoblast organoid using hiPSCs,
replicating the early stage of gestation from normal and preeclamptic pregnancies, a time in
development that has – until now – has been mostly inaccessible to researchers. In aim 1, we will
optimize trophoblast organoid protocols in our laboratory using hiPSCs derived trophoblast
differentiation method from donor fibroblasts and will confirm that these organoids phenotypically and
functionally behave like first trimester villous tissue. We will then test the hypothesis that the functional
capacity of trophoblast organoids derived from hiPSCs obtained from early-onset preeclampsia will be
impaired when compared to trophoblast organoids derived from non-hypertensive controls. In aim 2,
we will model maternal syndrome of preeclampsia in nude mice with factors made by human placenta.
To model human preeclampsia, we will generate trophoblast organoids using hiPSCs derived from
placental fibroblasts from women carrying a fetus with trisomy 13, a disorder characterized by 10-fold
excess risk of preeclampsia due to extra copy of sFLT1 gene on chromosome 13. We will then test in
vivo efficacy of monoclonal antibodies that target the unique C-terminus of human sFLT1-i14 (the
isoform that is primate-specific) for enhanced clearance of sFLT1 from systemic circulation. Due to the
organoid's ready access and ability to replicate the early stages of development from well-
characterized cells, the trophoblast organoid model promises to significantly improve our
understanding of preeclampsia and provides rapid screening methods for testing potential drugs
and furthering precision medicine methods in obstetrics. Our studies will have major implications
not only for the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, but also for short and long-term cardiovascular
complication in these women."
10907005,"We study how neural activity in the hippocampus and connected areas mediates their roles in learning and
memory. We are interested in circuit mechanisms responsible for activation of hippocampal units in precise
sequences that depict past and future behavioral trajectories. These sequences, called ""replays"", are attracting
increasing attention because of the unique way they allow a subject to re-experience events from another time
and place. Despite these intriguing features, several questions remain. We do not know how replays impact
other brain activity and what role they play in behavior. We also do not know how other circuits outside of the
hippocampus are involved in generating replays. Here, we will find answers to these questions, by recording
and manipulating neural activity, in hippocampus and in a closely connected area called entorhinal cortex, in
awake and freely behaving rats. (Aim 1) Previous attempts to disrupt replay have only revealed relatively
subtle effects on behavior. For example, disruption during a post-training consolidation period has relatively
weak effects on a spatial memory task. Here we present preliminary evidence that disrupting replay while a rat
learns a new goal location in a spatial memory task dramatically affects performance during a probe test
performed immediately afterward. We will use this effect to determine which parts of replays are important. For
example, it could be that replays must join up the goal location and more distant locations in the environment
to enable later navigation to the goal from those distant locations. These and other hypotheses will be tested
systematically to reveal how replay contributes to spatial learning. (Aim 2) The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC)
has been implicated in the representation of spatial goals, and in supporting longer hippocampal replays.
However, this latter result was found with only a partial suppressive effect on MEC activity, and in mice, where
replay is difficult to measure. We use an innovative new optogenetic technique using more penetrative
wavelengths of light, and an innovative form of optical fiber geometry, to shut down activity along the entire
length of the MEC in the rat. We will use this to look for stronger effects on hippocampal replay, and for effects
that are specific to certain types of replay, such as those that travel toward the goal. Further, we can test
whether MEC is necessary for replay-dependent spatial learning as shown in Aim 1. (Aim 3) We also use
advanced silicon probes to measure activity from hundreds of units along the length of the MEC. Therefore we
will look for replay within MEC itself, and how it relates to hippocampal replay. This has been controversial in
the literature, but with our increased cell yield we will be able to resolve this, and also examine sub-types of
MEC cell such as grid cells, border cells, head direction cells etc. Taken together, our results will provide
insight into fundamental mechanisms of learning and memory, that are affected in diseases such as
Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, stroke and normal aging."
10808078,"SUMMARY
A central component of diabetes pathogenesis is dysregulated secretion of insulin and glucagon from b and α
cells of the endocrine pancreas. Endocrine cells rely on protein quality control (QC) systems within the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to clear misfolded proteins, maintain ER homeostasis and ensure hormone
production. Misfolded proteins are removed in part through substrate-specific clearance by Sel1L-Hrd1 ER-
associated degradation (ERAD), or bulk degradation of aggregates by autophagy. Our recent study showed
that ERAD and autophagy regulate different aspects of β cell biology – maintenance of β cell identity and
survival, respectively. Despite their shared importance in controlling glucose homeostasis, our understanding
of α cell biology lags behind that of β cells. The mechanisms regulating ER homeostasis in (and thus, synthetic
capacity of) α cells remain largely unexplored. To this end, mouse models lacking Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD or
autophagy in α cells were characterized. Defective ERAD limited glucagon production and α cell mass, but did
not impair systemic glucagon secretion in response to hypoglycemia. In contrast, defective autophagy in α
cells disrupted ER homeostasis and impaired glucagon secretion in vivo. Intriguingly, our preliminary data
points to potential crosstalk between these two QC machineries. Hence, this proposal will test the
overarching hypothesis that Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD and autophagy cooperate to ensure ER proteostasis in
pancreatic α cells – which is critical for α cell identity, function and/or survival. Using a combination of in
vivo and in vitro genetic and pharmacologic approaches using mouse models, cell lines, and human islets, we
will test the following Aims: (1) Demonstrate the pathophysiological importance of the interplay between ERAD
and autophagy in α cells, and (2) Delineate the molecular mechanism underlying the crosstalk between ERAD
and autophagy in α cells. This study will provide unprecedented insights into ER QC mechanisms in α cells,
which may be harnessed to identify new therapeutic approaches to address α cell dysfunction in diabetes. This
undertaking will build upon Dr. Reinert’s scientific expertise in developmental biology and physiology with
training in two cutting-edge cell biology fields, ERAD and autophagy, with a focus on organelle crosstalk.
Moreover, this study will strengthen Dr. Reinert’s technical skills by providing training in state-of-the-art cell
biology techniques, thus paving a strong foundation for her future career as a physician scientist leading an
interdisciplinary team studying islet cell biology and pathophysiology. This career development award will be
overseen by three outstanding scientists and mentors Drs. Ling Qi, Peter Arvan, and Jiandie Lin at the
University of Michigan."

Neuropsychiatric disorders are the single greatest cause of disability due to non-communicable disease
worldwide, accounting for 14% of the global burden of disease. The current standards of care suffer from
subjectivity, inconsistent delivery, and limited access with growing waitlists. New informatics solutions, in
particular artificial intelligence (AI) that can port to more ubiquitous mobile health devices and that are not
restricted for use in clinical settings, have great potential to complement or even replace aspects of the standards
of care. We propose to develop a novel informatics solution for one of the most pressing mental health burdens,
autism, which is up in incidence by more than 600% since 1990, among the fastest growing pediatric concerns
today, and highly representative of many other neuropsychiatric conditions. We have invented a prototype
mobile system called Guess What (guesswhat.stanford.edu) (GW) that turns the focus of the camera on the
child through a fluid social engagement with his/her social partner that reinforces prosocial learning while
simultaneously measuring the child’s developmental learning progress. At its simplest level, the GW app
challenges the child to imitate social and emotion-centric prompts shown on the screen of a smartphone held
just above the eyes of the individual with whom the child is playing. But more, as a home-based repeat-use
system, GW uses computer vision algorithms and emotion classifiers integrated into gameplay to detect emotion
in the child’s face via the phone’s front camera, automatically finding agreement with the displayed prompt, while
capturing features such as gaze, eye contact, and joint attention. Preliminary work with more than 20 autistic
children resulted in positive user feedback, evidence of high engagement for both the parents and children, and
importantly, evidence of clinically meaningful gains in socialization. A single session produces 90 seconds of
enriched social video and sensor data, opening up an exciting opportunity for the game play itself to passively
generate labeled computer vision libraries that enable the development of better models with higher diagnostic
precision going forward. Our proposed project will show that GW can (a.) serve as a mobile therapy that can be
used repeatedly by families to target core deficits of autism while inherently tracking progress during use, and,
(b.) serve as a distributed system to crowdsource the acquisition of new labeled image libraries for AI models
that can automatically classify diagnostic features relevant to autism and extend to other sectors of mental health
(and even beyond)."
10897719,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Screening promotes early detection of cancer to decrease mortality. Unfortunately, significant racial disparities
exist in lung cancer screening. Recently published findings by our team show that under current national
screening guidelines African Americans have reduced eligibility for lung cancer screening compared to whites.
These screening guidelines are based on a combination of age and smoking pack-year criteria derived from a
national lung screening trial that was primarily (91%) white. Importantly, smoking behaviors and baseline risks
for lung cancer differ greatly between African Americans and whites. Because of this, a risk-based screening
strategy may provide a more equitable assessment of eligibility than current screening guidelines. However, the
development of personalized risk prediction models for lung cancer in African Americans has been limited. To
address this gap and to improve equity in screening eligibility, we propose building a personalized prediction tool
using the combined data from three large-scale population-based prospective cohorts with substantial African
American representation. The combined cohorts have over 336,000 individuals (44% African American) and
9,132 incident lung cancer cases from across the United States. We propose the following three aims: 1)
construct a well-calibrated natural-history model of lung cancer risk for screening in African Americans, 2)
evaluate lung cancer screening strategies by simulation and identify sub-populations who would benefit from
screening, accounting for comorbidities and false-positives, and 3) develop a web-based decision aid for
screening that is culturally appropriate. We will employ innovative machine learning techniques and state-of-the-
art statistical methods to build a well-calibrated lung cancer prediction model for African Americans. Careful
examination will identify sub-populations (such as women, low socioeconomic status, rural, age groups, etc.)
that will benefit from screening. A key innovative aspect of this proposal is its community-engaged approach and
partnership with a Community Advisory Board, both of which will help translate our empirical findings into the
design of a patient-oriented decision aid. This project is relevant to the mission of the National Cancer Institute
since it focuses on establishing equity in lung cancer screening eligibility. Our findings will have sustained impact
on precision health and motivate improved clinical strategies for the early detection of lung cancer for African
Americans."

Two major hurdles must be overcome to cure type 1 diabetes (T1D): (i) the autoimmune response and (ii) destruction of insulin-secreting islets/β cells. Immunotherapies, including improved immune regulation using ex vivo expanded regulatory T-cell (Tregs) or low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2), may be able to suppress autoimmunity. However, immunomodulation is not expected to directly stimulate regeneration of β cells. On the other hand, mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) possess both immunomodulatory and regenerative properties and represent a promising new intervention for autoimmune diseases. MSCs are an accepted therapeutic for wound healing in plastic surgery applications and are being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, ischemia reperfusion injuries, diabetes and other diseases. Our group and others found that after infusion into spontaneous non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, MSCs migrated into the injured pancreas, reduced hyperglycemia and attenuated Th1 immune responses concomitant with the expansion/proliferation of Tregs. Most importantly, MSC infusion led to increased mRNA expression of IL-2 and TGF-β receptors in pancreatic Treg cells in NOD mice. A pilot clinical trial in Sweden showed that a single infusion of autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs preserved insulin secretion in adult patients with new-onset T1D. This study has yet to be systemically tested in patients in the United States and no mechanistic studies have been reported that explain the benefit observed. MSCs derived from umbilical cord (UC-MSCs) show greater cell yield, a less invasive harvesting procedure with associated reduced morbidity, and stronger immunosuppressive and regenerative potential and are a popular source for cell therapy. Based on the above principles and the successful patient enrollment in our one-year R01 grant, we propose a renewal of a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, single-center clinical trial to determine the efficacy of UC-MSC therapy in patients with new-onset T1D. Our working hypothesis is that systemic administration of MSCs freshly expanded ex vivo reduces progression of diabetes and preserves insulin secretion through restoring normal function of the immune system and preservation/improvement of pancreatic β cells in patients with T1D. We will test this hypothesis by the following aims: (i). Determine the safety and efficacy of MSC therapy in patients with new-onset T1D when added to standard-of-care, and (ii) Define the mechanisms of protection and elucidate biomarker(s) of efficacy of MSC therapy in T1D patients. The early safety of MSC therapy is documented in our first 7 adult patients age 18-30 enrolled over 7 months and from multiple MSC Trials for various diseases. MSCs may constitute an important therapeutic advancement for T1D."
10813221,"Millions of individuals in the United States suffer from chronic pain and co-morbid depression,
conditions that are debilitating and complex to manage. A reason for the scarcity of safe and efficacious
therapies for these conditions is our limited knowledge of viable targets. Preclinical models of pain have shown
that microglia and astrocytes play a key role in the establishment and/or maintenance of pain and depressive
behaviors. Additionally, patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) demonstrate “pain-related” and
“depression-related” elevated levels of the glial marker 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO), suggesting that
pain and depressive symptoms may be mediated / maintained by neuroinflammatory mechanisms
 In this proposal, we will study whether cannabidiol (CBD), the primary centrally and peripherally active
non-intoxicating compound in the cannabis plant, exerts anti-neuroinflammatory effects in patients with cLBP
with mild-to-moderate depression. In animals, CBD induces analgesic and antidepressant effects, via a
complex pharmacology that includes the stimulation of cannabinoid receptors and the inhibition of pro-
inflammatory pathways in glial cells. These preclinical studies, and our observations linking neuroinflammation
to pain and comorbid depressive symptoms in cLBP, indicate that CBD may reduce both pain- and depression-
related neuroinflammation in cLBP patients. In addition to exerting possible anti-neuroinflammatory effects,
studies in psychiatric patients suggest that CBD might normalize striatal hypofunction, an alteration that our
group has also recently linked to depression in cLBP patients using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). Because of its purported effects as striatal physiology, we thus hypothesize that a secondary
mechanism of action of CBD may be to reduce striatal dysfunction.
 We will conduct a randomized, double-blind, 2-arm mechanistic trial to assess the effects of CBD (n =
40) and placebo (n = 40) in patients with cLBP with mild-to-moderate depression, using integrated positron
emission tomography / magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) scans. The use of integrated PET/MRI will
allow us to simultaneously evaluate neuroinflammation (using [11C]PBR28, a second-generation radioligand for
TSPO) and striatal function (using the Monetary Incentive Delay task, a validated fMRI task that probes
behavioral and neural responses to rewards and losses). In our mechanistic trial, we will use EPIDIOLEX®, an
FDA-approved product that contains a known and constant dose of purified CBD. We already hold an active
IND to test the effects of EPIDIOLEX® in cLBP with [11C]PBR28 PET/MRI, and preliminary data support our
hypotheses. By studying the neural and neuroimmune responses to CBD, this study will advance our
knowledge about the mechanisms of action of this drug, and help us understand which conditions might benefit
the most from its use. More broadly, our study will test whether modulating neuroinflammation is feasible and a
promising therapeutic approach for pain and depression."

A diverse scientific workforce is essential to fostering scientific innovation and excellence and
providing safe and quality learning and work environments. Despite extensive efforts and some
noteworthy progress, certain groups' underrepresentation remains a concern for the health-
related scientific workforce. Undergraduate research experiences, such as summer research
programs, have been shown to increase learning skills, career ambitions, completion of a STEM
degree, and advancement to a graduate program for undergraduate students, particularly those
from underrepresented groups in science. In response to

""Summer Research
Education Experience Program (R25)"", we propose the Syracuse University-Summer Training in
Alcohol Research (SU-STAR) program. The SU-STAR program aims to (1) recruit an annual
cohort of
five to seven undergraduate students from underrepresented groups
in science across
the nation who demonstrate academic potential as well as strong interests in alcohol and health
research and in advancing to a graduate school in related disciplines; (2) provide participants
with the opportunity to participate in a rigorous eight-week research internship and enrichment
activities, (3) conduct
ongoing evaluations during the summer program and bi-annual follow-ups
regarding the program's success in participant recruitment, retention, and educational and
career outcomes; and (4) disseminate program information and materials to the undergraduate
student body, academic units, and scientific community. Ultimately, this program will expand a
pipeline of diverse individuals in health research, which will enhance the science workforce's

10755611,"ABSTRACT. Veterans with chronic pain conditions such as migraine headache, fibromyalgia, and irritable
bowel syndrome frequently manifest comorbid internalizing psychiatric conditions such as mood and anxiety
disorders. The comorbidity between chronic pain conditions and internalizing disorders exacerbates the course
of both, contributes to increased opiate use and low quality of life, and leads to worse treatment outcomes.
While twin studies have indicated substantial overlap in genetic and environmental influences between
individual chronic pain conditions and internalizing disorders, progress in identifying specific genetic variants
underlying this relationship has been slow. To date, no studies have evaluated the relationship among chronic
pain conditions and internalizing disorders using molecular genetic methodology, those that allow for the
identification of specific genes, representing a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of the etiology of
these conditions. To address the glaring research gap, the present CDA-2 includes an observational cohort
study using data available from the Million Veteran Program (MVP) to examine the relationship between
chronic pain conditions and internalizing disorders. The MVP represents a unique and powerful resource for
evaluating these relationships through the combination of extensive electronic health record (EHR) and
genome-wide genetic data. Using data from this large and representative sample, the specific aims are to: 1)
derive chronic pain and internalizing disorder phenotypes from EHR; 2) evaluate the genetic overlap between
chronic pain conditions and internalizing disorders using genome-wide association study and linkage
disequilibrium (LD)-score regression; and 3) explore the causal relationships among chronic pain, internalizing
disorders, and opioid use with Mendelian randomization methods. Strengths of the proposal include the use of
large-scale EHR and genetic data to reveal the genetic contributions to the comorbidity among chronic pain
conditions and internalizing disorders, and the evaluation of multiple chronic pain conditions and internalizing
disorders at once. Understanding the shared genetic etiologies between chronic pain conditions and
internalizing disorders as well as potential causal mechanisms will provide targets for advancing therapeutic
intervention and facilitate the progression from genetic epidemiology to personalized medicine.
 The proposed CDA-2 will provide the candidate the training and research opportunities necessary to
advance a model of genetic comorbidity among chronic pain conditions and internalizing disorders and support
her long-term goal of becoming an independent researcher within the VA with a focus on genetic epidemiology
of chronic pain and psychiatric disorders, and the development of precision medicine approaches to the
treatment of Veterans with these conditions. Specific training goals include 1) gaining proficiency in the use of
EHR data for clinical and translational research; 2) formal training in molecular genetics; 3) expanding
knowledge of substantive issues underlying pain mechanisms and opioid medication use; and 4) research
ethics, grant writing, and professional development. The training plan consists of an interlocking program of
coursework, intensive mentoring, reading groups, seminar series, and conferences, with special attention to
training in research ethics. Direct mentoring from leading experts in each of the proposed training domains is a
fundamental feature of this proposal: primary mentor, Dr. Niloofar Afari (pain phenotyping), co-mentors Drs.
Richard Hauger (MVP expertise), Murray Stein (EHR data and psychiatric phenotyping), and Caroline
Nievergelt (statistical genetics), and consultants Drs. Matthew Panizzon (quantitative genetics), James Murphy
(EHR), Mark Wallace (pain and opioid use), and Wesley Thompson (biostatistics). The candidate will use these
skills and resources to accomplish the specific research aims of the study. Findings from this CDA-2 have the
potential to substantially increase understanding of the mechanisms that link chronic pain and internalizing
disorders and lead to targeted precision medicine interventions of these debilitating conditions in Veterans."
10806134,"Summary
The glymphatic and lymphatic systems are essential for waste drainage and fluid homeostasis of the central
nervous system (CNS). It has therefore been hypothesized that therapeutic efforts to maintain or accelerate
glymphatic/lymphatic functions throughout the life-span would be beneficial for preventing cognitive dysfunction.
Intriguingly, simple physiological maneuvers such as changes in body posture and/or deep-inspiratory breathing
affect the two systems and might therefore be therapeutically beneficial for sustaining a healthy brain. However,
an inherent problem in advancing such complementary therapeutics is the lack of knowledge pertaining to the
coupling between the two systems. The goal of our application is to uncover the mechanistic and physiological
controllers of the glymphatic/lymphatic coupling. A comprehensive investigation based on in vivo imaging, novel
computational fluid dynamic analysis and “omics” mapping of the lymphatic fluid will be used to test the
hypothesis that advective/diffusion transport modes of the glymphatic system operates synergistically with the
lymphatic system for optimal waste drainage and control of CNS fluid homeostasis via specific pathways such
as the Renin-Angiotensin system. We further hypothesize that physiological states (deep-inspiratory breathing,
body posture, stress/relaxation, etc.) differently affect aspects of glymphatic/lymphatic functioning and could be
externally modulated for health benefits. In SA1 we will address the important question of how the glymphatic
and lymphatic networks interconnect and regulate brain waste drainage in physiological conditions. By using
imaging and computational fluid dynamics analysis, in parallel with hemodynamic and intracranial pressure
monitoring we will map the advective/ diffusive solute transport of the glymphatic/lymphatic systems and their
response to key physiological parameters. Additionally, we will quantitatively map brain waste drainage to the
cervical lymph nodes under simple physiological manipulations such as ‘deep’ breathing using nasal continuous
positive airway pressure (CPAP). In SA2 we will address the consequences of physiological and mechanical
stressors on brain-lymphatic coupling and solute drainage. Specifically, we will use complementary therapeutic
approaches such as changes in body posture and animal models of spontaneous central and obstructive apnea
and test their modulatory roles on brain glymphatic function and lymph drainage. In SA3 we will perform a
comprehensive biochemical and biophysical analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and lymph, collected
through micro-cannulation under different physiological conditions, to map the molecular feed-back mechanisms
involved in CSF homeostasis and fluid drainage. Overall, our highly innovative proposal aims at a rigorous
characterization of the physiological mechanisms regulating the cross-talk between the glymphatic/lymphatic
systems and their role in CNS fluid control and brain waste drainage. An additional and crucial strength of this
application is the complementary expertise of the team, which is conducive to the execution of biochemical and
biophysical integrative experiments which, would not be possible to perform in isolation, by a single laboratory."

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are devastating and fatal
neurodegenerative diseases that strike middle-aged adults just as they reach full familial, financial and career
potential. Initially thought to be quite distinct, FTLD and ALS are now recognized to share many clinical,
pathological, and genetic signatures, but the mechanistic basis of their shared and distinct circuitry remains
unknown at the molecular level. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered multiple common
weak-effect variants, but the vast majority are non-coding, making it difficult to identify their target genes and
the cell types where they act. To address this challenge, in Aim 1, we systematically profile the transcriptional
and epigenomic alterations of FTLD and ALS patients at single-cell resolution using post-mortem brain
samples. In Aim 2, we integrate the resulting datasets to study the link between genetic, epigenomic,
transcriptional, and cellular signatures of FTLD and ALS, and to study the common and distinct genes and
pathways altered in each, to predict new therapeutic targets. In Aim 3, we validate the molecular and cellular
effects of these targets using high-throughput directed perturbation experiments and both cell-autonomous and
non-autonomous phenotypes guided by our predicted pathways, and we disseminate all our results to the
community. The resulting datasets, analyses, and validated targets will provide an invaluable resource to
understand the mechanisms of action of FTLD and ALS, and the common and unique circuitry towards new
therapeutic targets."
10794916,"ABSTRACT
Over 300 million people worldwide suffer from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), a heterogenous disorder with
no cure. MDD is associated with hippocampal-dependent memory impairments, including severe working
memory (WM) deficits. The encoding and consolidation of newly acquired experiences rely on the finely tuned
interplay between pyramidal excitatory neurons and GABAergic parvalbumin positive (PV) interneurons that
control the excitation to inhibition (E/I) balance in the hippocampus. The interplay between these two neuronal
populations in the hippocampus results in the temporally coordinated firing of pyramidal neurons that give rise
to theta/gamma oscillations and sharp wave ripple (SWR) events, underlying the proper encoding and
consolidation of information, respectively.
 In patients suffering from MDD both encoding and consolidation of experiences are impaired due to a shift
in their hippocampal E/I balance to a less excitatory state. Strikingly, our lab has shown that the antidepressant
venlafaxine rescues WM in a stress mouse model through increasing gamma oscillations and SWR abundance
in the hippocampus. This increase was dependent on Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a gelatinase that
remodels the extracellular matrix and is altered in MDD. Following in this line of research, my dissertation focuses
on the role of MMP-9 activity in the proper functioning of hippocampal-dependent neuronal networks in the
zebrafish. My behavioral data indicates that MMP-9 inhibition impairs WM, which was accompanied by changes
in the E/I balance in the hippocampus to a less excitatory state as evidenced by a decrease in SWR abundance.
Additionally, my proteomics data suggest that the shift in E/I balance can be explained by changes in both
pyramidal and PV neurons. For instance, plasminogen, a marker for excitatory neuronal activity was significantly
decreased after MMP-9 inhibition. Components of the Perineuronal Nets (PNN), that regulate the firing of PV
neurons, such as versican, were significantly increased. These changes contribute to a less excitatory
hippocampus similar to what we see in patients suffering from MDD. My data then postulates MMP-9 activity
modulation as a potential therapeutic target to treating depression-related symptoms.
 For the D-SPAN F99/K00 training grant, I have two specific aims. For Aim 1 (F99 phase) I have outlined
my progress thus far and how I will master whole-cell patch clamp and optical sensing recordings to distinguish
how MMP-9 inhibition differentially affects the intrinsic properties of pyramidal and PV neurons and whether
theta/gamma oscillations are also affected. After successfully graduating, for the K00 phase I will join my ideal
postdoctoral lab at an R1 institution dedicated to scientific excellence, professional and intellectual development,
networking, and increasing and retaining diverse scientists in academia. I will also continue studying the cellular
and molecular mechanisms leading to neural circuitry impairment during degeneration while fostering my training
towards becoming a well-rounded neuroscientist researcher and mentor."

 Rural residents with endometrial cancer (EC), the most prevalent gynecologic cancer in the US, have 8-
17% higher odds of mortality than their urban counterparts. As the number of new EC cases is expected to
increase 50% by 2030, this urban-rural disparity is expected to continue widening. Contributing to this disparity
is the reduced receipt of guideline-concordant treatment; in particular, rural patients with EC are less likely to
receive comprehensive surgical care, the cornerstone of regional stage EC treatment.
 The overall objective of this project is to identify and target multilevel barriers to receiving guideline-
concordant treatment among rural EC patients by developing and piloting a patient navigation intervention.
Patient navigation interventions can address a multitude of barriers faced by medically underserved cancer
patients and have been shown to shorten time to initiating treatment, increase receipt of and adherence to
treatment, and improve patient satisfaction. However, because of the substantial variation in the design and
delivery of patient navigation interventions, developing effective and cost-effective interventions for new
contexts and populations has become a major challenge; among treatment-related patient navigation
interventions, most have focused on patients with breast and colorectal cancers. Unlike these cancer patients,
EC patients have different needs, such as requiring treatment to be directed by a gynecologic oncologist, who
often are only located near urban areas or at academic medical centers. Only 10% of gynecologic oncologists
practice in rural areas, and as a result, rural EC patients often travel far distances for care. In the proposed
study, I will identify multilevel barriers to receiving guideline-concordant treatment among rural women with EC
(Aim 1), use intervention mapping to design a patient navigation intervention (Aim 2), and pilot a patient
navigation intervention (Aim 3). Using intervention mapping to design an EC navigation intervention will not
only precisely target the multilevel barriers to treatment but also will optimize the fit and implementation of the
navigation program within the gynecologic oncology setting. This approach is novel in that it integrates the
identification of appropriate implementation strategies into the program’s design.
 This project will provide preliminary data for an R01 application to test the developed patient navigation
intervention in a Type 1, hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial. The expected outcomes of this study will
contribute to the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities’ mission of using interventions to
eliminate health disparities among medically underserved populations. Additionally, I will receive training in (1)
community-engaged research methods to understand the multi-level determinants of cancer care equity, (2)
designing interventions to fit specific populations and context, and (3) conducting intervention studies. This
project will contribute to my long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator who develops and
evaluates interventions to reduce disparities in cancer care and outcomes among underserved populations."

The ability to regenerate tissue in mammals has remained elusive. While the use of stem cell populations in
the context of bio-scaffolds has shown promise as a potential means of replacing lost, damaged, or diseased
tissue, significant challenges remain. An alternative approach is to attempt to evoke a classical in situ
regenerative response emulating that seen in lower species such as newts. While this trait was thought to be
lost in evolution, our observation (Heber-Katz) that the MRL mouse and related strains have a significant
spontaneous regenerative capability demonstrates that the trait is retained in mammals. Studies over the past
almost 25 years have culminated in the identification of the HIF-1 (hypoxia inducible factor) pathway as the
central actor regulating regeneration in mice. The up-regulation of HIF-1 in non-regenerating mice have
allowed these mice to regenerate ear holes with cartilage and hair follicles; and jaw bone and associated soft
tissues after induced periodontal disease (PD). In both cases, a classical regenerative de-differentiation
response was seen. This was achieved using the PHD inhibitor 1,4-DPCA in novel injectable biomaterial
constructs (Messersmith) leading to the stabilization of high levels of HIF-1 in vivo. The mechanisms that
were identified in the PD model involved inflammatory cytokines, bone remodeling osteoblasts, Tregs and
CXCR4 expression. Using a CXCR antagonist, AMD3100, the regenerative response could be blocked and
supports the need for Tregs and certain stem and myeloid cells.
 In this current proposal, we provide preliminary results showing that two new upstream target
molecules DEL-1 (Hajishengallis) and PAR1 (Heber-Katz) with known agonists have been identified which
affect HIF-1 expression. We will explore the role of HIF-1 and these two molecules in the regenerative
response in young and aged mice using both the ear hole model and the PD model.
 We will use advanced molecular design to produce a biomaterial capable of achieving single dose
and local delivery vs the current three dose delivery system. In addition to yielding a novel soft and bone tissue
regeneration therapy, we believe that this system provides an impressive landscape of phenomena that will
yield important mechanistic information about in-situ regenerative responses in oral tissues.
In Aim 1, we will create new biomaterials to yield local drug release using mucoadhesive polymers; in Aim 2,
we will examine the role of the anti-inflammatory molecular DEL-1 in aged mice with PD, a molecule having
direct affects on HIF-1 levels; and in Aim 3, we will examine the role of PAR1, another molecule which affects
HIF-1 levels in the ear hole and periodontal injury models, in both young and aged mice."
10763876,"Lipid droplets (LDs), the organelles responsible for lipid storage and the largest energy reserve in most cell types,
are the defining characteristic and etiological factor in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD). Moreover, LDs are recognized to play central roles in coupling NAFLD to more systemic comorbidities
such as Type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease among others. LDs interact with numerous organelles,
especially ER and mitochondria, which are thought to coordinate de novo LD biogenesis and fatty acid (FA)
transfer/oxidation, respectively. However, published work from our laboratory and others have questioned the
established dogma that direct transfer of FAs from LDs to mitochondria is the primary route of their oxidation
during fasting. Using a multifaceted approach involving organelle proteomics, isotope tracing, and numerous
super resolution microscopy approaches, we show for the first time that in the liver, the proteomes and
metabolism of mitochondria attached to LDs (peridroplet mitochondria, PDM) support lipid anabolic pathways,
whereas mitochondria unattached to LDs (cytosolic mitochondria, CM) a geared for enhanced FA oxidation and
OXPHOS. Moreover, our data point to an important role for mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAMs), an
ER domain that tightly interacts with mitochondria, as a key component in regulating LD-mitochondria
interactions and dynamics. Collectively, these data suggest that interactions with LDs profoundly affect organelle
dynamics and function. Based upon these data, the objective of this application is to define how LD interactions
affect lipid metabolism and sensing to coordinate ER and mitochondrial function under physiological and
pathophysiological conditions. We hypothesize that interactions of LDs with ER and mitochondria are critical
modulators of MAM lipid sensing and mitochondrial function that govern hepatic lipid and energy metabolism.
To test this hypothesis, we propose the following three specific aims: Aim 1 - To comprehensively define LD-
mitochondria interactions and their impact on FA trafficking; Aim 2 - To determine the mechanisms through which
subpopulations of MAM differentially impact mitochondrial bioenergetics and lipid metabolism; and Aim 3 - To
determine how NAFLD impacts LD/MAM/mitochondria dynamics in NAFLD. To complete these aims, we will
employ a wide range of advanced super resolution imaging approaches, proteomics and RNA sequencing,
isotope tracing, and other cell biology and biochemical approaches in cells, mouse models and human liver
biopsies. Upon completion of these studies, we will expect that we will have revealed novel mechanisms through
which LDs can alter cellular function/dysfunction that underlie NAFLD etiology. We anticipate that this work will
open new areas of research into intracellular signaling dynamics, which will advance therapeutic approaches
targeting NAFLD and related comorbidities."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease, yet the relevant autoantigens for β-cell destruction are poorly
defined, especially in humans. There is evidence that insulin is the driving antigen in early anti-islet autoimmunity,
however, with disease progression antibodies against other antigens arise, indicating that islet damage is
accompanied by antigen spreading. Therefore, the antigens relevant for β-cell destruction during disease
initiation might differ from those leading to advanced disease. Knowledge of which antigens mediate β-cell
autoimmunity in established T1D has significant clinical importance for emerging cell replacement strategies
using autologous induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). IPSC-β-cells will likely trigger expansion of memory
anti-β-cell T cells leading to graft destruction. The identification of dominant antigens and epitopes for autograft
rejection could find immediate therapeutic applications as iPSC-β-cells invisible to the immune system of people
with T1D could be produced by gene editing. To probe antigen specificity of anti-β-cell memory CD4+ T cells
and assess whether functionally relevant antigen spreading occurs, we have developed relevant tools. These
include MHC-II tetramers, single-cell assays to characterize activation states of CD4+ T cells and paired TCR
sequencing, NOD mice carrying edited autoantigens, as well as an autologous system of iPSC-β-cells and
peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) derived from people carrying the T1D-associated human leukocyte antigen
class II DQ8 variant. The proposed project will build on these tools to study MHC-II-mediated antigen
presentation and the memory CD4+ T cell response in people with long-standing T1D. To accomplish this, in
Aim 1 we will compare the CD4+ T cell repertoire in young non-diabetic and diabetic NOD mice during graft
rejection and evaluate the extent of antigen spreading. To guide the effort of discovering new antigens in the
memory repertoire, we will conduct immunopeptidome studies in β-cells and functionally test candidate antigens
in presentation assays. These experiments will evaluate the memory CD4+ T cell repertoire in mice and provide
insight into functionally relevant antigen spreading in a preclinical model. In Aim 2, we will use a similar approach
to study the human memory CD4+ T cell repertoire by establishing co-cultures and a humanized mouse model
of iPSC-β-cells and PBMCs. We will then edit candidate autoantigens and epitopes in iPSCs and test their
function in memory CD4+ T cell stimulation and graft rejection. This high-risk, high-reward project, co-led by a
T1D immunologist and an expert in β-cell biology and iPSCs, has substantial translational impact and builds
upon technological advances that our team has developed."

Following infection, naïve CD8+ T cells differentiate into effector or memory T cells, which help to eliminate
pathogens and maintain long-term immunity. Despite decades of research, it is still not clear why some naïve
CD8+ T cells become effectors and die, whereas others survive and become long-lived memory cells. The
canonical model posits that a single lineage of CD8+ T cells undergoes phenotypic diversification after
stimulation. However, our published work and preliminary data show that there are separate lineages of CD8+
T cells (fetal-derived and adult-derived) in the starting population, which are made during distinct windows of
development and differentiate along different pathways during infection. This model suggests that the division
of labor within the CD8+ T cell compartment is mediated by distinct ontogenetic lineages, similar to
subpopulations of B cells (B1a, B1b, B2), which have unique functional capabilities. However, unlike the B cell
field, the T cell field lacks a useful marker to identify fetal- and adult-derived CD8+ T cells in adult mice, and we
still do not fully understand the underlying basis for their altered behavior. Based on our preliminary data and
published findings, we have identified a scavenger receptor (CD163L1) that is specifically expressed on fetal-
derived CD8+ T cells and contributes to their more rapid innate-like functions. In Aim 1, we will establish whether
CD163L1 is a marker for fetal-derived CD8+ T cells. In Aim 2, we will examine how CD163L1 alters the functions
of CD8+ T cells. Our proposal is expected to open up new avenues of research and advance our conceptual
understanding of the CD8+ T cell response to infection."

Microbial resistance against current medications is on the rise, with the serious threat of bacteria becoming
immune against all available drugs. There is no doubt that a renewed focus on anti-infective compounds is highly
desired to prevent potential epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases. Daptomycin is an FDA-approved
antibiotic for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections. It has a strict requirement for calcium to fulfill its
antibiotic activity. Recent reports highlight the resistance of different strains against daptomycin. This urges the
need for the development of next generation daptomycin antibiotics to circumvent resistance. However, the
complexity of daptomycin’s chemical structure hinders modifying this antibiotic via traditional synthetic
approaches. We have recently reported a novel chemoenzymatic method for the synthesis of specific
daptomycin derivatives with stronger in vitro activity against daptomycin-susceptible and resistant bacteria. The
new analogs, in contrast to the parent molecule, do not require calcium for antibacterial activity suggesting a
new mechanism of action. The goal of this proposal is to study the new mechanism of the newly developed
analogs in in vitro and in vivo models. We will use multidisciplinary approaches at the interface of chemistry and
biology to provide more depth on the mechanisms and activity of the newly generated analogs. Specific Aim 1
will study the physicochemical and microscopic properties of our daptomycin derivatives to reveal the
mechanisms of the newly synthesized compounds. Specific Aim 2 will study the new chemoenzymatically-
synthesized derivatives in animal models to provide information on their in vivo activity and pharmacokinetics.
This proposal emphasizes translational research and will lead to the development of stronger antibiotics that
circumvent resistance. Hence this study will have a significant impact on multiple avenues that could lead to
bridging these compounds to the clinic. Overall, the proposal will lay the groundwork for a research program that
integrates in vivo activity, microbiology, physicochemical properties and mechanistic insights to access new
routes to daptomycin biological diversity. The results obtained from this study will be extended to other
lipopeptide antibiotics in terms of their microbial resistance and activity. This research will highlight the
importance of chemoenzymatic approaches to complement synthetic ones to modify other bioactive compounds.
This proposal will also align with my lab’s overall goal to address the constant need to expand the chemical
space of small molecules to meet rising challenges of resistant microbes and improve their selectivity."

10775771,"Project Summary
Anti-microbial antibodies are predictive of Crohn’s disease (CD) diagnosis and are present in patients’ serum up
to 5 years before diagnosis, and their accumulation is associated with complications, often requiring bowel
resection surgery. In patients with CD, more bacteria translocate to the mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT)
compared to controls and a subset of bacteria are exclusive to CD MAT. This coincides with the expansion of
the MAT and its wrapping around the intestine, or “creeping fat”, a hallmark of inflamed CD-affected tissue, which
also correlates with complications. The etiology of anti-microbial antibodies and creeping fat are unknown.
Although B cells and stromal cells co-localize within fat-associated lymphoid clusters in creeping fat, and B and
plasma cell signatures are among the most highly upregulated genes in creeping fat compared to healthy MAT,
B cell function in this tissue is unknown. We hypothesize that the translocation of microbes to MAT prompts
stromal cells in fat-associated lymphoid clusters to recruit B cells, which differentiate into protective IgM-secreting
plasma cells, inhibiting systemic dissemination of bacterial antigens. Sustained CD-specific bacterial
translocation to the MAT leads to chronic inflammation activating stromal cells to secrete cytokines driving IgG
class-switch and differentiation to inflammatory anti-microbial IgG-secreting plasma cells. Adipocyte-derived
leptin is elevated in MAT of CD patients and drives inflammation in mouse colitis models. As leptin activates B
cells, we posit leptin further drives preferential class-switch to IgG. We will address this hypothesis in germfree
mice reconstituted with cultured collections of bacteria isolated from CD or healthy donors, as well as in human
MAT associated or not with inflamed intestine from patients with CD undergoing bowel resection surgery at
Mount Sinai. In these models, we will evaluate which bacteria translocate to the MAT, how they activate stromal
cells by deep characterization at the transcriptional and protein level and how they drive leptin production by
adipocytes in biopsy cultures (Aim 1). Next, we will investigate direct and indirect effects of CD microbiota on
MAT B cells and their shift from protective IgM to inflammatory IgG. To do so we will characterize CD microbiota-
driven changes in B cell activation, proliferation, class-switching and differentiation to plasma cells. We will also
determine the IgG-inducing properties of MAT and stromal cells exposed in vivo to CD or healthy donor
microbiota. Finally, we will investigate how CD microbiota perturbs stromal-B cell cross-talk within fat-associated
lymphoid clusters (Aim 2). By showing that MAT is able to mount microbiota-specific B cell responses, this
proposal will expand the study of mucosal immunology to mucosa-associated adipose tissues. Since creeping
fat and anti-microbial IgG correlate with complications in CD, these studies have the potential to uncover
mechanisms underlying CD pathology and identify needed therapeutic targets."
10881657,"Severe sepsis complicated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is a leading cause of death in
ICU. Acute lung injury (ALI) is an important component of MODS and often serves as a direct cause of death.
Nonetheless, few effective therapeutic targets for ALI have been identified. Our long-term goal is to determine
the mechanisms by which sepsis promote ALI, thereby potentially identifying novel targets for prophylactic
intervention. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), a new member of the lymphoid population, play a central role in
innate immunity of host response to inflammation, infection, and tissue damage. ILCs are composed of three
subgroups, ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3. ILC2 are a main ILC subtype in the lungs in both human and mouse, and
play an important role in maintaining airway barrier integrity and lung tissue homeostasis. However, the role of
ILC2 in sepsis-induced ALI remains unclear. This research project aims to understand the regulatory role of
ILC2 in the development and progression of ALI and the mechanism underlying ILC2 mobilization, migration,
and expansion in the lung in sepsis through three Specific Aims (SA): SA1. To determine the role of ILC2 in the
progression of ALI following sepsis; SA2 To determine the mechanism underlying ILC2 mobilization from BM
and migration into the lung in sepsis; and SA3 To determine the mechanism of ILC2 expansion in the lung in
sepsis. The results of the study will serve as essential foundation for potential novel treatment of ALI in sepsis
by regulating ILC2 migration, expansion, and function."
10873050,"Abstract
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for patients with high-
risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, HSCT is affected by graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and graft-
versus-leukemia (GvL) effects, both are mediated by donor T lymphocytes and significantly impact treatment
success and thus overall outcome. AML patients commonly harbor FLT3/internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD),
a mutation in the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 that is associated with poor prognosis. FLT3 targeted therapies
have proven clinical benefit particularly when used in combinational approaches. Midostaurin (a kinase inhibitor)
was recently approved for pre-transplant patients with FLT3-ITD in combination with standard therapy. In addition
to their direct leukemia suppressive effects, FLT3 inhibitors activate leukemia antigen-specific T-cell responses.
T-cell receptors (TCRs) are proteins expressed on the surface of T cells that recognize antigens presented by
MHC molecules. We recently characterized the TCR repertoire in patients who underwent matched donor or
haplo-cord HSCT. We demonstrated that GvHD and relapse (exclusive of each other) are associated with lower
TCR repertoire diversity and expansion of certain T-cell clones. Our data suggest that individual variations in
the immune repertoire significantly impact the clinical outcome in AML patients and underscore the need
for comprehensive quantitative, functional, and mechanistic analyses of the TCR repertoire in a large
cohort of AML patients. Here, we hypothesize: 1) TCR repertoire (diversity, clonal expansion, and V-segment
utilization) affects clinical outcome (GvHD or relapse) and can therefore be used to identify GvL- and GvHD-
associated clones; 2) Somatic mutations in leukemic cells (e.g., FLT3-ITD) affect the TCR repertoire and
subsequent expansion of specific T-cell clones; and 3) FLT3 inhibitors (e.g., midostaurin) modulate the TCR
repertoire and function and enhance GvL effects in patients undergoing HSCT. We will conduct a prospective
longitudinal cohort study characterizing the TCR repertoire and mutational landscape of leukemia cells in ~250
patients (~ 60–80 with FLT3-ITD). GvHD or relapse will be predicted using a proportional hazards model for
competing risks based on TCR repertoire characteristics. TCR sequences and somatic mutations will be
analyzed using a structure based prediction algorithms we developed to predict candidate leukemia neoantigens
and associated TCR clones. Neoantigens will be validated using in vitro and murine models. Finally, functional
analyses will examine the effect of midostaurin on TCR repertoire and function. Our findings will establish the
TCR repertoire as a useful tool for predicting clinical outcomes of HSCT and identify responsible TCR clones.
The identification of TCR clones associated with the GvL effect against FLT3-ITD+ cells will facilitate the
development of engineered T cells expressing GvL-associated TCR clones. Modifying the TCR repertoire
composition via therapies targeting specific somatic mutations will facilitate development of optimized
combinational therapeutic approaches, such as the addition of targeted therapy to post-transplant regimens."

Background: My laboratory works at the interface of cell biology and nucleic acid chemistry to
modulate translation, splicing, and transcription. Ideal projects have three features: 1) Novel
oligonucleotides that allow us to probe the strengths and weakness of the chemical modifications; 2)
Challenging nucleic acid structures or mechanisms for nucleic acid-mediated regulation; and 3) The
opportunity to gain insights into significant biological process or therapeutic development. For 2021-
2026 our central goal is to investigate mechanisms of RNA recognition to gain greater insights into
cell physiology and therapeutic development.
 Since 2016, several nucleic acid drugs have been approved and oligonucleotide medicine is
poised to have a significant impact on broad patient populations. One obstacle to realizing this
potential is an incomplete understanding of RNA recognition in cells. For example, while over 1000
peer-reviewed publications appear every month that cite the term “miRNA”, we lack the detailed
insights necessary to necessary to predict function or appreciate the roles of RNA in complex
biological processes. Validation of proposed effects is often problematic and the predictive power for
studying novel genes is limited. We will focus on two project areas involving the recognition of RNA
within either the nuclei or cytoplasm of human cells.
 Cooperation of miRNAs and protein factors during RNAi. We will gain fundamental
insights into the mechanism of RNA using knock out cell lines deficient for key RNAi factors including
proteins of the argonaute (AGO) and trinucleotide repeat containing protein 6 (TNRC6) families. We
will combine mass spectrometry, RNAseq, and cross linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) to define
where interactions occur how the number of protein or miRNAs affect the impact on gene regulation.
We will first examine detailed mechanisms for regulation in cell cytoplasm. We will then apply these
lessons to investigate the consequences of miRNA recognition in both cell cytoplasm and nuclei.
 Novel mechanisms and disease targets. We will gain a better understanding of two
diseases caused by mutant RNAs, Fuch's Corneal Endothelial Dystrophy (FECD) and Friedreich's
Ataxia (FA). One goal is to develop more potent compounds to facilitate drug development. A second
goal is to better understand mechanisms of action. Both diseases involve nuclear noncoding RNAs,
and we will use synthetic nucleic acids as tools to probe disease mechanism and better appreciate
how a small number of mutant RNA molecules can cause late-onset degenerative diseases."
10896084,"Project Summary
 In the Spring of 2020, Maryland introduced policies to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including closures of schools,
child care, and work sites, and social distancing requirements. Based on the Family Stress Model (FSM), the economic
losses and social disruptions associated with COVID-19 policies can undermine family routines, resulting in negative
impacts on children's health behaviors and risk for obesity/excess weight gain. Guided by the FSM, we implemented a
rapid-response research project in Spring 2020 to examine disparities (race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, and locale)
resulting from COVID-19 policies by merging two ongoing federally funded obesity prevention trials (school and child
care). Enrolled families have children age 3-15 years and live in 10 rural, urban, and suburban Maryland counties.
Families repeated pre-pandemic evaluations, including diet screeners, objectively measured activity/sleep (accelerometry),
surveys on family routines, food insecurity, well-being, etc., in addition to supplemental COVID-19-related surveys and
interviews. Data collection recently ended, with 563 families evaluated. This proposed study extends the rapid-response
project to include: (1) the long-term impact of COVID-19 policies on disparities related to children's health over two
years following the pandemic start, (2) measures of obesity and an analysis of projected impact on health care costs, (3) an
explanatory mixed methods approach to understand the mechanisms linking COVID-19 policies and health behaviors.
This study is time-sensitive in that follow-up data must be collected during Spring 2021 (the first year anniversary of the
pandemic), to understand the impact of COVID-19 policies on childhood obesity and health behaviors over time.
 Specifically, this study aims to (1) examine changes over time [4 data points: before the pandemic, onset (spring
2020), 2 years following (2021-2023)] in child health behaviors (diet, physical activity, and sleep) and obesity/excess
weight gain, (2) examine the mechanisms explaining observed changes in child health behaviors and obesity/excess
weight gain (mixed methods, focusing on family routines and child emotional health), and (3) determine projected health
care costs related to changes in child health behaviors and obesity/excess weight gain due to COVID-19 pandemic control
policies overall and for specific populations, by race/ethnicity, SES, and geographic locale. Specific hypotheses seek to
examine the impact on health disparities, the link between health behaviors and excess weight gain during the pandemic,
and linkages within the components of the FSM.
 This proposed study has significant relevance to public health along at least three areas. First, findings will quantify
the impact of the COVID-19 policies on children's health behaviors and obesity/excess weight gain, thus facilitating
planning on strategies to promote children's health during recovery and to consider in planning for future pandemics and
disasters. Second, findings related to health and social disparities provides information on the vulnerabilities of groups
and issues to consider in planning for future disasters to reduce disparities. Finally, findings related to projected health
care costs related to child health during the pandemic will inform the future public health agenda with respect to necessary
investments in obesity treatment and prevention."
10850965,"PROJECT SUMMARY: POSTDOCTORAL TRAINING IN SUICIDE RESEARCH
Suicidal behavior is a major public health problem with over 47,000 deaths by suicide in the United States in
2017 and over 1,400,000 suicide attempts. Unfortunately, rates of suicide deaths and attempts have increased
in recent years. There have been multiple calls for increased research on all aspects of suicidal behavior
ranging from basic experimental to clinical trials to implementation efforts. Yet the cadre of researchers
necessary to conduct this vitally needed research is limited. There is currently only one other T32 postdoctoral
training program focused exclusively on suicide research, with only six training slots. Thus, there is a pressing
need for more training in suicide research. Brown has a established cadre of suicide researchers including 10
senior level researchers, as well as 5 junior level suicide researchers. These faculty’s research focus covers a
broad range of suicide research, spanning basic and predictive research, intervention, and implementation
science. Other faculty at Brown offer a wide range of expertise in research areas that are highly
complementary to important questions in suicide research, such as sleep, genetics, implementation science,
big data, and statistics. Our faculty has extensive experience training new investigators; one of the MPIs of this
application (Dr. Miller) led a very successful T32 (T32MH067553) in “Treatment Research” for 10 years. Other
senior investigators have successfully mentored a number of postdoctoral fellows. Finally, Brown has a well
established and successful infrastructure for research training, including five other NIH funded T32 programs
(none of which focus of suicide). This postdoctoral training program will be directed jointly by Drs. Ivan Miller
and Lauren Weinstock. Drs. Miller and Weinstock are established investigators with a history of conducting
suicide research. With a plan to enroll three new postdoctoral fellows (PhDs and MDs) per year for a 2-3 year
postdoctoral fellowship experience, the research training plan will be based on the apprenticeship model.
Based on the fellow’s interests and overlap with faculty’s expertise, each fellow will be assigned to a senior
suicide researcher as a Primary Mentor. Each fellow will also have a Co-Mentor, either a junior suicide
researcher or a senior researcher with complementary expertise. Developed collaboratively between fellow
and Mentor(s), the research training program will typically include five components: (1) supervised participation
in the ongoing work of an established research team led by the primary mentor; (2) development of an
independent research application to be submitted by the end of the first training year; (3) participation in a
formal didactic program including seminars on suicide research, research design, and ethics; (4) data analysis
and manuscript preparation from existing faculty data; and (5) an independent research project conducted over
two years, supervised by the primary mentor, that will include formulation of the question, data analysis, and
manuscript preparation."
10789881,"Project Summary/Abstract
Research Project: Compared to their male peers, female adolescents show markedly more internalizing
problems (i.e., anxiety and depression), which increase risk for subsequent disorder and severe impairment
across the lifespan. Identifying risk processes associated with girls’ internalizing problems, prior to the period of
acute risk in adolescence, is necessary to understand the etiology of internalizing disorders and to develop
innovative prevention programs. Parent emotion socialization (ES), and specifically parents’ emotional and
physiological responses to their children’s emotions, is constrained by youth internalizing problems and
portends the onset of internalizing disorders. Previous studies on parent ES have not employed a microlevel,
within-dyad approach across multiple levels of analysis. Moment-to-moment ES processes within a dyadic
interaction may differ between dyads, such that girls’ internalizing problems may alter the effects of changes
in girls’ emotions on subsequent changes in their parents’ emotions and physiological reactivity. Among dyads
with girls who exhibit elevated internalizing problems, parents may reciprocate adolescent anger, but suppress
their anger in response to youth dysphoria, constituting a maladaptive coercive cycle that reinforces or
exacerbates adolescent internalizing problems. In these dyads, adolescent negative emotions may also hinder
parent vagal withdrawal, an index of rapid physiological regulation. 100 parents and their daughters (ages 6-11
years) will participate in a dyadic dysphoric mood discussion, wherein each dyad members’ vagal functioning
will be continuously monitored. Second-by-second estimates of parent and youth anger and dysphoria will be
coded from videorecorded interactions, and time-varying estimates of vagal withdrawal will be obtained.
Multiple informants (parents, daughters, and teachers) will complete multiple validated measures of girls’
internalizing problems. The proposed project employs a multimodal and dynamic ES perspective to
understanding school-aged girls’ internalizing problems. Knowledge gained will improve traction on dyadic
emotion processes that will accelerate innovations in future research and intervention efforts.
Training Plan and Environment: The proposed training and research activities build on PI Somers’ extensive
background in developmental psychopathology, developmental psychobiology, and quantitative methods and
are designed to launch her independent research career. The proposed research project will be buttressed by
a rigorous training plan overseen by expert mentors in developmental psychopathology, psychophysiology,
and advanced statistics. Via research, coursework, mentorship, and professional development activities, this
plan leverages the rich resources available in the Departments of Psychology and Biostatistics at UCLA. By
the end of this award, PI Somers will be well positioned to transition to a research career as a developmental
psychopathologist who studies dyadic biobehavioral processes that influence child wellbeing among at-risk
families."
10877674,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) are clinically valuable because they display regenerative properties of self-
renewal and the ability to produce an entire hematopoietic system through multilineage differentiation. In other
words, HSC can make all mature blood cell types such as myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid and they sustain
those blood types long-term in the organism. These regenerative properties make them an idea therapeutic tool
for treating hematological malignancies by transplantation from a healthy donor, however a shortage of donors
has prompted the effort to generate HSCs from alternative sources such as patient derived iPSCs. Knowledge
about molecular mechanisms of HSC formation is needed to aid those efforts. HSCs are formed in early
embryonic development alongside other HSC-independent Progenitor Cells (HPCs). One major difference
between them is that HPCs are more limited in their differentiation repertoire compared to HSCs. We aim to
study the differences between HSCs and HPCs to further advance our understanding of the specific molecular
drivers of HSC regenerative properties. Understanding how HSCs acquire the ability to differentiate and self-
renew in development can aid the efforts for generating them in vitro from alternative sources such as patient
derived tissues or cord blood sources. Current molecular markers are insufficient for distinguishing HSCs from
all other HPC subtypes. Moreover, most experimental systems require the removal of these cells from their
native environment to study their functionality using in vitro culture assays or transplantation, which will measure
the potential of a cell but may not reflect its actual endogenous function. Genetic experiments in mice and
zebrafish showed that HSC and HPC fate can be molecularly uncoupled, implying that unique drivers of HSC
formation exist. What genes are responsible for the formation of the rare population of HSCs independently from
HPCs? To address this question, we established a genetic lineage tracing approach that measures HSC and
HPC differentiation without removing them from their native environment. Using this assay, we found that HSCs
show a significant delay in their ability to differentiate to myeloid and lymphoid lineages relative to HPCs, and
this finding agrees with others in the field. The assay allows us to assess HSC differentiation in vivo, uncoupled
from HPCs. We propose to use this functional tool in combination with other molecular and genetic assays to
address the following aims: (1) Determine the differentiation potential of HSCs and HPCs in vivo and (2) Perform
a reverse genetic screen for regulators of HSC differentiation. Our findings can aid the efforts to generate HSCs
from alternative sources for clinical use."
10874396,"ABSTRACT
Asthma is an inflammatory lung disease that affects >300 million people worldwide. Although mild asthma is
driven by a Th2-associated, eosinophil-dominated immune response, factors such as obesity/metabolic
dysfunction are associated with more severe asthma. Thus, the “obese asthma” endotype is associated with
frequent asthma exacerbations, a shift away from Th2-dominated inflammation towards a Th17-dominated
profile, and a marked female bias. A major gap in our understanding of mechanisms driving obese asthma is
due to deficiencies in common mouse models of obesity; standard high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mouse models are
unable to induce extensive weight gain and metabolic dysfunction (associated with obesity in humans) in female
mice - a major shortcoming given the female bias observed in the obese asthma endotype. Importantly, our
group has determined that HFD feeding of C57BL/6 mice housed at a temperature in which they are at metabolic
homeostasis (thermoneutral temperature (TN); 30-33°C) promotes severe obesity and metabolic dysfunction in
female mice. Preliminary data using this model demonstrate that allergen-challenged obese asthmatic mice
demonstrate: (1) worse asthmatic outcomes compared to lean asthma controls, (2) a shift away from Th2
inflammation to a pro-inflammatory profile (Th17 or Th2/Th17), and (3) a pronounced female bias. Similar
changes are NOT observed in male mice. These data suggest that TN housed obese female asthmatic mice
model the human obese asthma endotype. Importantly, obese asthmatic female mice demonstrated a profound
increase in the frequency of IL-17A-producing cells in the lungs, particularly mucosal-associated invariant T
(MAIT) cells. MAIT cells are innate-like T cells abundant in lungs, liver, and adipose tissue. Although considered
protective in models of lean asthma, in obesity, liver and adipose tissue MAIT switch to a pro-inflammatory state
and contribute to metabolic dysfunction. In this application we hypothesize that, in obesity, liver and adipose
tissue MAIT cells become pro-inflammatory and are licensed to migrate to the lung, where they drive
severe asthma outcomes in female obese-asthmatic mice. This hypothesis will be tested in two Specific
Aims. Aim 1: To define the functional and phenotypic differences of tissue resident MAIT cells in obese
asthmatic females. We will examine patterns of MAIT cell accumulation and cytokine expression in lung and
metabolic tissue (liver, white adipose tissue) over time, quantify differential MAIT cell responsiveness to TCR-
dependent and independent signals, and perform non-biased transcriptional profiling of lung MAIT cells from
lean and obese asthmatic female mice. Aim 2: To determine the role of MAIT cells in asthma outcomes in
obese female mice. We will treat lean and obese asthmatic mice with a MAIT cell inhibitory ligand or adoptively
transfer lung MAIT cells from lean or obese asthmatic mice and assess their necessity and sufficiency on the
asthma phenotype. Completion of the proposed studies will facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms
underlying the unique clinical parameters associated with “obese asthma” and MAIT cell biology."

This K25 Mentored Quantitative Research Development Award project proposal is to allow the PI, Dr. Marmar
Moussa - an experienced Computer Scientist and Bioinformatician - to obtain additional training in cancer
genomics and cellular and molecular cancer biology needed to lead an interdisciplinary research lab and
prepare the PI to become a fully independent investigator. To that end, Dr. Moussa assembled an outstanding
mentoring committee of world-class scientists and physicians from University of Connecticut and Harvard
University and provided a comprehensive training plan to meet her career goals. Additionally, Dr. Moussa’s
research goal is to develop advanced computational approaches to investigate and model the mechanisms of
the alternative serrated pathway of human colon carcinogenesis. This research complements Dr. Moussa’s
career development plan and promotes her path to achieve independence.
 Despite increased colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention efforts in recent years, CRC remains the second
leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. CRC develops from a series of genetic and epigenetic
changes described by two pathways; the well-studied ’conventional adenoma-carcinoma sequence’ and the
less understood ’alternative serrated pathway’. The serrated pathway, characterized by the precursor Serrated
Lesions, is increasingly described over the past decade to be contributing to 15 - 35% of CRC tumorigenesis
and even more in ’interval’ CRC (I-CRC). It is therefore significant for surveillance and early detection to identify
which at-risk lesions progress along this pathway, and how. This is the focus of this proposal.
 Characterization of the serrated lesion pathway of colon carcinogenesis has been difficult due to the het-
erogeneity and the absence of comprehensive longitudinal data in humans. Single cell sequencing is the best
tool for studying heterogeneity, and far exceeds the power of histology in this regard. In addition, a wealth of
thousands of pre-cancerous and CRC samples is available to this study from the PI’s institution. Dr. Moussa
will develop computational approaches to the genomic, and state-of-the-art single cell epigenetic (ATAC-Seq)
and transcriptomic analyses of human samples to accurately characterize distinct and subtype-specific phe-
notypes and elucidate the mechanisms by which carcinogenesis occurs in the human colon via the serrated
pathway (Aim1). Additionally, the PI proposes interrogating the new and groundbreaking spatially-resolved
transcriptomics of archival Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) samples using novel computational ap-
proaches to identify distinct molecular patterns within otherwise histologically similar serrated lesions/polyps
(Aim2). Elucidating the mechanisms of precursor lesion progression along the serrated pathway will help im-
prove clinical predictability and identify factors that extend prevention well beyond polyp detection and removal."

The principal investigator (PI), Dr. Supriya Mohile, of this K24 renewal proposal leads an independently funded
patient-oriented geriatric oncology research program at the University of Rochester Wilmot Cancer Institute.
Over the last K24 funding period, Dr. Mohile completed two large multi-site cluster-randomized trials that
evaluated whether geriatric assessment and management (GAM) improves outcomes of older patients with
advanced cancer. GAM, a validated patient-centered approach for assessing health status, identifies older
patients with cancer who are at risk of adverse outcomes and guides management for cancer treatment and for
aging-related conditions. Both trials demonstrated, for the first time, that a GAM intervention improves patient-
centered outcomes (communication and patient/caregiver satisfaction) and clinical outcomes (treatment
toxicity, falls, and polypharmacy). Integrally involved in this research, mentees at the University of Rochester
and through the Cancer and Aging Research Group (CARG) have utilized data from the GAM trials to
successfully compete for their own career development and independent awards. Of the ten early career
scientists that Dr. Mohile currently mentors at the University of Rochester, eight are women and four identify as
underrepresented in medicine. Mentees have received over 20 grants and have published over 80 manuscripts
with Dr. Mohile. Dr. Mohile is currently a primary mentor or co-mentor on seven career development awards.
Further, over the last K24 funding period, Dr. Mohile successfully competed for three new R-level awards as PI
from the Patient Centered Outcomes Research and the National Institutes of Health to evaluate strategies for
implementing GAM in oncology practices and to expand understanding about cancer treatment tolerability in
older adults. The original K24 allowed Dr. Mohile and her mentees to enhance skills in communication
research; the renewal will allow them to learn about implementation science and leadership with expert
consultants at the University of Rochester and in CARG. The overarching aims of this proposal are: 1) to
develop and evaluate implementation strategies for GAM in oncology practices; and 2) to examine treatment
tolerability in older patients with advanced cancer and aging-related conditions starting a new high-risk cancer
treatment regimen. This research will have a positive impact by providing information on pragmatic
mechanisms for implementing GAM in oncology care. Importantly, this proposal will allow for the career
development of mentees pursuing patient-oriented research focused on geriatric oncology, an understudied
field. Through funded research, an endowment from the Wilmot Cancer Institute, and the NIA-funded CARG
(MPI: Mohile), Dr. Mohile has the resources to continue to foster the careers of investigators interested in
geriatric oncology research across the academic career trajectory. The renewal of this K24 Award will enable
Dr. Mohile to expand mentoring to enhance the growth of patient-oriented research in geriatric oncology."

Preeclampsia (PE) is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States which has led to
an urgent need to accurately predict its risk. It is not known how nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the
liver manifestation of metabolic syndrome and the most prevalent liver disease among women, contributes to
PE risk. The long-term objective of this proposal is to define the relationship between NAFLD and PE, to
identify strategies to reduce the risk of PE, and to improve short- and long-term maternal outcomes in this
population. This project will evaluate the independent association of NAFLD with PE among overweight and
obese women. It will also study relevant lipid alterations in women with NAFLD in pregnancy which are
associated with endothelial dysfunction that leads to the clinical syndrome of PE, among NAFLD (compared to
non-NAFLD) patients during pregnancy. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) To prospectively assess
whether NAFLD is an independent risk factor for: i) PE among overweight/obese women and ii) PE with liver
injury; (2) To determine whether women with NAFLD in pregnancy have altered levels of bioactive lipids
associated with endothelial cell dysfunction, compared with women without NAFLD in pregnancy. This study
will be performed in the Mount Sinai Health System, which provides care to a diverse and multiethnic patient
population disproportionately affected by both NAFLD and PE. This application will support the candidate's
career development into an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on the influence of liver disease
in pregnancy on preeclampsia risk and future maternal cardiovascular and liver health, a significant unmet
need. The proposed career development plan integrates advanced coursework in translational epidemiology,
lipidomics assessment, prospective study design/ analysis, and biostatistics, and experiential learning through
the conduct of the proposed research plan, all within a highly supportive research environment. The
mentorship team which includes senior investigators with expertise in epidemiologic and translational research
in hepatology (Friedman and Terrault), preeclampsia (Roberts), and prospective study design and advanced
biostatistical analysis (Sigel), will guide the candidate's research and career development. The superb
institutional infrastructure for developing successful clinical investigators and the substantial institutional
commitment to the candidate greatly strengthen this application. At the conclusion of this proposal's funding
period, Dr. Kushner will be optimally positioned as an independent physician-investigator studying the
intersection of liver disease and PE, and their implications on future maternal health."

from normoxic, viable tissue to hypoxic, damaged tissue. A site of regional dysfunction exists at the interface
between the normoxic and hypoxic tissue, known as the border zone. Reperfusion restores the flow of blood and
O2 to the tissue, but also induces ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI), a pathophysiology resulting in further tissue
damage. The pathological processes underlying these hypoxic cardiac injuries are not definitively established,
in part due to a lack of experimental tools to recapitulate the diverse spatiotemporal O2 gradients characteristic
of MI and IRI. The goal of this proposal is to engineer microphysiological systems with tight O2 control to
investigate the molecular pathways activated in O2 gradients, and the resulting effects on cardiomyocyte (CM)
function, to obtain a comprehensive view of the cardiac response to hypoxic injury. The aims outlined in this
proposal will build on the expertise of Dr. Rexius in controlling O2 levels using microfluidics and integrate Heart-
on-a-Chip technologies to advance the functional and mechanistic understanding of hypoxic cardiac injury. In
the mentored phase, Dr. Rexius will use engineering and pharmacological approaches to control paracrine
interactions in an MI border zone microdevice model and determine the role of paracrine-mediated hypoxic-
normoxic intercellular communication in defining the spatial metabolic heterogeneity across an O2 gradient (Aim
1). Proteomic and miRNA analysis will be used to identify and validate transfer of exosome cargo as a paracrine
mechanism altering CM metabolism. The existing O2 control framework will be utilized to engineer a
microphysiological system to model IRI and multiplex measurements of traction force, sarcomere shortening,
and calcium transients, and their dependence on O2 tension, to monitor dysfunction with live imaging (Aim 2). In
the independent phase, modified versions of these systems will examine the effect of O2 reperfusion rate on CM
function and the regulation of autophagy, a process by which cellular material is degraded and recycled (Aim 3).
 The project and mentorship plan will allow Dr. Rexius to develop skills in (1) non-invasive optical
measurements of metabolic parameters, (2) bioinformatics analysis of exosome proteomic and miRNA datasets,
(3) traction force microscopy, and (4) communication, mentoring, and laboratory management to prepare to lead
an independent research program in academia. Dr. Rexius will be co-mentored by Dr. Megan McCain at the
University of Southern California (USC) and Dr. Ching-Ling (Ellen) Lien at the Keck School of Medicine of USC
and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. Dr. Rexius has also enlisted Dr. Keyue Shen (USC) and Dr. Jennifer Van
Eyk (Cedars-Sinai) as advisors to support her scientific and professional development. Completion of the aims
will reveal novel insights into CM responses in heterogeneous O2 landscapes."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is historically described as an endocrine (β-cell) specific autoimmune disease. However,
reduced pancreatic size and subclinical exocrine insufficiency are also present at T1D diagnosis. The
mechanisms, natural history, and role of these findings in T1D pathogenesis remains unclear. Exocrine atrophy
may even precede the onset of multiple islet autoantibodies (Stage 1 T1D) in some subjects, signifying that
clinical measures of exocrine mass and function could be helpful early T1D biomarkers. The primary objective
of this proposal is to establish the natural history of exocrine loss in pre-T1D and to identify exocrine T1D-
predictive biomarkers. We will measure fecal elastase (FE-1), a clinical marker of exocrine function, throughout
the course of pre-T1D within TEDDY (The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young) subject banked
samples (Aim 1A). An enrolling R01-funded study of TrialNet (TN) subjects (Campbell-Thompson and Haller,
mPIs) will prospectively examine pancreas volume by MRI in single islet autoantibody positive (AAb+), multiple
AAb+, and AAb- T1D first degree relatives (FDRs) to evaluate its prognostic utility. Herein we propose to add
evaluation of serum and stool exocrine functional markers in this complementary population to evaluate their
prognostic utility and determine timing of exocrine loss (Aim 1B). We hypothesize that exocrine markers will be
reduced prior to Stage 1 T1D in those destined for progression and that their rate of decline can be used to
predict disease onset. Lastly, the mechanisms underlying reduced exocrine pancreatic mass and function in T1D
remain unclear; leading hypotheses include a lack of insulin secretion or autoimmunity to exocrine tissue leading
to pancreas atrophy. The secondary objective of this study will use samples from the Network for Pancreatic
Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD) cohort to investigate these potential mechanisms and evaluate exocrine
pancreatic autoantibodies as biomarkers of risk (Aim 2). We hypothesize that exocrine autoimmunity is present
in subjects with multiple islet AAb+ and those with clinical T1D and leads to diminished exocrine mass and
function. We hypothesize that insulinopenia is present in those with clinical T1D and leads to further exocrine
atrophy. If our hypothesis is proven, this will represent a paradigm shift in our traditional understanding of the
pathogenesis of T1D as an endocrine-specific autoimmune disease. This proposal will advance my early career
goal to better understanding the timing and role of T1D exocrine pancreas changes and apply this knowledge in
prevention and intervention trials. The skills set forth within this research proposal and career development plan
will promote independence as a clinical investigator and include collaborations in several large T1D research
consortia and training in 1) human subjects research trial design, implementation, and analysis 2) biomarker
evaluation and 3) translational science design and technique. The collaborative rapport, excellent mentorship,
and mission of training the next generation of investigators across University of Florida institutes and
departments provides an ideal environment for career success."
10818517,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sexual assault is a persistent public health problem that affects a substantial proportion of college women and
is often associated with increases in heavy drinking to cope with post-assault distress. Survivors often recover
within social networks such as sororities where heavy drinking is normative, and recovery alongside heavy
drinking peers can exacerbate survivors’ drinking to cope. To address this problem, the current application
involves the development of a novel intervention designed to promote effective support of survivors within
social networks of sororities. Support behaviors incompatible with heavy drinking are expected to increase
perceived support among survivors and reduce alcohol use and related consequences among all intervention
recipients. The research plan involves: (1) developing a new web-based intervention in collaboration with
community stakeholders, (2) testing the feasibility of the intervention within a pilot cluster randomized trial, and
(3) examining network characteristics associated with adoption of support behaviors. This Mentored Clinical
Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) will provide Dr. Anna Jaffe with the research support and
training needed to become an independent researcher in the field of alcohol research. Dr. Jaffe has a strong
foundation researching the intersection between alcohol use and sexual assault, but requires additional
training to become an intervention researcher capable of contributing to broad change by leveraging
technology to administer brief interventions within social networks. To facilitate this training, Drs. Mary Larimer,
Christine Lee, and Cynthia Stappenbeck will provide mentorship in intervention development and evaluation
with relevance to alcohol use, peers, and sexual assault. Additionally, Drs. Nancy Barnett and Tyler
McCormick will provide mentorship in social network methodology and related statistical analyses. The
University of Washington is an ideal environment for conducting this research and obtaining the content,
methodological, and statistical expertise necessary to develop an independent career in alcohol intervention
research. The proposed project will provide pilot data to support a R01 submission to test the intervention on a
larger scale and evaluate the spread of supportive behaviors through social networks. This highly innovative
research plan is consistent with NIAAA strategic goals in the creation of a low-resource technology-based
intervention that has the potential to significantly impact public health by improving peer support to survivors of
sexual assault and reduce heavy drinking on a broad scale."

 Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth initiate gender-affirming medical therapy as early as Tanner
Stage 2 with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) for puberty suppression, with variable timing
of gender-affirming sex hormones (GAH). Peak bone mass, achieved during puberty and young adulthood,
largely determines age-related fractures in later life. There is compelling evidence that pre-treatment bone
mineral density (BMD) is low in TGD youth, and that peak bone mass attainment may be attenuated in
transfeminine youth. TGD youth who initiate GnRHa in early puberty develop bone geometry distinct from
those who start in late puberty. All published longitudinal studies on bone measures in TGD youth have
initiated GAH around 16 years (Dutch Model), and no studies have described skeletal trajectories of TGD
youth who initiate GnRHa in early puberty and follow a peer-concordant puberty-timing model with GAH by 14
years. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate the trajectory of bone mass, architecture, and
strength in TGD youth who follow the peer-concordant puberty-timing model, and to assess the
determinants of skeletal health in this population. Dr. Lee will enroll 30 participants from her existing cohort
of early pubertal TGD youth who have had detailed bone measures prior to and during the first year of GnRHa.
She will determine the skeletal measures during 3 years of GAH by utilizing dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
(DXA) to quantify BMD accrual and BMD Z-score changes (Aim 1). Dr. Lee will correlate DXA measures to
high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) for bone architecture and strength
estimate changes at weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing sites, and at diaphyseal sites to examine muscle
mass and density (Aim 2). She found that low pre-treatment BMD in early pubertal TGD youth was associated
with low physical activity and that grip strength was a positive predictor of failure load. Dr. Lee will utilize thigh-
mounted tri-axial accelerometers to measure intensity/duration of physical activity/sedentary time and hand-
grip and knee extension dynamometry to measure isometric strength to develop threshold targets for future
intervention studies (Aim 3). Dr. Lee has assembled a cross-disciplinary mentor team with the necessary
expertise to achieve these aims and receive training in the endocrinology of bone and transgender medicine,
adolescent DXA and HR-pQCT interpretation, biomechanical load evaluation and muscle strength testing,
cohort study implementation, and complex longitudinal data analysis. The proposed research will generate
data for Dr. Lee to develop a larger R01 prospective study to follow skeletal trajectories until peak bone mass
attainment in order to optimize treatment protocols to mitigate potential impairment in peak bone mass accrual,
which could impact future fracture risk. Dr. Lee is committed to rigorous investigation of skeletal development
in TGD youth receiving gender-affirming medical therapies and is confident that this K23 proposal will prepare
her for her long-term goal of being an independent physician-scientist focused on bone health in TGD youth."
10812996,"Targeting Systems Vulnerabilities in the Gαq/GNAQ Oncogenic Signaling Circuitry: New Precision
Therapies for Uveal Melanoma
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest family of cell surface proteins involved in signal
transmission. GPCRs play key physiological roles and their dysfunction contributes to some of the most prevalent
human diseases, making them the target of >25% of all therapeutic drugs. Strikingly, our recent analysis of
human cancer genomes revealed an unanticipated high frequency of mutations in G proteins and GPCRs in
most tumor types. Indeed, nearly 30% of human cancers harbor mutations in GPCRs or G proteins. While their
tumorigenic potential is under investigation, activating mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 (herein referred as GNAQ
oncogenes, which encode GTPase deficient and constitutively active Gαq proteins), were identified in ~93% of
uveal melanoma (UM) and 4% of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), respectively, where they act as oncogenic
drivers. UM is the most common primary cancer of the eye in adults, affecting more than 2,500 patients each
year in the US alone, nearly 50% of which will die from liver metastasis. To date, there are no effective therapeutic
options to treat metastatic UM disease (mUM). We recently demonstrated that YAP activation is central to UM
growth and uncovered a novel direct link between Gαq-FAK driven tyrosine phosphorylation networks and YAP
activation. Our central hypothesis is that this signaling specificity may represent a systems vulnerability that can
be exploited for the development of new precision therapies for mUM. Our overall hypothesis is that our proposed
studies targeting FAK, which acts downstream from Gαq, and its compensatory (resistance) or synthetic lethal
(sensitizing) mechanisms will provide an oncogene-specific therapeutic approach for advanced and mUM,
resulting in increased antitumor activity with lower toxicities and fewer side effects. Ultimately, our premise is
that FAK is an integral part of the GNAQ oncogenic pathway and that in turn, FAK blockade with clinically relevant
FAK inhibitors (FAKi) may represent a precision therapeutic approach for the treatment of mUM, alone or as part
or as part of novel signal transduction-based precision co-targeting strategies. This will be investigated in 3 aims:
Aim 1: To exploit GNAQ-synthetic lethal and gene interaction networks to expose systems vulnerabilities
resulting in UM cell death as a precision therapeutic approach to treat mUM. Aim 2. To establish the therapeutic
potential of co-targeting the Gαq-FAK regulated pathway in vivo. Aim 3. Characterization of FAKi/MEKi tolerant
persister populations and mechanisms of acquired resistance"

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could behave similar to the influenza virus, re-
emerging every year in slightly different forms. More importantly, SARS-CoV-2 keeps making various mutants
with higher infection rates than previous ones. The spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 binds to host angiotensin-
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein to mediate viral entry. The replication of SARS-CoV-2 depends on two
essential viral proteases: 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro). The goal of
this application is to selectively target 3CLpro to inhibit virus replication. We plan to develop the host matrix
metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) as a degrader of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro to specifically inhibit replication of SARS-
CoV-2. The MMP14 is important for various cellular process through its proteolytic activity. We demonstrated
that MMP14 directly binds and selectively cleaves the viral 3CLpro at multiple locations. Consequently, replication
of SARS-CoV-2 Pseudovirus was inhibited by overexpression of active MMP14 in HEK293T cells. We have
engineered a novel inactive form of MMP14 (pro-PL-MMP14) containing viral PLpro cleavage site between pro-
domain and active MMP14 to increase target specificity for SARS-CoV-2. Thus, only SARS-CoV-2 PLpro can
release pro-domain to convert inactive to active form of MMP14. Furthermore, our results show that MMP14 is
enriched in isolated exosomes. Corneal mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes have been suggested as a
new strategy to deliver therapeutic agents. Here we propose to use the engineered pro-PL-MMP14, which can
be delivered by the pro-PL-MMP14/hACE2 or pro-PL-MMP14/DX600-laden exosomes, to specifically degrade
the viral 3CLpro, in the infected and susceptible cells, leading to inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication, as a novel
therapeutic agent. We propose two specific aims: (1) Characterize the engineered pro-PL-MMP14 and its ability
to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication; (2) Develop advanced pro-PL-MMP14-laden exosomes for specific delivery.
We will complete these aims using innovative techniques from molecular biology, biophysics, and molecular
virology."

This proposed research career development program seeks to investigate the impact of DNA
hypomethylation on genome organization and the mechanisms by which it drives downstream
tumor suppressive transcriptional programs. The candidate is currently a clinical and research
fellow in the Department of Pathology of the Massachusetts General Hospital. The proposal
incorporates specific technical skills that will be required for the project including training in
advanced microscopy methods, CRISPR techniques and repetitive element biology. The structured
career development plan includes training and mentorship in laboratory management, scientific
leadership, research communication, grant writing, and other critical career skills. These technical
and career skills will be acquired under the guidance of Dr. Bradley Bernstein, who will serve as
primary mentor and has a history of trainees that obtain group leader positions in academia, as
well as a Research Advisory Committee of world-class scientists including Drs. Kathleen Burns,
Ting Wu, Keith Joung and Nir Hacohen. Through this comprehensive program the candidate will
acquire a unique set of clinical and research skills that will enable her to transition to an
independent physician scientist faculty position with a lab focused on basic mechanisms and
therapeutic opportunities in cancer epigenetics.
DNA hypomethylation is an epigenetic alteration found in most solid tumors, but its functional
consequences are not clearly defined. DNA demethylating therapies are widely used in the clinic
for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and a subset of leukemias, and have recently been
shown to sensitize tumor cells to immunotherapy, possibly through activation of ERVs. Despite
this, the functional consequences of DNA hypomethylation and ERV activation remain obscure.
This project explores the mechanistic basis of findings in the candidate’s recent study of genome
organization in primary colon tumors. The results link DNA hypomethylation to striking changes in
the organization of chromatin compartments that are associated with tumor suppressive
transcriptional programs, including induction of ERVs. The aims of this proposal are to: (1)
Investigate if DNA hypomethylation causes chromatin reorganization, (2) test if massive ERV
upregulation is a mechanistic link between hypomethylation and compartment reorganization and
(3) determine impact of downstream transcriptional programs. These studies will uncover novel
epigenetic mechanisms that impact tumor cell identity and lay the foundation for deploying
demethylating therapies in new clinical settings to harness tumor-suppressive consequences of
DNA hypomethylation."
10814949,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT.
Polypharmacy is a highly prevalent problem in older adults, particularly in those with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
and AD-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) and those residing in the nursing home (NH). Many older adults
continue to receive medications originally prescribed for disease prevention until the end of life, despite a lack
of sufficient evidence to justify their continued use in advanced age. The use of bisphosphonates for fracture
prevention is one example. Although bisphosphonates are effective in reducing fractures in healthier,
community-dwelling individuals, there is insufficient evidence of continued benefits that is generalizable for NH
residents with AD/ADRD. There is also substantial clinical heterogeneity in this population with regards to
fracture risk, mobility, and life expectancy, creating further uncertainty as to whether all NH residents with
AD/ADRD benefit from bisphosphonate use. Deprescribing is a patient-centered approach to reduce or stop
medications that are no longer appropriate considering goals of care, time until benefit, and life expectancy.
Considering the lack of strong generalizable evidence and potential for side effects, bisphosphonates may be
targeted for deprescribing in NH residents with AD/ADRD. Deprescribing may also be justifiable considering
the extended period of benefit of bisphosphonates, which may last for up to 2 years after discontinuation
exceeding the life expectancy of many residents with AD/ADRD. However, no studies to date have evaluated
the appropriateness of deprescribing bisphosphonates as a means to reduce the burden of polypharmacy and
adverse effects in this population. Large observational studies of secondary data are uniquely positioned to
evaluate the benefits and harms of medication use and deprescribing in older NH residents with AD/ADRD,
given the barriers to conducting randomized studies in this population. This study will evaluate determinants,
clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of deprescribing bisphosphonates in NH residents with AD/ADRD. In
Aim 1, we will conduct a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to identify determinants of
deprescribing bisphosphonates from the perspectives of family/informal caregivers and prescribers of
NH residents with AD/ADRD. In Aim 2, we will conduct an observational study of Medicare
administrative data to evaluate clinical outcomes (fractures and adverse effects) associated with
deprescribing bisphosphonates in a sample of older NH residents with AD/ADRD. In Aim 3, we will
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of deprescribing bisphosphonates in NH residents with AD/ADRD,
considering medication costs and utilization for fractures and adverse effects. This study will address a
critical gap in knowledge and inform future recommendations for optimizing bisphosphonate use to prevent
fractures in this vulnerable and medically complex population. This award will also provide the principal
investigator with protected time to develop skills in qualitative research methods, advanced techniques to
reduce confounding in observational studies, and methods for cost-effectiveness analyses."

Cancers have readily-defined characteristics often referred to as “hallmarks”. Nevertheless, the question of
how the sequence of cancer development progresses -- from normal tissue to carcinogen-damaged tissue to
precancerous lesion and finally to malignant tumors – remains unanswered. Classically, these steps are
attributed to the sequential acquisition of discrete genetic events such as driver mutations. However, in
humans, the clonal dynamics governing cancer development happen over years, remain largely invisible even
in model systems, and have been difficult to link to specific molecular changes. This rubric fails to account for
clonal dynamics in the context of tissue architecture and fails to explain the consequences of large numbers of
mutations present in normal tissue. Our long-term goal is to apply ecological and evolutionary principles to
cancer initiation and development in order to test whether the hallmarks of cancer are acquired in three
distinct phases each with distinct selective pressures and manifestations of cell competition and
cooperation.
Nowhere is this more accessible to investigation than in skin. For skin carcinomas, the most important
carcinogen is ultraviolet radiation. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) has the most tractable and
clinically well-characterized progression sequence of any human cancer, from normal tissue, to a distinct
precancerous lesion (the actinic keratosis), to invasive carcinoma. Therefore, it is ideal for establishing an eco-
evolutionary paradigm of cancer initiation and development with respect to modelling clonal dynamics, genetic
composition and the dynamics of molecular traits.
Our central hypothesis is that cancer initiation and development occurs in three phases, each with specific
and recognizable clonal dynamics. In the first phase, tissue disruption from UV exposure provides a permissive
environment where extrinsically-driven mechanisms allow for some clones to experience unusually long runs of
cell division and turnover. This greatly increases the variance among clone sizes with larger clones
accumulating greater heritable variation. The second phase sees the emergence of intrinsic mechanisms
where mutations that confer a competitive advantage allow for clonal selection with directed expansion of
some clones at the expense of others. In the third phase, one or several clones escape local tissue control,
acquire a distinct fitness function, and form tumors. Within the emerging tumor microenvironments, selection
pressures will promote ecological and molecular diversification of the malignant clade (or clades). Our
approach uses novel combinations of serial in-vivo quantitative imaging, mathematical modeling, and deep
single-cell molecular interrogation to discern the ecological and molecular drivers of clonal dynamics, cell-to-
cell competition and cooperation, and clonal evolution, producing a fundamentally unprecedented view of
cancer initiation."
10794341,"Our previous community-based participatory research at Northeast Cape (NEC) on St. Lawrence Island (SLI)
found elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and mercury
(Hg) in sediments and biota within the watershed at the formerly used defense (FUD) site. We found elevated
OCPs and PCBs in serum of the SLI people due to both long-range transport and military-derived sources, with
the highest levels of PCBs in people who have traditional and familial connections with NEC, including
subsistence. Concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in our resident fish model, the stickleback,
closely mirror concentrations in the blood serum of SLI residents, indicating their efficacy as sentinel species
on SLI. Despite extensive remediation at NEC, short-lived lower trophic level fish in the Suqitughneq (Suqi)
River remain contaminated with PCBs, OCPs, and Hg originating from the FUD site, at levels that exceed EPA
fish consumption guidelines for cancer risk. Elevated contaminant levels and disrupted health in Suqi River fish
indicate potential health threats for residents and that site remediation is incomplete. Our overarching goal is to
advance scientific understanding of the exposure pathways and long-term human health consequences
associated with contaminant exposure from FUD sites and inform interventions necessary to protect the health
and long-term well-being of the people of SLI as they re-establish their traditional community at NEC. In Aim 1,
we propose to build on our prior discoveries and continue our collaboration with the communities of SLI to
investigate potential exposure pathways and biological impacts of persistent contamination associated with the
FUD site at NEC on SLI. We will analyze PCBs, OCPs, and Hg in the water of the Suqi and Tapisaggak rivers,
as well as in traditional foods and air samples to assess ingestion and inhalation as potential exposure
pathways. We will build on work with stickleback as a sentinel species to determine biological effects of
contaminants on endocrine function and organ-specific histopathology. In Aim 2, we will characterize and
quantify body burden of contaminants, and linkages to health outcomes, in people associated with NEC. In Aim
3, we will inform decisions and interventions to protect the health of the people of SLI and enable re-
establishment of the traditional community at NEC. We will provide information that will lead to improved
remediation, provide data and traditional knowledge to inform public health consultations and assessments,
and develop a community-based public health action plan and interventions to protect health, ensure equity in
decision-making, and restore the NEC community. This study will have local and circumpolar arctic
implications for Indigenous communities. Locally, we will provide data and implement actions necessary for re-
establishing the community at NEC. Given that thousands of such Cold War military sites exist throughout the
Arctic, often in close proximity to Indigenous communities, our project may serve as a model for environmental
and health monitoring and policy action by other Arctic Indigenous Peoples."

The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms by which acute kidney injury (AKI) leads to
acute cardiac dysfunction. Clinically, AKI-mediated cardiac dysfunction is known as cardiorenal syndrome type
3 (CRS3). The mechanisms underpinning CRS3 are not well understood and few plausible mediators of CRS3
have been identified. We recently demonstrated that ischemic AKI causes cardiac dysfunction in mice which
was associated with a 50% reduction in cardiac ATP levels. Thus, cardiac energy metabolism and production
is impaired during AKI and is a fundamental characteristic of CRS3. To identify mediators of CRS3, we
examined plasma and cardiac metabolites. We expected to identify increased levels of circulating metabolites
that might affect cardiac energy metabolism. Rather, we found that numerous metabolites necessary to
maintain cardiac energy production and anti-oxidant defense were deficient in the plasma and heart after AKI,
including over a dozen amino acids and the anti-oxidant glutathione. During cardiac stress, amino acids are
essential substrates for ATP production. Glutamine is particularly important since it can be metabolized to
substrates for both ATP and glutathione synthesis. Glutathione is the most abundant anti-oxidant in the heart
and is critical to maintain normal energy production since excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) impairs
mitochondrial function and inhibits oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). OXPHOS occurs within mitochondria
and is normally the major mechanism of cardiac ATP production. Our preliminary data demonstrate that during
AKI: 1) cardiac mitochondrial function and OXPHOS are impaired, 2) cardiac superoxide (O2●-, an ROS) is
significantly increased, 3) glutamine significantly increases cardiac ATP and reduces O2●-. Based on these
data, our overall hypothesis is that the deficiency of energy substrates and glutathione precursors during AKI
results in increased reactive oxygen species, reduced OXPHOS, reduced ATP production, and cardiac
dysfunction. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Determine the effect of AKI on cardiac energy metabolism via metabolic
flux analysis. Aim 2: Determine the mechanisms by which glutamine improves cardiac ATP production after
AKI, in vivo, with the hypothesis that glutamine will reduce cardiac O2●-, increase ATP production, and improve
mitochondrial and cardiac function. Aim 3: Determine the substrates of glutamine metabolism that improve
cardiac ATP production after AKI, ex vivo, with the hypothesis that metabolism to glutathione is the primary
mechanism of glutamine benefit. Since the complications of AKI have long been considered to be due to the
accumulation of metabolic wastes and other substances that may be removed by dialysis for patient benefit,
our overall hypothesis that substrate deficiency is a mechanisms of harm is a paradigm shift that challenges
one of the most fundamental notions in nephrology and will have wide ranging implications regarding the care
of patients with AKI, particularly regarding dialysis."
10817057,"The aim of this proposal is to optimize the design and materials and to perform
necessary pre-clinical testing of next-generation miniature, high-density multi-channel
connectors suitable for chronic implantation in a patient's body. These `HD Connectors' will be
part of systems that are used, for example, to treat disorders of the peripheral nervous system.
Maladies that could be treated in this way are problems with walking, such as after a stroke, and
restoring natural sensations in a phantom limb after amputation, among other examples.
 In this study, we will use custom-microfabricated, solid-filled connector bodies to
facilitate interconnections within and among long-lasting neural interfaces. Custom
encapsulation and assembly methods for the miniature connectors, developed with pilot
funding, will be optimized. Under this proposal, we will fabricate variants of new HD connectors
for mating with existing micro-neurostimulator designs. We will also evaluate the long-term
biocompatibility and bio-stability of these connectors through both benchtop experiments and
animal surgical trials. The data collected will then facilitate our application to the FDA to do
follow-on clinical studies of medical devices incorporating this HD connector technology.
 The relationship between the proposed effort and the patient care mission of the VA is
that these improvements are expected to increase the interchangeability of components of
implantable neurostimulation systems for rehabilitation that have high channel counts. This will
improve the safety and inter-operability of new devices under development, such as implantable
walking aids and devices for restoring natural sensation in amputated limbs."

While it has been recognized for decades that diseased cells arising from numerous disorders exhibit altered
iron metabolism compared to normal cells, only recently has it become apparent that increased concentration
of cytosolic free ferrous iron (Fe2+) - the labile iron pool (LIP) – is most associated with these pathologies.
Meanwhile, the overwhelming clinical success of the antimalarial artemisinin has established that LIP can be
safely exploited to treat diseases in humans (including children), a milestone that has inspired us and others to
develop 1,2,4-trioxolane (TRX)-based prodrugs that are activated by LIP and release drug payloads within
diseased cells. Although our knowledge of the role of LIP in normal physiology and disease has increased
substantially over the past 10 years, virtually all of our insights about LIP are founded on observations from cell
lines. Studying LIP in vivo is a major knowledge gap that is currently impeding efforts to apply experimental
LIP targeted therapies clinically. We hypothesized based on the well-studied mechanisms of TRX reactivity
with LIP that a PET strategy could enable LIP measurements in vivo by sequestering a radioisotope within
cells via Fe(II)-dependent protein crosslinking. We designed a prototype, 18F-TRX, and showed that its
biodistribution in vivo is Fe2+-dependent, it detects diverse cancer types with an expanded LIP, and tumor
uptake of 18F-TRX is directly proportional to tumor response to LIP targeting therapies. However, the tracer's
rapid serum clearance (t1/2 ~28 sec) and slow hepatobiliary clearance combine to limit the overall image
quality. Thus, the goal of this project is to test if a pre-targeting strategy involving macrodosing of a cold TRX
reagent, followed later by a microdose of a cognate 18F-click coupling partner may improve measurements of
LIP by eliminating the background signal from unreacted TRX and/or achieving better TRX exposure in tissues
with LIP expansion. During Aim 1, we will synthesize and study the in vivo pharmacology of TRX-
transcyclooctene (TCO) conjugates and fluoro-tetrazines to identify optimal biorthogonal click partners. During
Aim 2, the optimal pre-targeting conditions will be established in tumor bearing mice using immunoPET.
Imaging findings (e.g. tumor uptake, tumor to normal ratios) will be benchmarked against 18F-TRX and the 18F-
tetrazine alone. During Aim 3, we will perform cohort expansion studies to acquire additional biological
replicates while also studying spontaneous and orthotopic tumor models arising in abdominal tissues (e.g.
liver, pancreas) that we expect to be occult on 18F-TRX imaging. If successful, defining which disease types
harbor high LIP with PET provides a natural segue to clinical trials implementing the myriad experimental LIP
targeted therapies currently waiting in the queue. Solving this challenge with pre-targeting would also add a
new application for a venerable dosing strategy that could be broadly applied to improve the image quality of
other rapidly clearing small molecule radiotracers, or perhaps even the antitumor efficacy of radioligand
therapies."

Almost half of all people diagnosed with HIV in the United States are aged 50 or older, and they are at
increased risk for dementia and multimorbidity. Dementia is of major clinical policy concern because it results
in both inexorable clinical decline and extremely high costs of care. People with HIV are at particularly high risk
because they often have major risk factors for the development of traditional etiologies of dementia, such as
Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD), and they also have a risk of
HIV-associated neurocognitive disease (HAND) despite sustained virologic suppression. Depression,
cardiovascular disease (CVD), and HIV are known to have potent synergies that contribute to the development
of dementia. These comorbidities are modifiable risk factors for dementia that are highly prevalent, known to
be undertreated in people with HIV, and likely to be clinically and economically important targets for prevention
and management.
The overall goal of this proposal is to provide an evidence-based approach for prioritizing and advocating for
interventions to improve the quality of life and reduce morbidity and mortality among people aging with HIV.
The benefits of reducing the burden of depression and CVD among people with HIV may currently be
underestimated, given that concomitant benefits related to multimorbidity are often not captured due to short
durations of observational or trial data. Determining which interventions are most clinically effective and cost-
effective is critically important to understand so that people aging with HIV can benefit from strategies to
reduce their risk of dementia and multimorbidity as they age. We propose to: 1) develop the Cognitive
impairment, HIV, Aging, heaRt, MEntal health, and Dementia (CHARMED) Model, including populating the
model with clinical and outcomes data from the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and
Design (NA-ACCORD) and nationally-representative cost data; 2) project clinical and economic outcomes of
people aging with HIV; and 3) perform cost-effectiveness analyses of targeted interventions to reduce the
burden of depression and CVD and to quantify the resultant reduction in dementia and multimorbidity.
This proposal comprises a unique collaboration of experts in methods that are complementary and essential to
complete the research aims: clinical expertise, epidemiology of people aging with HIV, costing, simulation
modeling, and cost-effectiveness analysis. The proposed innovative multimorbidity model will be the first to
include these important comorbidities that are highly prevalent, demonstrate synergies that contribute to
dementia, and are amenable to treatment. The model structure and parameterization can both be revised with
the emergence of updated data and improved understanding of the synergies and pathophysiology. This
simulation modeling approach will allow for analyses of clinical and policy questions that aim to improve clinical
outcomes, improve quality of life, and reduce costs among people aging with HIV."

Resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs complicates the care and worsens the outcomes of individuals with
tuberculosis, the leading infectious cause of death worldwide. South Africa is using the new anti-tuberculosis
drug bedaquiline as part of both shorter and longer all-oral treatment regimens for patients with rifampicin-
resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB). While clinical trials and observational studies demonstrate improved treatment
outcomes with bedaquiline-based treatment, the predictors of poor treatment response (defined as positive
cultures two, four, or six months after diagnosis) and poor treatment outcomes are not well-characterized in
programmatic settings. Alarmingly, resistance to bedaquiline has been detected in clinical Mycobacterium
tuberculosis isolates. The background resistance to both new and old drugs that compose treatment regimens,
combined with observed variation in pretreatment phenotypic susceptibility to bedaquiline, raise concerns that
the risks of poor treatment response and outcomes may be higher than anticipated. To address these
concerns, we will use the robust infrastructure of the South African National Health Laboratory system and the
electronic drug-resistant tuberculosis register to assess programmatic poor treatment response among patients
with RR-TB in South Africa. We will perform minimum inhibitory concentration testing of bedaquiline and
companion drugs on routinely collected specimens in the Gauteng Province of South Africa to determine
whether elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations of bedaquiline in phenotypically bedaquiline-susceptible
pretreatment isolates are associated with poor treatment response or outcomes. Whole genome sequencing
on routinely collected specimens will allow simultaneous characterization of the underlying molecular
epidemiology of RR-TB. We will also use a novel approach of using the concentration of drugs with different
half-lives determined programmatically and pharmacokinetic modeling to evaluate association with time to
culture positivity and treatment outcomes. We will combine mycobacteriologic factors, drug concentration data,
and clinical data to develop a prediction model for poor treatment response and outcomes. Our findings will
guide targeted intervention strategies for individuals at high risk for poor treatment response, inform rapid drug
susceptibility tests that incorporate genotypic data for bedaquiline and companion drugs in new treatment
regimens of RR-TB, and explore the potential importance of measuring drug concentrations early in the course
of RR-TB treatment. The insights gained about genotypic and phenotypic variation in relation to treatment
outcomes of RR-TB will be highly valuable not only for South African tuberculosis programs, but also for high-
burden and under-resourced settings worldwide. Our study team includes globally recognized content experts
from South Africa and the US and will allow critical progress in drug-resistant TB research in South Africa."

Our goal is to identify how Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) signals at the human centromere to maintain genome
integrity. In mitosis, the kinetochore (KT) is assembled at the centromere and this complex is a major focus of
Plk1 activity. The KT is a 100 nm-structure assembled on the centromere that attaches chromosomes to the
mitotic spindle. Using super-resolution techniques, we have discovered that the bulk of Plk1 localizes to the
centromere, directly on chromatin >50 nm from the outer KT. Our long-term goal is to delineate Plk1 partners,
substrates, and timing of its activities to maintain faithful chromosome segregation. We are currently focused on
activities at the centromere, building on our key findings: Bloom Syndrome RecQ Helicase (BLM) directly or
indirectly mediates chromosome arm dislocation and centromere unwinding that occur with loss of Plk1 activity;
Plk1 regulates nascent transcripts on chromatin in mitosis and phosphorylates the N-terminus of Centromere
Protein C (CENP-C), both known to maintain KT integrity. Our central hypothesis is that a discrete centromere
pool of Plk1 stabilizes the mitotic centromere and operates through inactivating helicases, by supporting
transcription, and by maintaining CENP-C function. In Aim 1, we will map the spatial environments of Plk1 that
contribute to its functions along the KT-centromere axis. We will test the idea that a chromatin-localized pool of
Plk1 targets substrates and mediates activities separately from a KT-localized pool, to regulate faithful
chromosome segregation. Aim 2 will test how Plk1 dampens BLM helicase function to maintain centromere
integrity against mitotic pulling forces. To do this, we will identify Plk1 phosphorylation sites on the BLM protein,
determine the role of Plk1 on BLM localization, and evaluate how phosphorylation modulates its helicase
activities in biochemical assays and cells. Aim 3 will identify the role of Plk1 on CENP-C stabilization via direct
phosphorylation and transcriptional regulation. We have already mapped Plk1 phosphorylation sites on CENP-
C and have discovered that Plk1 regulates mitotic transcription. Towards this end, we will functionally analyze
the CENP-C phosphorylation events and identify the functional effect of Plk1 on RNA polymerases and mitotic
RNAs. Together, this work will reveal how Plk1 operates regionally in the KT to maintain genomic integrity."

There has been a continuous demand for development of insect control methods that are target-specific.
Juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroids (20-hydroxyecdysone, 20E is the most active form) are the major
hormones that regulate many physiological and developmental processes in insects. Since these hormones
are not present in vertebrates, they represent attractive targets for development of insect control methods.
Hindering this effort is the lack of understanding on the molecular basis of action of these hormones. There has
been excellent recent progress in understanding the molecular basis of 20E and JH action. Key players,
including receptors, co-activators, response elements and target genes involved in the action of these
hormones have been identified. Non-steroidal ecdysone agonists and JH analogs have been discovered, and
commercialized for the control of pests and disease vectors. Research supported by this program showed that
epigenetic modifications, especially acetylation levels of histones regulated by histone acetyltransferases
(HAT) and histone deacetylases (HDAC) modulate JH and 20E action. Hormone action requires multiple layers
of regulation because the same circulating levels of hormones exert diverse functions in different tissues and
under different physiological conditions. Based on the published literature and preliminary data included in this
application, we hypothesize that epigenetic regulators HDACs, HATs, histone lysine methyltransferases
(HKMT) and histone demethylases (HDM) modulate JH and 20E action in the regulation of postembryonic
development and reproduction. The main goal of this proposal to test this hypothesis by studying the
mechanisms of action of epigenetic modifiers in JH and 20E action using T. castaneum, TcA cells, Ae. aegypti
and Aag2 cells as model systems. The two Specific Aims of the proposal are 1. To identify and characterize
epigenetic modifiers required for 20E and JH regulation of postembryonic development and female
reproduction and 2. To study mechanisms of action of epigenetic modifiers required for 20E and JH regulation
of postembryonic development and female reproduction. In the first Specific Aim, RNAi, CRISPR/Cas9
genome editing methods, RNA sequencing, bioinformatics, RT-qPCR, enzyme assays and cell culture
approaches will be used to identify and characterize HATs, HDACs, HKMTs and HDMs required for
postembryonic development and female reproduction in T. castaneum and Ae. aegypti. In the second Specific
Aim, the mechanisms of action of 10-12 epigenetic modifiers will be studied using western blots and ChIP,
reporter, Two-hybrid and pull-down assays, and mass spectrometry approaches. Results from the proposed
research will impact medicine by providing information for the development of vector control methods. This
information could help in understanding epigenetics of human diseases such as cancer. The results from the
proposed research may help to transform our understanding of endocrinology of disease vectors."
10811732,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Emerging viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have
devastated the world. We are desperately in need of broadly acting antivirals that can curb the spread of the
next emerging virus. However, a major knowledge gap exists due to our incomplete understanding of the cellular
pathways that control or facilitate viral replication.
 Type I interferon (IFN) is the principal host innate immune response to viral infection and regulates the
expression of an array of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is one of the most
potent ISGs that blocks the replication of diverse RNA and DNA viruses. ZAP attenuates alphavirus production
by up to 8 logs and is indispensable for IFN efficacy against alphaviruses. Moreover, increased virulence of
human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and SARS-CoV-2 associates with viral evasion from ZAP recognition.
Importantly, highly pathogenic alphaviruses such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV) have developed resistance to
ZAP, highlighting ZAP as a critical driver of viral pathogenesis. ZAP is proposed to act through viral translational
inhibition (alphavirus and flavivirus) and viral RNA degradation (other viruses), however, how ZAP blocks viral
replication and how viruses evade from ZAP recognition are still poorly understood.
 We recently made two important advances towards this goal: First, we showed that ZAP viral translational
inhibition requires the host factor TRIM25, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. TRIM25-mediated ZAP antiviral mechanism is
innovative, and independent of RIG-I, IRF3, and IFN. Using a novel “substrate trapping” approach we have now
identified numerous cellular proteins with exciting roles in translation and RNA processes to be TRIM25
interactors and potential substrates. These preliminary findings connect the ubiquitination process to viral
translational suppression by ZAP for the first time and provide cellular targets for antiviral therapy. Second, we
identified differences in alphavirus sensitivity to ZAP. Highly virulent alphaviruses such as CHIKV that have
infected millions of people in recent epidemics can evade from or counteract ZAP recognition through their viral
non-structural gene region. Discovery of viral strategies for evasion and antagonism will identify druggable viral
targets and inform development of vaccine strains with weakened ability to counteract ZAP.
 Taken together, our results have led us to hypothesize that ZAP recruits TRIM25 to ubiquitinate and
modulate cellular factors leading to viral translational inhibition, and highly pathogenic alphaviruses have evolved
strategies to escape and/or antagonize ZAP antiviral activity. We propose to elucidate the mechanism of
TRIM25-mediated ZAP translational inhibition (Aim 1) and determine the mechanisms of viral resistance to ZAP
(Aim 2). Success of these Aims will advance our understanding of how the IFN pathway co-opts cellular
processes to block viral replication and drive viral pathogenesis, and provide promising host and viral targets for
therapeutic intervention of alphavirus and other virus infections."
10793539,"Background. Young transgender women (YTW) have the highest HIV prevalence/incidence than any other
risk group in the U.S. The repeated exposure to gender minority stigma compounded by the psychosocial
challenges associated with social disadvantage and economic marginalization exacerbates disparities in HIV
incidence and invalidates YTW’s gender identity. This can lead to behaviors (e.g., substance use, sex work,
healthcare avoidance) that potentiate HIV acquisition risk. In order to decrease HIV incidence among YTW, an
intervention needs to 1) address HIV risk as part of YTW’s life contexts; 2) be accessible and far-reaching such
that the entire at-risk population can participate (e.g., rural areas) during a time most convenient for them; and
3) be highly sustainable with low associated costs to implement in real-world settings. Preliminary Research.
The current proposal is a culmination of over 10 years of research with this population, which included: 1)
developing and pilot testing an empowerment-based, group-delivered (in person) HIV prevention intervention
for YTW ages 16-29, called Project LifeSkills; 2) conducting a full-scale, multisite randomized controlled trial
(RCT) of Project LifeSkills (NIMH R01; MPIs: Garofalo/Mimiaga), where we demonstrated the efficacy of this
intervention to reduce HIV risk (note: Project LifeSkills is currently the only “best evidence” HIV risk reduction
intervention for YTW included among the CDC’s compendium of evidence-based interventions); 3) adapting
the face-to-face version of Project LifeSkills to an online-delivered, mobile app platform (containing 4 online
modules) via an NIMH-funded R56 (MPIs: Kuhns, Mimiaga), called “LifeSkills Mobile”; and 4) completing an
iterative usability pilot trial of the LifeSkills Mobile app to enhance participant acceptability/feasibility of study
procedures and conducted exit interviews to evaluate the app’s look, feel, and functional components.
Conceptual Model. LifeSkills Mobile is an mHealth intervention to promote biobehavioral HIV prevention
strategies based on empowerment theory and was developed using a community-based participatory research
approach. Overview of Study Design. We propose to conduct an RCT to assess the efficacy of the LifeSkills
Mobile intervention in comparison to a standard of care (SOC) condition among 5,000 YTW recruited online.
The primary outcome is reduction in incident HIV infections; a secondary outcome is total condomless anal/
vaginal sex acts occurring in the context of insufficient PrEP protection. At baseline and every 6 months
through 48 months, enrolled participants will complete an online survey sent via a link to their mobile phone
and will be mailed an OraQuick In-Home HIV Test kit . We will also estimate the total and incremental costs of
the LifeSkills Mobile intervention relative to SOC, from healthcare sector and societal perspectives. Real
World Applicability. Given inherent limitations to widespread dissemination of face-to-face, group-based
interventions, LifeSkills Mobile extends the potential reach of the intervention via the development of a mobile
version, and provides content on, and access to, current biobehavioral prevention technologies (e.g., PrEP)."
10774315,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
How does the human visual system regulate competing sensory information? Prevailing theories propose that
a computation known as divisive normalization plays a key role in governing neural competition. Normalization
is considered a canonical neural computation, potentially driving responses throughout the brain. Interestingly,
there is evidence to suggest that normalization’s pervasive role relies on an exquisite tuning to stimulus
features, such as orientation and spatial frequency, but this feature-selective nature of normalization is
surprisingly understudied, particularly in humans. Our long-term goal is to understand the neural mechanisms
supporting vision across the visual hierarchy in humans, and to characterize how they flexibly change with
selective attention. The aim of this proposal is to employ state-of-the-art functional neuroimaging techniques
and analyses to shed light on the tuning characteristics that allow normalization to control population
responses within human visual cortex, and to understand how normalization can support selective attention.
We approach the problem by first characterizing the selective properties of normalization within early visual
cortex during normal, passive, scene viewing. We will then assess the unifying potential of models based on
divisive normalization, examining the role that normalization plays in regulating competition via spatially-
directed and feature-based attention. By revealing the role played by tuned normalization within human visual
cortex, these studies will provide the necessary framework for the development of diagnostic tools and
treatments for clinical disorders that involve deficits in central visual processing."

Chronic pain is a highly prevalent and impactful condition. It persists past the time expected for normal tissue
healing from an acutely painful event, suggesting plasticity is occurring within the central nervous system to
perpetuate the pain experience. Furthermore, there are several conditions known to occur in the absence of
any tissue injury, such as fibromyalgia and tension-type headaches. Collectively, these conditions are referred
to as nociplastic pain syndromes. The broad goal of this proposal is to identify regions within the central
nervous system that exhibit plasticity in response to chronic pain. To model chronic pain, I will employ the
partial sciatic nerve ligation (pSNL). I will focus my investigation on the parabrachial nucleus (PBN), a hub for
the relay of aversive sensory information. My preliminary data suggests that the population of neurons
expressing Calca within the PBN exhibits an increase in neuronal activity acutely following chronic pain
induction, however this activity does not persist through the entire chronic pain experience. Additionally,
silencing the PBN Calca population prevents pSNL driven pain and chronically stimulating this population
produces pain that persists beyond stimulus cessation. Together this information informs my central hypothesis
that PBN Calca neurons are involved in the initiation and perpetuation of chronic pain. To test this hypothesis, I
will both manipulate Calca neurons and observe their activity during chronic pain. The experiments detailed in
Aim 1 will probe whether PBN Calca neurons are involved in maintaining the chronic pain experience by
assessing whether transient inhibition of PBN Calca neurons will ameliorate pSNL driven pain. Aim 2 will
explore how much and what type of stimulation is required for the manifestation of persistent pain driven by
PBN Calca neurons. This aim will also determine whether expression of the Calca gene is required for the
manifestation of chronic pain. Finally, in Aim 3 I will observe the activity of PBN Calca neurons preceding and
following the induction of chronic pain via calcium imaging. This will reveal when PBN Calca neurons exhibit
increased activity during a chronic pain experience. Collectively, these experiments will delineate the role
Calca neurons play in the manifestation and perpetuation of chronic pain. This work will further our
understanding of how chronic pain conditions arise and persist in the absence of a driving injury and may
suggest a target for novel pain therapies."

The proposed grant is an approved ancillary study to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension for
Diabetes Trial (DASH4D), a randomized clinical trial being conducted at Johns Hopkins University. The
overarching goal of this ancillary study is to evaluate how a controlled diet (as part of this feeding study)
modifies glucose control and glycemic variability in black and white adults with type 2 diabetes. The objective
of the DASH4D trial is to determine the effects, alone and combined, of (a) the DASH4D diet (a DASH-style
diet modified for people with type 2 diabetes) vs. comparison diet typical of what many Americans eat and (b)
lower sodium intake vs. higher sodium intake on blood pressure among people with type 2 diabetes and
elevated blood pressure. The core design is a single-site, 4-period, crossover feeding study with 5-week
periods. Participants will be fed each of four isocaloric diets in random order. The proposed ancillary study will
add continuous glucose monitoring and laboratory testing of complementary biomarkers in all participants in
the DASH4D trial during two weeks of each of the four feeding periods. Our overarching goal is to answer the
question: Does a diet rich in fruits and vegetables improve glucose control and reduce glycemic variability in
adults with type 2 diabetes?"

Health disparities persist in the U.S. with underserved populations suffering lower quality of care and worse
outcomes. National leaders in medicine have called for widespread efforts to recruit and train
underrepresented minorities in medicine (URM) to supply the physician workforce and who can serve
underserved communities. Although the recruitment of URM medical students is increasing, their retention in
the physician profession is less certain. For URM resident physicians, Graduate Medical Education (GME)
learning environment factors that perpetuate biases due to race/ethnicity and gender have high potential to
hinder their professional development and retention in medicine. These include required assessments on
residents subjected to assessment bias within their training programs. Little is known nationally about the GME
learning environment factors associated with URM physician assessment bias, particularly in their key
formative years as residents and prior to becoming fully licensed physicians. Our overarching goal is to
investigate the GME learning environment factors impacting the assessment of resident physicians training in
primary care. The primary objective is to identify and test modifiable factors among URM resident physicians
training in all family medicine and internal medicine GME programs using an integrated, multilevel dataset
sourced from national bodies. Our hypotheses center on a multilevel conceptual model and preliminary data
that includes the representation of URM and gender in the GME learning environment, and how program-
related factors may impact the assessments of residents. Using multiple logistic regression and multi-level
growth curve modeling, we will examine the degree to which URM representation, gender, and program factors
are associated with assessment bias, and how these factors may impact the trajectory of measurements of
resident learning in Accreditation Council of GME (ACGME) physician competencies for all U.S. residents
training in accredited family medicine and internal medicine programs. The specific aims for this study are 1)
examine whether assessment inequities for URM and women residents in the ACGME Milestone assessments
are associated with representation of URM and women faculty, and 2) examine how measurements of learning
trajectories for URM and women residents in the ACGME Milestone assessment ratings are associated with
program factors. We have assembled a team of experts in medical education assessment, workforce diversity,
medical education policy, and analytics, and expect our outcomes to inform national leaders in medical
education and primary care physician workforce planning to better support URM physicians training in GME.
This study also meets current demands to investigate the structural barriers that limit primary care physician
workforce diversity and will align with the NIH Health Disparities Strategic Plan’s commitment to improving
minority health and address their disparities."

10720883,"The PI is an expert in cytotoxic (apoptotic) DNases, DNA endonucleases. Despite their “apoptotic”
name, these enzymes are responsible for final and irreversible cell death of any mechanism after
a tissue injury including drug effects, diseases, or traumas. DNases kill cells by fragmenting their
DNA after injury. The PI’s team identifies the endonucleases that participate in premortem DNA
fragmentation in kidney tubular epithelium during toxic (cisplatin, glycerol) or hypoxic acute renal
failure, toxic liver injury (acetaminophen, alcohol, carbon nanotubes), total body gamma
irradiation, and in breast, prostate, or melanoma cancer cells during cell death induced by
anticancer drugs (docetaxel, etoposide, camptothecin, cisplatin, cyclophosplamide, and newly
developed anticancer agents). These findings strongly indicate that the inhibition or inactivation
of two most active endonucleases, DNase I or EndoG, is protective against cell death in various
models of injury and toxicity. The group also has evidence that these enzymes belong to
previously unknown network, which communicate through DNA breaks, and in which an activation
of one endonuclease may lead to activation of the entire network, followed by DNA fragmentation
and irreversible cell death. First pharmacologically sound, non-toxic endonuclease inhibitors
developed by the team have a great promise as potentially universal cytoprotective drugs
applicable for modulation of cell death during human diseases, including organ failures, cancer
and atherosclerosis, as well as side effects of drugs. The PI’s studies are published in highly-
rated journals including Journal of American Society of Nephrology, European Heart J, Nature
Communications, Hepatology, Atherosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology, Kidney
International, Cell Death and Differentiation, American Journal of Physiology, Scientific Reports,
Human Molecular Genetics, and others. These studies are highly relevant to the VA healthcare
because organ injuries are common in Veterans, military personnel and elderly. The studies of
endonuclease inhibitors have a promise of being universal non-toxic protective agents of acute
organ injuries of various kinds, which could be applied both during military operations and to
ameliorate organ injuries induced by diseases in Veterans. Therefore, the results of the studies
led by the PI may eventually save human lives, improve the health and wellbeing of Veterans,
and decrease the number of disabilities among Veterans and in the general population."

Coronary atherosclerosis is one of five top causes for cardiovascular (CV) hospitalization in U.S. Veterans.
Atherosclerosis is a complex and progressive disease characterized by the buildup of plaques composed of lipid-
rich foam cells, inflammatory cells, and fibrous elements in the arterial intima. Atherosclerosis is associated with
high risks of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke, which are the additional three of top five causes
for Veterans cardiovascular hospitalization. It is well established that vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) and
nuclear factor (NF)-kB signaling contribute to development and progression of atherosclerosis. However, the
factors and mechanisms that govern SMC function in atherosclerosis, remain largely unknown. Our exciting
preliminary data indicate that Olfactomedin 2 (Olfm2) plays an essential role in the development of
atherosclerosis. Olfm2 is induced in lipid-loading SMCs during SMC foam cell formation and in mouse and
human atherosclerotic lesions. Importantly, Olfm2 deficiency (Olfm2-/-) inhibits high fat diet-induced
atherosclerotic plaque formation and improves plaque stability in advanced atherosclerosis. Biochemically,
Olfm2-/- elevates serum level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol while downregulates the expression of acyl-
coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT1) in aortas of ApoE-/- mice. ACAT1 converts free cholesterol
into cholesteryl esters for storage in lipid droplets and thus promotes foam cell formation in atherosclerotic lesion.
In vitro studies showed that knockdown of Olfm2 inhibits while overexpression of Olfm2 promotes lipid
accumulation and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) expression in oxidized low-
density lipoprotein-treated SMCs. These data strongly support a novel hypothesis that Olfm2 promotes
atherosclerosis by mediating SMC foam cell formation and apoptosis. Using primary human coronary artery
SMCs, Olfm2-/- mouse SMCs, and SMC lineage-tracing Olfm2-/- mice combining with molecular, cellular,
histological, and pharmacological approaches, we will 1) test if Olfm2 promotes SMC foam cell formation and
mediates SMC foam cell apoptosis; 2) determine the molecular mechanisms underlying Olfm2 function in
mediating SMC foam cell formation and apoptosis; and 3) determine the cell-specific roles of Olfm2 in
atherosclerosis in vivo. Successful Completion of the proposed studies will unravel a novel mechanism
underlying Olfm2 function in atherogenesis, which may ultimately lead to the development of therapeutic
strategies against atherosclerosis in Veterans and general populations."

equity, and inclusion programming to enhance and sustain a culture of diversity and inclusive excellence.
 We are confident that our decades of collaboration combined with our current adeptness to interact
virtually will allow us to provide the support and integration our Benjamin-Carver Scientists need to be
successful. Together we can create the systemic and sustainable culture change needed to ameliorate our
region’s significant health disparities."
10927376,"The overall goal of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)/Tuskegee University (TU) Faculty
Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) Partnership is to capitalize on the
complementary strengths of both partners to create systemic and sustainable cultural change to further support
inclusive excellence at both institutions. The goal of the Evaluation Core is to clearly and objectively
demonstrate the impact and effectiveness of UAB/TU FIRST Partnership activities as well as collaborate with
the FIRST Coordination and Evaluation Center (CEC) and other funded grantees to identify and harmonize a
set of common data elements informing the transformation of “culture at NIH-funded extramural institutions by
building self-reinforcing community of scientist committed to diversity and inclusive excellence.”
 Given the complexity of this initiative, the evaluation will be conducted by two Co-Leads with extensive
experience in the evaluation of large collaborative initiatives. They will bring this history and a successful
integrated approach to assess achievement of programmatic goals. The specific aims of the Evaluation Core
are: 1) to conduct ongoing process evaluations to track the UAB/TU FIRST Partnership activities; 2) to conduct
impact and outcome evaluations to assure that the immediate and long-term goals and specific aims of the
UAB/TU FIRST Partnership are being met and to test whether the program achieves significant improvements
in metrics of institutional culture and diversity; and 3) to collaborate with the FIRST CEC and other funded
grantees to identify metrics, harmonize a set of common data elements, and provide data for evaluation of the
FIRST Cohort program.
 The UAB/TU FIRST Partnership will utilize the Logic Model and its inputs, outputs and outcomes to
assess progress. For our program, steps of the Logic Model translate into the following chain of activities:
1) strengthening of the existing collaborative UAB/TU relationships; 2) strengthening the institutional climate of
diversity and inclusive excellence at both institutions; 3) implementation of practices and policies that support
sustainable cultural change, including the establishment of an Office of Integrated Research Support and
Research Navigators; 4) recruitment of clusters of Benjamin-Carver Scientists who are committed to advancing
diversity, equity, and inclusion; 5) provision of support for Benjamin-Carver Scientists; 6) development of a
plan for sustainability of the program; 7) decreasing isolation, increasing community building, and fostering
development of new faculty, which, in turn, will lead to: 8) faculty retention; 9) an increase in productivity in
terms scholarly activities (grants and publications); 10) an increase in collaboration (e.g., development of new
multi-PI investigations, cluster faculty engaging non-cluster faculty, collaborations with communities); and
ultimately, 11) an increase in impact through the establishment of an effective model of systemic and
sustainable cultural change that can serve as a model for all of UAB, TU, and other universities."

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the global
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying the adaptive immune
response to SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for predicting vaccine efficacy and assessing the risk of reinfection.
Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have been studied extensively and are clearly protective, but may
be short-lived and are not elicited in all infected individuals. Mounting evidence indicates that T cells play a vital
role in the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and in formation of long-term memory responses to this virus. Extensive
structural information is now available on neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent patients (CPs)
bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer or RBD (>330 PDB entries), resulting in a comprehensive picture of the
B cell response to this virus. By contrast, very little structural information is available for SARS-CoV-2-specific
TCRs bound to their peptide–MHC (pMHC) targets (4 PDB entries), despite the increasingly appreciated role of
T cell-mediated immunity in combatting COVID-19. Our goal is to address this major unmet need by obtaining
atomic-level information on SARS-CoV-2 recognition by MHC class I-restricted TCRs from COVID-19 CPs. We
will focus on CD8+ T cell epitopes because cytotoxic CD8+ T cells participate directly in viral clearance. Our
Specific Aims are:
 Aim 1: Determine crystal structures of TCR–pMHC complexes. We will target for X-ray
crystallographic analysis TCRs specific for epitopes that elicit high levels of TCR expansion in COVID-19 CPs,
as well as TCRs associated with protection. To demonstrate feasibility, we have already determined structures
of a public and a private TCR from COVID-19 CPs in complex with HLA-A2 and two SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)
epitopes, YLQ and RLQ. We will extend these studies to three additional S epitopes (FVF, FQF, RLN) and three
nucleocapsid (N) epitopes (LLL, LQL, SPR), which elicit strong T cell responses, and are presented by HLA-A2
or HLA-B7 MHCs. We have diverse panels of TCRs targeting each of these CD8+ T cell epitopes.
 Aim 2: Analysis of TCR–pMHC structures. TCR–pMHC complex structures determined in Aim 1 will
be analyzed using advanced computational structural biology tools to delineate key features of their recognition,
as well as the predicted targeting of epitope variants from SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses.
 These studies will yield foundational knowledge about TCR recognition of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, about
the generation of clonal diversity in epitope-specific TCR repertoires, and about the ways mutations in these
epitopes may enable the virus to escape immune surveillance."
10900560,"SUMMARY
The larger goal of the project is to identify infection-dependent weaknesses of Gram-negative bacterial
pathogens that could be exploited chemically. We focus on the human pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and its survival within mammalian cells and use cell culture infection models
and small molecules as tools. We and others have observed that some small molecules that are not effective
against Gram-negative bacteria in media prevent pathogen survival during infection of cells and animals.
Gram-negative bacteria likely become vulnerable during infection to small molecules because a variety of host
innate immune mechanisms permeabilize the bacterial cell envelope and/or occupy efflux pumps, enabling
compounds to reach a periplasmic or cellular target. When laboratory media imitates host innate immunity by
permeabilizing the outer membrane, these compounds inhibit bacterial growth. We have identified small
molecules that under broth conditions that permeabilize the outer membrane or in protoplasts, dissipate
bacterial inner membrane voltage without physically disrupting the lipid bilayer. Membrane voltage disruption
could compromise bacteria by, for instance, interfering with energy production and/or activating stress-
response signaling. The compounds do not disrupt mammalian membranes at concentrations that kill S.
Typhimurium in macrophages and at least one of the compounds reduces tissue colonization in mice,
demonstrating in vivo potential for this approach. The Specific Aims will interrogate five distinct molecule
classes to determine whether targeting the inner membrane should be pursued as a novel approach to fighting
Gram-negative bacterial infections."

The over-arching goal of the Washington University (WU) StARR Program in Cross-Disciplinary Oncology
Clinician Scientist Training is to IDENTIFY, RECRUIT, TRAIN, RETAIN, and ADVANCE outstanding physicians
in oncology-focused graduate medical education (GME) training (i.e. “residency”) for careers as clinician-
investigators. We have proposed training clinician resident-investigators from diverse, oncology-focused
disciplines and residency training programs.
Long-term objectives: The WU NCI R38 StARR program will successfully identify, recruit, and train oncology-
focused clinicians with an interest in becoming clinician-scientists during their residency training. These trainees
would then be eligible for subsequent career-development awards, including the companion K38 mechanism.
Our program plan includes continued long-term follow-up and engagement of R38 trainees to retain and advance
their careers as physician-scientists.
Key Elements of Training: An emphasis of our proposal includes multiple levels of career development, including
co-mentoring by at least two mentors in different departments to encourage cross-disciplinary training and
collaboration. Each resident-investigator will also have a mentoring committee and report regularly to the PI and
Advisory Committee. A structured curriculum with specific competencies and milestones will be established to
best train individual resident-investigators in programs and research programs that are ideally matched with their
skills, interests, and career development. We have received broad support from all levels of research and
education at WU, including the Dean’s Office and the participating Departments and Programs.
Research Projects: The WU NCI R38 StARR program will support up to four resident-investigators per year
from the participating departments. Each resident-investigator will engage in 1-2 years of dedicated, protected
research time, free from all clinical responsibilities. They will craft a research plan commensurate with their
interests and prior experiences that may involve further training, coursework, workshops, and career
development. Specific metrics and plans for follow-up, evaluation, and long-term mentoring and career
development are included in our proposal.
The WU StARR Program in Cross-Disciplinary Oncology Clinician Scientist Training will leverage the significant
institutional, departmental, and programmatic resources at our University to meet the stated goal of the StARR
program to recruit and retain outstanding health professionals to foster their careers as clinician-investigators."
10735899,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lipomannan (LM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) are mycobacterial lipoglycans that are critical for Mycobacte-
rium tuberculosis to establish infection. These lipoglycans are synthesized in the plasma membrane and
trafficked to the cell surface. LM and LAM are widely conserved among mycobacteria, and therefore must also
play a fundamental role in the physiology of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic mycobacterial species. However,
it remains obscure how their biosynthesis is coordinated with other cell envelope biosyntheses and how they
contribute to the integrity of the cell envelope. The long-term goal is to determine the role of lipoglycans in my-
cobacterial physiology and identify vulnerabilities in the process of creating and maintaining the cell envelope
structure. As the next step, the objective of this proposal is to gain fundamental insights into the role of lipogly-
cans in cell envelope integrity in Mycobacterium smegmatis and M. tuberculosis. The central hypothesis is that
LM/LAM biosynthesis, in coordination with peptidoglycan and capsular a-glucan biosyntheses, positively con-
tributes to glycan homeostasis, ensuring the plasticity and integrity of cell surface structure during active growth.
The rationale is that finding vulnerabilities in the regulatory process that coordinates the glycan biosyntheses will
lay the foundation for cell envelope-targeting antimicrobial development. Guided by published and preliminary
data from the applicant’s laboratory, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two aims: 1) Identify the role of
LM/LAM biosynthesis in suppressing peptidoglycan degradation; and 2) Determine the role of the capsular layer
in maintaining cell envelope integrity. In the first aim, the hypothesis that the cell shape of a LAM-deficient mutant
deforms due to the weakened cell wall will be tested. The potential molecular mechanism of LAM suppressing
peptidoglycan hydrolases will be examined. In the second aim, the hypothesis that the morphological defect of
the LAM-deficient mutant can be overcome by activating the SenX3-RegX3 two-component system and increas-
ing the production of a-glucan will be examined. The proposed research is innovative because it reveals a new
role of mycobacterial lipoglycans in maintaining glycan homeostasis, and because it combines the synergistic
expertise of the applicant and his collaborators in forward genetics and bioorthogonal metabolic labeling of cell
wall biosynthesis, a substantive departure from the status quo in both concept and execution. The proposed
research is significant because the data obtained here will form the foundation for developing drugs that could
kill M. tuberculosis by targeting a regulatory mechanism of mycobacterial cell envelope homeostasis. Such a
drug may also make the cell envelope more permeable to other antimicrobials."

The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) increases in females with aging and falling estrogen (E2) levels
during menopause, yet the beneficial effects of postmenopausal hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) on
reducing the risk remain controversial. Estrogen mediates its protective effects by inducing its receptor ERα
binding to E2-target genes. Dysregulation of epigenetic enzymes like histone deacetylases (HDACs) are
implicated in pathological aging and class I HDAC2 functions as a positive regulator of cardiac hypertrophy
(CH) in response to stress. The long-term research goal is to contribute toward the development of clinically
useful mechanism-based interventions to treating or preventing CVD in postmenopausal aging females. The
overall objective for this R03 application is to establish proof of concept of age dependent E2/ERα signaling
regulating HDAC2 expression in heart under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. The central
hypothesis is that endogenous E2/ERα signaling is cardioprotective through the inhibition of HDAC2
expression in premenopausal females. The rationale underlying this project is that proof of concept of age-
dependent E2/ERα-mediated repression of HDAC2 expression and cardio protection will enable subsequent
definitive R01 studies aimed at designing strategies to treat or prevent heart diseases in aging females. The
central hypothesis will be examined with 2 Specific Aims: 1) Identify age-dependent effects of E2/ER alpha
on cardiac HDAC2 expression. Under this aim a) cultured human CM (HCM) isolated from normal male, pre
and postmenopausal female ventricular heart tissue will be utilized to establish transcriptional repression of
HDAC2 gene via actions of E2/ERα and (b) young and old female and male mice heart tissues will be
utilized to determine age- and sex-dependent regulation of cardiac ERs and HDAC2 gene expression and
activity by novel Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR), molecular and biochemical techniques. 2) Determine the
functional consequences of ovariectomy and E2 on cardiac function and regulation of HDAC2
expression/activity. In this aim, effects of E2 on HDAC2 repression will be studied in drug–induced CH in
ovariectomized (young and aged) female mice by utilizing echocardiography, systolic blood pressure
measurements, ELISA, histology, and gene expression studies. The research proposed in this application is
innovative in the applicant's opinion, because it utilizes new ddPCR technique and studies a novel
regulatory mechanism of E2/ERα-mediated HDAC2 repression at the transcription level in heart. This will
lead to define new E2/ERα transcriptional target and its functional role in the heart of young and aging
females. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide strong scientific justification
for the continued research and development of combinatorial drug with E2 for aging females."

Studies have shown that up to 80% of cancer patients reported using botanical dietary supplements (BDS)
following their initial cancer diagnoses. BDS have been found to be consumed more by cancer patients than
otherwise healthier patients without cancer to alleviate side effects of chemotherapy drugs and/or increase
quality of life. Upon examination of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System
database, our research team found an indicated potential risk between CYP3A4 non-interactive anticancer drugs
and BDS containing Euterpe oleracea Mart. (açaí), which included an increased risk for cardiovascular adverse
events when taken together. However, the mechanism of this interaction remains unknown. The popularity of
açaí containing products continues to grow and, now in 2022, açaí is among the top 40 botanicals used in the
United States. Based on a cross-examination of the literature, we hypothesize that hepatic UDP-
glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are the target in which inhibition by compounds in açaí could promote
cardiovascular adverse events when taken with anticancer drugs. This proposal will identify extracts of açaí
containing UGT inhibitors and test our newly automated Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking
(GNPS) coupled to Bioactivity tool for elucidation of inhibitory compounds. Specific Aim 1A: Generate UGT
inhibition assays to elucidate the potential for chemical constituents in açaí extract for inhibition of UGT enzymes.
Extracts will be tested for inhibition of UGT isoforms 1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, and 2B7 using recombinant
human UGTs generated from baculovirus-transfected insect cells. Specific Aim 1B: LC-MS/MS chemical
fingerprints of açaí extracts will be used to form Bioactive Molecular Networks (BMN) using our automated
GNPS-Bioactivity dashboard to predict inhibitors of UGTs. Commercially available compounds predicted from
this tool will be purchased and verified before testing in isolation for UGT inhibition. The result of this project will
be a potential mechanism by which constituents of BDS containing açaí are causing BDS-anticancer drug
interactions that are clinically relevant for the treatment of cancer."

As an increasing percentage of preterm infants survive worldwide, the number of infants at risk for retinopathy
of prematurity (ROP) is increasing. These infants are also at high risk for future abnormal visual function and
neurodevelopment. While current screening approaches address identifying eyes for treatment of severe ROP,
there are no attempts to address the later subnormal vision of many preterm infants. In part, this is due to a lack
of information about the retina beyond that of retinal vascular development. In addition, the most common
method to screen for ROP remains indirect ophthalmoscopic examination by physicians with annotated drawings
for documentation, a method proven to be poorly reproducible and stressful to the fragile infant. Bedside retinal
photographs enable documentation and the possibility for telemedicine approaches, but lack information about
retinal microanatomy, are poor quality in darkly pigmented eyes and also are stressful to the infant because of
the required light exposure. We need an infant-friendly, more practical approach to evaluate ROP efficiently and
additional information about ocular and neurovascular development that could lead to improved clinical care.
This research builds on our group’s ability to reliably capture and process non-contact, infrared optical coherence
tomography (OCT) and OCT-angiography of retinal microanatomy and microvasculature at high speed, across
a wide field of view, and at the bedside in preterm infants. Our overall objectives are threefold: first, to evaluate
infant microanatomy and microvascular flow findings relevant to vision and neurodevelopmental outcomes in
children; second, to translate and test our imaging achievements for real-world use by nurses at the bedside and
better clinical insight and feedback; and third, to gather additional data in eyes that progress to treatment and
dive deeper into the insight that they provide into pathways of disease in ROP. The investigational OCT imaging
will be used in this research to gather information that is otherwise not accessible to the physician. This research
will lay the groundwork for future use of infant OCT markers to guide care."

The overarching goal of this Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award (K01) is to provide Dr.
Ruschelle Leone with the training and research activities needed to become an independent investigator. Her
program of research will focus on developing and evaluating innovative integrated programs for heavy episodic
drinking, cannabis use, and sexual assault. Research estimates 1 in 5 college women experiences sexual assault.
Alcohol, cannabis, and sexual assault victimization have a reciprocal association; alcohol and cannabis are known
risk factors for sexual assault, and women who experience sexual assault are at an increased risk of developing
alcohol and cannabis use disorders. Although prevention efforts targeting potential perpetrators and bystanders
is critical, these programs have yet to demonstrate reductions in rates of sexual assault victimization or
perpetration. As part of comprehensive sexual assault programming, feminist scholars have called for the use of
risk reduction programs to empower women by increasing a woman's ability to recognize and resist sexual
assault by providing skills to avoid, interpret, and resist sexual assault. However, these programs have yet to
directly target alcohol and cannabis use within an integrated framework. This innovative proposal includes
training activities to ensure that Dr. Leone achieves the following four new career goals: 1) Develop expertise in
reducing alcohol misuse, cannabis use, and sexual assault; 2) Receive training in the development and testing of
integrated interventions for alcohol misuse, cannabis use, and sexual assault victimization; 3) Obtain advanced
training in multilevel and longitudinal data analyses; and 4) Hone skills in grant-writing, responsible conduct of
research, and professional development. The mentorship team includes expert psychologists, physicians, and
public health scientists in the following areas: development of web-based interventions for alcohol and sexual
assault (Gilmore), treatments for alcohol and cannabis use (Gray), social norm interventions for alcohol and
cannabis prevention (Neighbors), sexual assault risk reduction programs (Senn), qualitative methods for
intervention development (Salazar), design and analysis of clinical trials (Hayat), and program implementation
(Self-Brown). Dr. Leone will apply the skills acquired during the training activities to a research project focused
on the development of an integrated program for heavy episodic drinking, cannabis use, and sexual assault risk
reduction. The research project includes mixed-methods research to develop program content, assess the
usability and acceptability with college women who engaging in heavy episodic drinking and cannabis use, and
conduct a feasibility randomized controlled trial. This project will establish feasibility of conducting a larger
randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy of the integrated program. The proposed training and research
activities will prepare Dr. Leone for an independent research career focused on the development and evaluation
innovative integrated programs for heavy episodic drinking, cannabis use, and sexual assault. This project is
directly in line with several NIH priorities and will inform a R-level grant to conduct a randomized clinical trial."

Natural products (particularly botanical dietary supplements) are a billion-dollar industry in the US and continue
to serve as an important source for the development of new therapeutics. Trained biomedical researchers are
needed to evaluate the chemical composition, activity, and mechanism of action of medicinally used natural
products. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) recognizes this need in
their 2016 Strategic Plan, with the stated goal to “support research training and career development
opportunities to increase the number and quality of scientists trained to conduct rigorous, cutting-edge
research on complementary and integrative health practices.” The University of North Carolina at Greensboro
(UNCG) is a unique and ideal location for such training to occur. Our PhD program in Medicinal Biochemistry
emphasizes natural products and integrative medicine research, and we have a strong collaborative network of
faculty mentors with relevant research programs. UNCG participates in two major NCCIH funded centers that
focus on rigorous scientific investigation of botanical natural products, the Center for High Throughput
Functional Annotation of Natural Products and the Center of Excellence for Natural Product Drug Interaction
Research. To leverage the exceptional training environment at UNCG, we propose to renew a productive T32
program that has just finished its first period of funding. Drawing on a rich institutional culture of diversity at
UNCG, our T32 program provides training in the basic science of natural products and integrative medicine
while emphasizing the recruitment, retention, and success of trainees from diverse backgrounds. The program
is tailored to fit the needs of individual students, with different opportunities provided to those on academic and
industrial career paths. A unique element of our program is training in the application of cutting-edge
technologies for the analysis of complex botanical mixtures. Trainees receive hands-on instruction in this area,
making use of our exceptional NMR and mass spectrometry facilities. Our objective is to prepare trainees to
transition into independent, natural products related research careers. During its inaugural funding cycle, the
program was highly successful towards this goal, with our three graduates securing research positions in the
academic or private sector. Our trainees have also disseminated important research findings, with a total of 67
presentations at conferences and 23 publication coauthorships. With this renewal application, we build on
these past successes and on our assessment outcomes to deliver a plan for student training that will ultimately
advance research on the safe and effective use of natural products and integrative medicine."

 The Pathways Study is a prospective cohort study of women diagnosed with first primary invasive breast
cancer in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) health care system. Enrolled from January 2006
through May 2013, the 4,505 women in the cohort are racially and ethnically diverse, and include 351 (7.8%)
African American, 512 (11.4%) Latina, and 599 (13.3%) Asian women.
 Data have been collected on food intake, physical activity, use of nutritional supplements and
complementary and alternative therapies, and quality of life, social support, doctor-patient communications,
and other factors. We have banked biospecimens at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center including
blood (n=4,034, or 90% of the cohort), saliva (n=4,310, or 96%), and extracted germline DNA (n=4,437, or
99%), and have conducted genome-wide assays through the NIH Center for Inherited Disease Research
program. We have established a biorepository of slides and tumor blocks from initial surgery (n=4,150, or
92%). We have also geocoded baseline addresses and linked these data to contextual databases to create
neighborhood-level social and built environment variables. The KPNC setting provides access to electronic
health records (EHRs), and we have detailed data available on diagnostic characteristics, treatment regimens,
high-grade toxicities, and comorbid conditions. As of February 24, 2020, 572 recurrences, 424 second primary
invasive cancers, and 886 deaths have been identified, with 1,286 women with at least one of these outcomes.
 In this infrastructure competitive renewal application, we propose to maintain and augment the Pathways
Study to support research questions that build upon this resource. Study participants will continue to be
followed for updates and outcomes through biennial follow-up questionnaires. We will maintain our
biorepositories at Roswell Park and KPNC, and expand our tumor specimen bank by collecting slides and
tumor blocks from ~600 recurrences. We will enhance our data resources with ongoing linkage with the KPNC
EHR, and establish new linkages with geospatial environmental exposure databases and California statewide
data on hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and ambulatory surgery. To address relevance to
changes in breast cancer treatment and care, we will complement the cohort by establishing a data-only cohort
of about 48,000 invasive breast cancer cases diagnosed and treated in KPNC from 2006-2023, will extract
data from the KPNC EHR, and link to geospatial and statewide health care data, as with the Pathways Study.
 We will continue engagement with our External Advisory Board and Community Advisory Board to help
guide infrastructure activities and prioritize research use of this cohort. We will also create a Pathways Study
data enclave that will enable investigators to readily explore data and biospecimen availability for analyses or
research projects. Continued support will enhance this unique, outstanding, multi-level, multi-dimensional,
innovative resource, and facilitate its availability for the broader research community."
10814876,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Obstructed labor accounts for 3-8% of all maternal deaths worldwide and, in many countries, is almost as
prevalent today as it was 30 years ago. Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) is an inadequate size of the maternal
pelvis, compared to the fetal head, which prevents the fetus from passing through the pelvic cavity during
delivery, causing obstructed labor. CPD-related obstructed labor requires delivery via Caesarean section (C/S).
CPD is especially prevalent in places like Ethiopia, where girls are small in stature, grow up malnourished, marry
at a young age, or become pregnant before the pelvis is fully grown. Maternal and perinatal mortality in Ethiopia
are among the highest in the world 7 and, 11% of maternal deaths are due to obstructed labor. The consequence
of CPD-related obstructive labor (in the absence of C/S) is often maternal and/or perinatal mortality or morbidity;
e.g., 1 in 250 women report having an obstetric fistula. Ethiopia has showing tremendous increases in the uptake
of antenatal care and deliveries in health facilities over the past few years; yet, the rate of C/S remains very low
(1.9%) due to the lack of infrastructure and surgical expertise and lack of timely assessment of the most at-risk
mothers. In the Ethiopian public health sector, maternal care and delivery is provided at no cost, including making
provisions for high-risk pregnancies to be transferred, lodged, and cared for to appropriate facilities. There is a
pressing need to develop, and translate to clinical use, safe, affordable, easy-to-use, acceptable, and accurate
methods to identify mothers at high-risk of obstructed labor, before the onset of labor, so high-risk mothers can
be transferred to facilities where C/S is a viable option. The purpose of this proposal is to (i) validate risk scores
over an adequately powered sample, over a broader range of gestational ages (12-42 weeks) and over 6 tribal
regions in Ethiopia, (ii) to test the feasibility of introducing a low-cost, smartphone enabled ultrasound to improve
CPD risk assessment in Ethiopia, (iii) quantify the context of use for the proposed intervention and improve
ease-of-use and beneficiary acceptability of these CPD risk assessment tools, and (iv) identify and overcome
barriers to CPD risk assessment and referral follow-up of high-risk mothers to primary hospitals, where C/S is
an option. Successful realization of these aims will provide adequate validation, usability, acceptability, and first
clinical use data for these novel CPD risk assessment tools in Ethiopia and position this innovation well for a
broader clinical study to assess impact of integrating these tools across the primary health care sector in Ethiopia
and, ultimately, integration into routine antenatal care. Further, with modest validation studies in other countries
with a high CPD burden (e.g., Nigeria, India), this innovation can be translated to have a broader impact in saving
lives at birth."

Sleep is an enigmatic behavior that is conserved across the animal kingdom. The mechanisms underlying the
regulation of sleep remain poorly understood, and the function of sleep is even more elusive. Yet,
dysregulation of sleep is a major cause of human morbidity, and understanding why we sleep is a fundamental
question in neuroscience research. We propose that gaining a deep understanding of sleep requires studying
this process across molecular, circuit, neurophysiological, and behavioral levels. To accomplish this, our group
has been using a multidisciplinary, cross-species approach (Drosophila and mice) to study sleep. The recent
work of our group has coalesced around two main themes: how circadian time organizes sleep and arousal
and how dedicated neural circuits encode homeostatic drive. Our investigations into these processes have led
to new insights into 1) the conserved molecular mechanisms mediating the circadian regulation of sleep and
arousal; 2) how different types of neural codes impact plasticity and behavior; and 3) how sleep drive is
generated, released, and persists in time. In this research program project, we will build upon our prior studies
of the circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep and develop new approaches to investigate the
neurophysiology and function of sleep. First, we will address whether the temporal coding mechanisms found
in Drosophila clock neurons are also conserved in the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus. Compared to our
understanding of the circadian clock, much less is known about the homeostatic regulation of sleep.
Nevertheless, we predict that the nature of neural circuits underlying sleep homeostasis will be conserved, and
we will seek to identify a sleep homeostatic integrator circuit in mice. Our studies of the cellular mechanisms
mediating sleep homeostasis have led us to examine the role of astrocytes in sleep behavior. We plan to
determine whether sleep-regulating molecular pathways in these cells are conserved and will perform
systematic investigations into the role of astrocytes in regulating neuronal physiology and behavior. To fully
exploit the power of the Drosophila model for studying sleep, we will develop a new multimodal imaging
method for characterizing and quantifying sleep. Our research has largely focused on how sleep is regulated,
but in the future will also address the function of sleep in neural plasticity using a simple, defined circuit and
new electrophysiological methods. Finally, we are extending our studies into human disorders, including
studying the genetic basis of familial sleepwalking. Our goal is to not only delineate conserved mechanisms
underlying sleep and its function, but also to uncover fundamental neurobiological principles governing these
processes."
10836048,"Mechanistic Insights into Mammalian DNA Methylation
ABSTRACT
DNA methylation in mammals is a major epigenetic mechanism that is essential for transcriptional silencing of
retrotransposons, genomic imprinting, and X-chromosome inactivation. Aberrant DNA methylation leads to
genomic and chromosomal instabilities and silencing of tumor suppressor genes, which contribute to the
development of cancers and many other human diseases. Mammalian DNA methylation is established and
maintained by two groups of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs): de novo DNMTs (DNMT3A and DNMT3B),
which are responsible for establishing the DNA methylation patterns during gametogenesis and early
embryogenesis, and maintenance DNMT (DNMT1), which propagates DNA methylation during mitotic division.
We have a long-standing interest in mechanistic understanding of mammalian DNA methylation, which has led
us to unravel the molecular basis of DNMT1-mediated maintenance DNA methylation and DNMT3A/3B-
mediated de novo DNA methylation. The activities of these DNMTs are governed not only by their intrinsic
enzymatic specificities, but also by an intricate network of cellular factors, such as histone modifications and
chromatin modifiers. However, the mechanism underlying the functional regulation of the DNA methylation
machinery remains poorly understood, partly due to the lack of structural and dynamic information on DNMTs
under the chromatin environment. Our research program focuses on addressing this important challenge
through an approach that integrates structural biology with biochemistry, molecular biology, and cell biology.
We have two long-terms goals: to provide a comprehensive understanding of the structure and mechanism of
DNA methylation machinery, and to identify the relationship between DNA methylation, gene regulation, and
human diseases. Our work in the past has led to structure-function understanding of the protein-protein and
protein-DNA interactions underpinning discrete steps of mammalian DNA methylation. We have identified
multilayered mechanisms, involving intricate interplay between intramolecular and intermolecular interactions,
for the substrate specificity and chromatin association of both maintenance and de novo DNA methylation
machinery. Our goal in the next five years is to gain a mechanistic understanding of mammalian DNA
methylation at the chromatin level, with emphasis on four new directions: (i) structural understanding of
mammalian DNA methylation in the chromatin context, (ii) dynamic characterization of mammalian DNA
methylation, (iii) protein engineering targeting specific DNA methylation pathways, and (iv) deciphering the
regulatory network of mammalian DNA methylation. Together, these combined studies promise to lead us
toward a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of mammalian DNA methylation."
10840262,"This is a competing renewal for R-01 DK 105015, which ran for four years from 3/01/16 to 2/29/20. The
project focuses on developing drugs that induce human beta cells to regenerate for people with Type 1 and Type 2
diabetes (T1D and T2D), both of which ultimately result from inadequate numbers of normally functioning beta cells.
Small molecule drugs that inhibit the kinase, DYRK1A, such as harmine and others, are very reproducibly able to
induce adult human beta cells to replicate, but at low rates (~2%/day). More recently, we have shown that adding
any small molecule DYRK1A inhibitor to either a TGF-beta superfamily inhibitor (TGFβI’s) or to a GLP1 receptor
agonist (GLP1RA), such as GLP1 or exendin-4, markedly enhances beta cell proliferation to rates averaging 5-
8%/day, and that this translates to marked increases in actual numbers and mass of human beta cells in vivo, when
transplanted into NOD-SCID-gamma (NSG) mice. Thus, during the period of this grant, through the work of
ourselves and others, the field of human beta cell regeneration for T1D and T2D has transitioned from impossible to
clearly possible.
 In this proposed renewal, we seek to learn why some DYRK1A inhibitors - but not others - are able to
enhance human beta cell differentiation and function, while also driving beta cell proliferation. Maintaining beta cell
differentiation will be an essential feature of any beta cell regenerative drug. We expect to identify the underlying
signaling pathway(s) that explain this surprising and very positive effect. We also will explore the efficacy of
DYRK1A inhibitors, in combination with GLP1RA’s, in essential but previously unexplored animal models of T1D
and T2D, strengthening pre-clinical relevance. Finally, using sophisticated medicinal chemistry approaches, we
have identified, synthesized and patented entirely novel and extremely potent human beta cell regenerative
DYRK1A inhibitors. We now need to optimize, using computational predictions and advanced medicinal chemical
syntheses, cleavable linkers designed to attach our next-generation potent and selective human beta cell DYRK1A
inhibitors to potential beta cell-targeting molecules. Thus, the Specific Aims of this application are to:
1. Decipher Mechanisms Underlying the Beneficial Pro-Differentiation Effects of Select DYRK1A Inhibitors.
2. Define in vivo Efficacy of DYRK1A inhibition in Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Models.
3. Develop Linkers to Novel Classes of DYRK1A Inhibitors for Targeted Delivery to Beta Cells.
 These goals are both achievable and directly responsive to the goals of aims of the NIDDK. They provide a
realistic basis for generating a new and urgently needed class of therapeutics for T1D and T2D."
10817874,"ABSTRACT Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common malignancy and the third most lethal cancer
worldwide, with a 5-year survival rate of 5-10% in advanced stages. The long-term goal of our research is to
develop novel interventions to prevent and treat gastric cancer (GC) based on molecular targeting of crucial
events in GC carcinogenesis. This application is based on an exciting finding that mice with villin-promoter–
driven PPAR-d overexpression (villin-PPAR-d mice) spontaneously developed large and invasive GCs. Our
published data showed that PPAR-d was upregulated in human GC tissues and this upregulation was
associated with poor prognosis of patients. Villin promoter is active in a small subpopulation of gastric epithelial
cells that are considered villin-positive gastric progenitor cells (V-GPCs). Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought
to arise from transformation of normal stem/progenitor cells to drive tumor formation. We found that PPAR-d
enhanced the stemness of V-GPCs and enabled V-GPCs to form tumors via activating the PPAR-d–interferon-
gamma (IFNG) signaling loop. Furthermore, we also found 1) CCL20 is the most markedly upregulated
chemokine by PPAR-d overexpression in V-GPCs, and 2) CCR6+CD45+ cells (CCR6 is the sole receptor of
CCL20) have significantly higher IFNG mRNA expression than CCR6-CD45+ cells do. Helicobacter pylori (H.
pylori) is a class I carcinogen for human GC. Chronic H. pylori infection, currently affecting nearly half of the
world population, is a known strong risk factor for human GC. H. pylori infection increases PPAR-d, CCL20, and
IFNG, which in turn promotes H. pylori–induced gastric inflammation, enhances GPCs’ stemness and promotes
gastric epithelial proliferation in mice and humans. Whether this PPAR-d overactivation is required for H. pylori–
induced GC is largely unknown. Addressing this knowledge gap is important to the public, especially for
individuals who suffer from chronic H. pylori infection, because PPAR-d is a druggable protein for which both
agonists and antagonists have been developed, and PPAR-d agonists are being used for noncancerous
indications (e.g. enhancing muscle endurance). Thus, we hypothesize that PPAR-d overactivation in GPCs
drives GC via upregulating the PPAR-d–CCL20/CCR6–IFNG signaling pathway and molecular targeting of this
pathway could be a novel intervention modality for GC. Aim 1 will determine the role of PPAR-d upregulation in
V-GPCs and Lgr5-positive GPCs (L-GPCs) at adult onset on GC carcinogenesis. Aim 2 will determine the effect
of PPAR-d genetic deletion/loss of function in V-GPCs or L-GPCs on H. felis-induced GC tumorigenesis. H.
felis is a close relative of H. pylori that has analogous effects in mice to those of H. pylori in humans. Aim 3 will
determine the molecular mechanisms underlying dysregulated PPAR-d–IFNG signaling and evaluate the
effects of molecular targeting of this pathway on GC carcinogenesis. We expect that completion of this proposal
will not only provide new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of GC, but also advance the development of
novel mechanism-based approaches for GC prevention and therapy."
10840463,"Eukaryotic cells deploy at least three multisubunit, DNA-dependent RNA polymerases to
express the robust variety of RNAs required for cell survival and proliferation. In contrast to
prokaryotic cells which express a single RNA polymerase, eukaryotic RNA polymerases have
evolved into specialized cellular roles. RNA polymerase I (Pol I) synthesizes the majority of
ribosomal RNA, Pol II synthesizes messenger RNA and most regulatory RNAs, whereas Pol III
synthesizes transfer RNA and the 5S ribosomal RNA. While this ""division of labor"" among the
nuclear Pols has been appreciated for many years, substantial gaps in our understanding of the
functional divergence between the eukaryotic RNA polymerases remain. How do the enzymatic
properties of these enzymes differ? How do these functional differences influence regulation of
transcription by associated transcription factors? How do divergent enzymatic properties of the
Pols impact their unique cellular roles? The answers to these questions are fundamentally
important for understanding eukaryotic biology.
 It is well established that the rate of ribosome synthesis is proportional to the rates of cell
growth and proliferation. As a consequence, several labs around the world seek novel inhibitors
of ribosome synthesis as potential anticancer chemotherapy agents. Since transcription of the
ribosomal DNA by Pol I is the first, rate-limiting step in ribosome synthesis, Pol I has emerged
as a key target for the development these inhibitors. In order to selectively inhibit one RNA
polymerase without affecting the others, it is crucial to understand the fundamental properties of
the enzymes as well as the cellular mechanisms by which the enzymes are controlled. Thus,
defining Pol I activity and its cellular roles has immediate translational value.
 By defining the landscape of eukaryotic transcription and the many cellular roles of Pol I, this
project will reveal answers to fundamental questions in evolutionary biology while informing
ongoing studies aimed at therapeutic targeting of ribosomal RNA synthesis. To reach these
goals, our lab has developed a robust platform of experimental approaches including
biochemical, biophysical, genetic, and genomic methodologies. We have pioneered the
development of both the experimental and analytical strategies required to rigorously and
thoroughly define the functional properties of RNA polymerase I. The overall goal of this project
is to leverage these experimental strengths to impact our overall understanding of eukaryotic
gene expression and to lay the foundation for ongoing and future studies aimed at therapeutic
inhibition of Pol I."
10827469,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cell development and differentiation require lineage specific mechanisms by which cells initiate programs
of gene expression. In normal conditions, lineage determination involves activation of genes that are
transcriptionally silent by specific transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, coactivators, and other lineage
specific molecules. Skeletal muscle differentiation is an excellent model for studying fundamental principles of
tissue-specific gene expression and differentiation as there is a significant understanding of mechanisms
controlling myogenic-specific gene expression. However, emerging evidence shows a novel category of
Copper (Cu)-binding factors that may have a previously unappreciated direct impact in the regulation of
myoblast proliferation and differentiation.
 Cu is an essential trace metal that serves as a catalytic co-factor for a wide variety of enzymatic reactions
that play critical roles in life. Cu deficiency and overload leads to pathophysiological conditions including
Menkes and Wilson’s diseases, neutropenia, impaired iron absorption, peripheral neuropathy, mitochondrial
deficiencies and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Therefore, the mechanisms for Cu distribution and usage in
different tissues and organs, as well as the consequences due to dysregulated Cu acquisition, are important to
human health. Limited information is available regarding Cu and Cu-binding factors and their mechanisms of
action in myogenesis and most developmental processes. We propose to elucidate novel mechanisms of gene
regulation that drive muscle differentiation and development and that are dependent on copper and Cu-binding
transcription factors. We propose integrative studies that combine diverse molecular, biochemical and
spectroscopic techniques to characterize novel molecular mechanisms by which Cu-binding factors regulate
myogenic differentiation. We propose a novel model where Cu controls myogenesis by activating Cu-TFs that
may act synchronously, either by acting on different promoters at the same time or by acting sequentially at
different stages of differentiation, or both. Our experiments will identify new components and mechanisms for
mammalian Cu-binding factors in the regulation of lineage-specific gene expression. Our studies also will
establish a basis for understanding muscular diseases related to aberrant Cu biology using well-characterized
mouse models for Menkes and Wilson’s diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive lineage
specific gene expression dependent on Cu will greatly advance our knowledge of several Cu-related diseases."
10841527,"We propose to establish a best practice for implementation of a multifaceted approach designed to attenuate
perioperative ESKAPE (Enterococcus, S. aureus, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter spp.)
transmission and associated surgical site infection (SSI) development. Perioperative ESKAPE transmission
(inoculum) contributes to the development of surgical site infections (SSIs) which affect 3-5% of patients
undergoing surgery. SSIs increase patient morbidity, prolong hospitalization, increase the risk of intensive care
unit admission, and increase the risk of death 2-fold. ESKAPE pathogens are particularly problematic.
Sustained reductions in epidemiologically-related, perioperative S. aureus transmission events achieved via a
multi-faceted approach including surveillance feedback optimization resulted in substantial SSI reductions
(88% decrease). An evidence-based approach for attenuation of the perioperative bacterial inoculum2 must
integrate improvements in provider hand hygiene, intravascular catheter design/handling, environmental
cleaning/organization, and patient decolonization. In this application, we propose a type 1 hybrid
effectiveness-implementation using a 2x2 factorial cluster-randomized design guided by RE-AIM. We aim to
identify a best practice for addressing the perioperative ESKAPE inoculum. We will examine the relative
effectiveness of increased site awareness and commitment to generating improvements via technical
assistance (TA), team coaching implementation of an evidence-based set of interventions (EBIP), and TA or
EBIP with ESKAPE transmission surveillance feedback. Our strong preliminary data from a randomized trial
implementing a multifaceted program with surveillance has demonstrated substantial and statistically
significant reductions in transmission of S. aureus and 90-day SSIs and recently reproduced our randomized
trial findings in an additional external site. Therefore, our prior research strongly suggests that the proposed
research should be done and justifies scaling up to dissemination and implementation. Our exceptional
multidisciplinary team is well equipped to successfully complete the proposed trial and aims. In the proposed
trial guided by RE-AIM, we will advance scientific knowledge and inform future dissemination and
implementation by investigating how best to scale-up an already successful multifaceted approach to national
dissemination through either TA or EBIP with or without surveillance. We will conduct a rigorous cost-
effectiveness analysis including evaluation of net cost savings. The proposed trial guided by RE-AIM (Aim 1),
the addition of 1-year follow-up for sustainability (Aim 2), and cost-effectiveness analysis (Aim 3) will provide
the essential scientific knowledge to adopters and organizers to be able to reproduce the most effective
delivery method of our interventions to their local setting in addition to informing our investigative team which
approach to scale-up to reach national dissemination."
10895279,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The objective in this application is to exploit stereochemically robust thioamides, at any point in the peptide se-
quence, as biophysical probes to address current barriers in peptide synthesis, folding, and drug discovery.
There is a perception that current methods to incorporate thioamides into peptides are sufficient. However, as
an example, the rapid racemization of the alpha-carbon stereochemistry of thioamide residues during synthesis
belies that perception. Indeed, a survey of reported peptides containing thioamides points to these limitations.
The majority of ‘successful’ sequences incorporate the thioamide close to the N-terminus, where exposure to
synthetic reagents is necessarily minimized during Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) procedures.
Thus, the instability of thioamides during Fmoc SPPS present a significant barrier to the synthesis and evalua-
tion of thioamide peptides, and restricts the sequence space in which thioamides can be employed. Anecdotal
reports indicate that many labs have wished to employ thioamides in a variety of peptide studies, but a lack of
documented pitfalls and synthetic options leads to intractable peptide products and, ultimately, abandonment
of such ventures. The approach in this proposal is to protect the thioamide, in analogy to the protection of the
functional groups of amino acid side chains, in order to preserve the thioamide moiety during peptide elonga-
tion. The rationale for this approach is that thioamide protection can be easily included within the standard
SPPS work-flow to enable novel applications in peptide synthesis, backbone modification, and protein-drug
interactions. The research plans of this project will exploit thioamides to probe protein folding and site-selective
insertion other chemistries. Thioamides will be employed in previously uncharted sequence space to address
fundamental questions in protein folding. We will also develop methods to transform thioamides into functional
groups that will unlock new constrained peptide scaffolds. Peptides with persistent structure hold tremendous
promise as therapeutics to bridge the performance gap between small molecules and biologics. Finally, this
work will identify strategies to interrogate and target therapeutically relevant protein-protein interfaces. Interac-
tions between hydrogen bond donors and acceptors of the main-chain of a peptide and a protein binding target
are underutilized in drug design. Based on structural bioinformatics, new strategies to identify underutilized in-
teractions at protein-protein interfaces (PPIs) will assist in the design of more potent inhibitors. Other work will
also develop new tools to interrogate PPIs for which very little structural information may be available to inform
future experimental design. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantive departure
from the status quo by developing and employing new methods to preserve thioamide stability, which promises
to unlock new research horizons. The contribution is significant because it is expected to have broad im-
portance in both the study of protein folding and the development of bioactive molecules."
10619240,"Chronic stress exposure is implicated in several psychological disorders such as PTSD, anxiety, depression,
and addiction, and stressful experiences are one of the most common causes of drug relapse. The Bed
Nucleus of the Stria Terminals (BNST) is known to mediate many stress responses and anxiety-like behaviors
that contribute to the cycle of relapse characteristic of substance use disorders. In the BNST, cells expressing
corticotropin-releasing factor (BNSTCRF) play a role in increasing anxiety-like behaviors, and inhibition of CRF
signaling in the BNST can prevent stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking in rodent models. However,
clinical efforts to target the CRF system as a treatment for substance use disorders have proved largely
unsuccessful, highlighting the need for innovative therapeutic targets. BNST cells expressing Protein Kinase C-
delta (BNSTPKCd) are an equally abundant but largely distinct population from the BNSTCRF cells. We have
found that expression of this kinase is also dynamically regulated by stress, but the role of PKCd and
BNSTPKCd cells in stress responses and anxiety-like behaviors remains understudied. Specific Aim 1 details
the progress the applicant, Kellie Williford, has made toward characterizing the function of BNSTPKCd cells in
stress- and anxiety-like behavior using a combination of in vivo optogenetics and fiber photometry approaches.
The F99 phase of this proposal (Specific Aim 2) will expand upon these findings by investigating the function
of BNSTPKCd cells through circuit-based connectivity. Here, rabies-mediated tracing will be used to determine
the brain-wide afferents of the BNSTPKCd population. Additionally, shRNA-mediated knockdown will be used to
investigate the functional significance of PKCd expression within cells in the BNST in mediating anxiety-like
behavior. The K00 phase of this proposal (Specific Aim 3) will help prepare the applicant for a successful
academic research career investigating the contributions of stress to drug relapse in substance use disorders.
This postdoctoral phase will provide Ms Williford with experience in addiction-based experimental techniques
and sharpen critical managerial and mentoring skills to thrive as an independent investigator. In doing so, this
proposal will help provide insight into potential new therapeutic targets that can be manipulated to prevent
maladaptive stress responses. In the long term, it will also equip the candidate to extend this work to stress-
induced relapse of drug seeking and improve treatment outcomes for those struggling with substance use
disorders."
10904641,"Music is a powerful memory cue that can reliably transport us to our past -- in 
effect, strengthening the associative bond between our present and our past. Modern 
neuroscientific investigations of episodic memory could benefit from the use of music due to its 
role as a potent memory cue. In this proposal, my goal is to understand how music shapes memory 
 for past events and how these associations between events are represented in the brain. 
The proposed work builds on recent functional MRI studies that have used naturalistic experimental 
paradigms such as movie watching and recall to test and refine theories of memory 
that (previously) had only been tested under highly-controlled conditions. Here we explore how film 
scores shape memory for movies. In movies, film scores sometimes have recurrent structure where a 
particular theme song will be repeated throughout, potentially bringing back to mind information 
from previous events in which that theme song had been played. Based on prior work showing 
 that retrieval of a memory strengthens that memory, we predict that the presence of 
recurrent musical structure in a film will trigger retrieval of previous events during 
movie-watching, which (in turn) will boost memory for these events on a later recall test. In our 
study, two groups of participants are recruited: The first group watches a version of a movie in 
its original form (with the film score intact) and the control group watches the same film with the 
entire film score removed (while preserving dialogue and ambient sounds). Participants from both 
groups are asked to return the following day to recall the entire movie in chronological order. By 
comparing neural activity between scenes containing music and previous scenes containing the same 
(or similar) music between the two groups, we expect to find evidence of neural reinstatement of 
past scenes in the music group; furthermore, we predict that higher levels of reinstatement during 
movie-viewing will be associated with better subsequent recall of the movie in the music group 
relative to the control group. This work will provide basic-science insight into how memory works 
in real-world contexts. It will also shed light on how musical cues can strengthen memories and 
improve recall; if the predicted cueing effects are observed, these techniques could be used in 
future work to boost performance in memory-impaired clinical populations."
10843948,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Animals contain a small number of germline stem cells (GSCs) that are essential for making sperm or eggs.
The decision for a dividing stem cell to renew itself or to differentiate, and the regulation of early GSC divisions
are some of the most critical processes in development. Studies in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, have
identified many of the key genes involved in the cellular signaling for GSC maintenance and differentiation. We
have shown that the gene bag of marbles (bam), the key “switch” for GSC differentiation, is adaptively evolving
with a dramatic excess of amino acid substitutions in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. yakuba but not in six
other related species. During our current funding period we have generated new bam null mutations in
sequenced genomes of D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. yakuba, D. teissieri, and D. ananassae to test for
conservation of function. These have allowed us to demonstrate that surprisingly unlike in D. melanogaster,
bam is not required for female GSC differentiation in D. teissieri nor is it required for male GSC differentiation
in D. teissieri and D. ananassae. We have shown that infection with different strains of the intracellular
endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis vary in their degree of rescue of the fertility defects characteristic of the bam
hypomorph. This proposal focuses on identifying the functional and evolutionary consequences of observed
sequence diversification at bam and discriminating between the hypothesis that bam’s role in GSC function
has been selected for new functions, vs the hypothesis that interactions between bam and W. pipientis has
been the evolutionary force driving changes at bam. This includes generating and analyzing novel bam
hypomorphs in D. melanogaster and D. simulans, and testing interactions of these new hypomorphs with intra
and interspecific Wolbachia strains. We will carry out RNA-seq studies of the bam rescue by W. pipientis. We
are developing a computational model to generate experimentally testable predictions of sequence
diversification under several mechanisms of interaction between W. pipientis and GSC genes. Finally, we will
functionally evaluate evolutionary diversification of the bam protein sequence between D. melanogaster and D.
simulans, and the loss of the requirement for bam for female and male gametogenesis and fertility in D.
teissieri compared to its close relative D. yakuba. What we learn will contribute significantly to our
understanding of how GSCs are regulated during development in diverse species, how such critical
developmental functions can evolve, and how their mis-regulation due to mutation and interaction with
germline parasites can lead to infertility, germline cancers, and reproductive isolation."
10611140,"An estimated 10-50% of patients develop persistent, disabling, & poorly understood symptoms after COVID-19
(PASC). For many, PASC is phenomenologically like CMI (e.g., Gulf War Illness). A meta-synthesis found
patients with PASC have poor experiences with care. Patients report that, at best, clinicians want to support
them but do not know how, and at worst, clinicians dismiss them as having a “mental health” disorder.
Clinicians report poorly understood conditions, like PASC, are the most difficult conditions to manage. These
descriptions of care for PASC are like those found in decades of research with CMI. Prior research has found
as many as 60% of patients with these conditions are dissatisfied with care, which results in low uptake of
evidence-based treatments and poor health outcomes. A critical gap exists in our understanding of how to
improve the experience of care for patients with poorly understood conditions, like PASC. Our team is well-
positioned to lead research to improve experiences with care for Veterans with PASC. We have led VA
research efforts to understand and improve care for Veterans with CMI. This work has found 3 factors account
for 40% of the variance in satisfaction with care for CMI. We have termed our approach, Concordant Care. The
evidence-based Concordant Care approach involves engaging in processes that: 1) validate the patient's
experience, 2) develop a shared understanding of the condition, and 3) create a patient-centered, whole
health-oriented action plan to manage the condition. This is consistent with published expert opinion that
Concordant Care underlies patients' (and clinicians') positive experiences of care for poorly understood
conditions. Despite strong evidence supporting this care approach, there are no interventions to train clinicians
on practices to provide Concordant Care for Veterans with poorly understood conditions. Our objective is to
adapt, optimize, then test if a Concordant Care training improves VA clinicians' engagement in recommended
practices to achieve Concordant Care (i.e., validate, shared understanding, action plan) for Veterans with
PASC. Achieving this objective is feasible as we have already developed and piloted a CMI Concordant Care
training for >300 VA clinicians, who rated it positively and reported it improved their practice. Our preliminary
experiences suggests that our training is feasible, acceptable, and perceived as useful by VA clinicians and
valued by VA program offices. Design: In Aim 1, we will adapt and optimize our Concordant Care training for
PASC. The Concordant Care clinician training will include didactics, tele-mentoring sessions, and a clinician
pocket card. Veterans who are cared for by trained clinicians will get a prompt to raise PASC concerns with
their clinician. In Aim 2, we will conduct a randomized parallel cluster clinical trial to determine if Concordant
Care training improves primary care clinicians' (n=60) provision of Concordant Care among Veterans with
PASC (n=240), as compared to education packet control. Specific Aims: Aim 1. Adapt and refine Concordant
Care training for PASC using an interactive, iterative, and user-centered design process informed by qualitative
interviews and focus groups to optimize clinician access, uptake, and utilization. Aim 2. Determine if
Concordant Care training increases clinicians' engagement in recommended practices to provide Concordant
Care. Exploratory Aim 3: Explore effectiveness of Concordant Care on Veterans' with PASC care outcomes
including satisfaction, adherence, and disability. Significance. Prior research with Gulf War Veterans showed
the danger in waiting until we better understand the condition and best treatments before providing Concordant
Care. This proposal aims to leverage our experiences with CMI to prevent another generation of Veterans from
leaving the VA, feeling betrayed, and not receptive to new treatments when they become available. It is also
responsive to President Biden's April 5, 2022 executive order addressing the need to quickly improve care for
PASC. Long-term we will use our findings to propose a randomized clinical trial to determine the effectiveness
of Concordant Care training on Veterans with PASC care outcomes."
10809637,"Uterine fibroids affect 70-80% of US women, leading to heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, and infertility. A
prominent feature of uterine fibroids is the presence of a structurally dysregulated and fibrotic extracellular matrix.
Despite their prevalence and the immense public health burden they cause, non-surgical treatment options are
limited.
 Research from many groups has revealed a role of senescent cells in dysfunctional fibrosis, such as
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and foreign body fibrosis. In previous research we demonstrated that senescent
cells secrete soluble factors that modulate immune cells, resulting in a feed-forward loop that reinforces a Type
3 immune response and cellular senescence in a fibrosis model of the foreign body reaction.
 In this project we have used cutting-edge single cell RNA sequencing and new computational methods
to study senescent and immune cells in uterine fibroids. We observed that extensive numbers of senescent cells
were present in human fibroids compared to adjacent uterine tissues which had few, or no, senescent cells.
Immunofluorescence staining revealed p16+ cells with a fibroblastic morphology were present in all fibroid
tissues evaluated. Furthermore, the senescent cells were associated with macrophages and abnormal
vascularity in the fibroids compared to normal tissues. Multi-spectral flow cytometric analysis confirmed changes
in macrophage phenotype and increased numbers of T cells in the fibroids, compared to normal myometrium.
Notably, preliminary single cell RNA Sequencing (scRNASeq) analysis of fibroid and normal myometrium
revealed multiple cell types that exhibited senescent phenotypes, paving the way for further mechanistic analysis
of immune-stromal communication associated with fibrosis. Finally, senescent cell numbers in fibroids decreased
significantly after fibroids were injected with collagenase in a phase 1 clinical trial, in support of senescent cells
as a viable therapeutic target for treatment of fibroids. This research will test the overarching hypothesis that
senescent – immune cell interactions regulate and contribute to abnormal vascularity and fibrosis in fibroid
development and pathogenesis. We will pursue three specific aims.
 Aim 1 seeks to characterize the presence, phenotype, and function of senescent cells and their
interaction with immune cells in uterine leiomyoma. Experiments in Aim 2 will validate key senescent cell
interaction in fibroid development and determine the impact of environmental factors on senescent cells. Aim 3
will evaluate the effect of senolytic drugs on uterine leiomyomas, in vitro and in vivo.
 Elucidation of key relationships and cell drivers of the dysfunctional fibrosis in fibroids is likely to have a
broad impact on the field. Unraveling the cell-cell immune communication networks may explain how myometrial
tissues transform to develop into fibroids. Affirmation of the key role of senescent – immune cell interactions in
fibroid pathogenesis raises the possibility of new treatments targeting senescent cells as therapy."
11018212,"PROJECT SUMMARY
After decades of incremental changes to the food safety system, technological advancements
have ushered in a corresponding period of increased change for both food systems and food
safety. According to FDA’s most recent food safety initiative, the New Era of Smarter Food
Safety, many experts believe the pace of change will continue increasing over the next ten
years, perhaps even more than in recent decades. As old foods are reformulated, new foods are
created, new production and delivery methods are developed, and the entire system becomes
increasingly digitized, complexity for regulators is only going to increase.
The National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) project entitled A People-Centered,
Technology-Driven, Scientific Approach to Advancing Conformance with the Voluntary National
Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards (Retail Program Standards) is intended to:
 • Objective 1: Build and implement a Flexible Funding Model system to provide
 significant subaward funding to state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) retail food
 regulatory programs, to assist them in meeting the requirements of the Retail Program
Standards,
 • Objective 2: Assess and identify the retail training needs of SLTT agencies, and assist
 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in meeting those needs by building and
 establishing a Retail Training Pre-Registration System; and
 • Objective 3: Work with FDA to build and establish a National Retail Standardization
 Registry to better promote and track retail Standardizations nationwide.
These three objectives will advance the Integrated Food Safety System (IFSS) requirements
found in the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) and support the goal of building New
Business Models and Retail Standardization in the New Era of Smarter Food Safety.
By supporting SLTT retail food regulatory programs in their work toward uniformity and
encouraging increased active managerial controls, we will assist the FDA with their goal of
“bending the curve” of foodborne illness by reducing the number of illnesses and related deaths."
10804631,"Project Summary/Abstract
Around 15% of the US population suffers from a motility or functional GI disorder (FGID), like irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS). The pathophysiology of FGIDs remains poorly understood, leading to poorly targeted
treatments. Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) in the GI epithelium release signaling molecules that control many
processes affected in FGID patients, like motility and secretion. A large proportion of FGID patients have
abnormalities in mechanosensation. A population of mechanosensitive EECs in the GI epithelium exhibits
structural and functional similarities with specialized sensory epithelia, such as light touch receptors in the skin.
The mechanosensitive EECs sense physical forces and convert them into hormone release. Thus,
mechanosensitive EECs are primary mechanotransducers in the GI epithelium, and they may be targets for the
treatment of FGIDs. They are characterized by expression of Piezo2, an ion channel that opens in response to
force. Piezo2 generates a receptor current that initiates EEC mechanotransduction. Piezo2 is not the only
mechanosensitive protein in these cells: actin fibers and tight junctions are also critical in epithelial force
transmission. Understanding Piezo2 localization and its functional interactions with other mechanosensitive
proteins is important for understanding sensory epithelial mechanotransduction. The overall goal of this
proposal is to uncover mechanisms by which mechanosensitive proteins work together in EECs to make them
efficient force sensors. The hypothesis is that the actin cytoskeleton plays a critical role in Piezo2+ EEC
mechanotransduction by linking the channel to other mechanosensors and directly changing channel currents.
Aim 1 investigates the assembly of mechanosensory proteins in the EEC by superresolution imaging and co-
immunoprecipitation studies. These experiments explore direct and indirect interactions between the
mechanosensors Piezo2, actin fibers and claudin-4. Aim 2 investigates how these mechanosensors affect
overall EEC mechanotransduction by tracking force-induced calcium transients and electrophysiological
studies of Piezo2. These experiments explore how force is transmitted in epithelial sheets to initiate the
receptor current. The results of this work are poised to bridge knowledge gaps in Piezo2+ EEC
mechanotransduction, as well as inform broader mechanosensing mechanisms in sensory epithelia. The
proposed work will be carried out in a supportive environment that provides cutting edge tools and expert
knowledge towards achieving the specified goal, including collaborations with experts in cytoskeletal
biology,and an imaging core with vast experience in the proposed imaging techniques. The proposal includes a
comprehensive training plan with physician-scientist mentors, by which the PI will gain valuable skills in the
study of molecular mechanotransduction on clinically relevant questions. Along with research activities, the
plan also includes clinical training and shadowing activities to prepare the PI for his transition to the next stage

disease, using Dictyostelium as a discovery tool to inform our studies of neutrophils, macrophages, and
epithelial cells. At the core of our working model are coupled Signal Transduction and Cytoskeletal
Excitable Networks, referred to as STEN and CEN which drive motility. The STEN integrates inputs from
directional sensing and polarity networks to bring about directed migration. In the last grant period, we
found that protrusions are governed by waves of coupled STEN-CEN activities and that manipulation of
negatively charged lipids on the inner face of the membrane can alter network excitability and control cell
behavior. The STEN-CEN concept is conserved in mammalian cells and the networks are hyperactivated
in transformed cells, augmenting motility and macropinocytosis. Since these processes require geranyl
geranylation, statins cause starvation of cancer cells. Finally, we found that vesicles internalized from
retracting protrusions carry “back” components to the rear of the cell contributing to polarity.
How do diverse cellular protrusions depend on the setpoint/threshold of STEN-CEN? We are
combining imaging, synthetic biological, and computational studies to prove that pseudopods,
lamellipods, forming phagosomes, and so on are closely related on a spectrum and interconvertible. We
will show that spatiotemporal patterns of activities and responses to acute molecular perturbations are
consistent across these protrusions and parallel those established in propagating STEN-CEN waves.
What explains the extraordinary coordination of activities in STEN and CEN? Surmising that charge on
the inner leaflet of the membrane is an organizer, we are 1) designing methods to directly monitor charge
in local regions; 2) determining how anionic lipids transiently decrease; 3) manipulating charge locally
with optogenetic systems; 4) examining how the location of key proteins is regulated by surface charge.
Is lowered STEN threshold a general property of transformed cells and can it be exploited? To address
this question, we are 1) comparing threshold indicators, such as propagating waves, with
macropinocytosis and statin sensitivity in a series of increasingly metastatic cell lines and organoids; 2)
identifying the essential geranylgeranylated proteins in STEN; 3) genetically engineering cells to increase
threshold to normalize cancer cells or further decrease threshold to induce cell death.
How does control of STEN and CEN at the cell poles mediate directional sensing and polarity? First,
using a novel suppression assay, we are screening kinase and substrate deficient cells to identify global
inhibitors. Second, we are studying membrane flow in a variety conditions to pursue our “reverse
fountain” model and it reconcile with alternate models that argue membrane flows from front to back.

Excess weight gain during pregnancy among low income pregnant youth is associated with serious multi-
generational morbidity for both the mother and infant. Healthy diet and limiting sugar sweetened beverages
during pregnancy promotes healthy weight gain during pregnancy and impacts permanent fetal genetic
programming that determines risk for chronic disease among infants. Making healthy diet choices convenient
improves quality of diet among youth. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
Children (WIC) benefits cover the cost of healthy foods for low income pregnant women, but most young
mothers are not able to obtain the food due to logistical barriers such as transportation. Grocery delivery is a
well-established and inexpensive service that removes logistical barriers to obtaining healthy food but is
underused by those that may need it most -young pregnant women. The objective of this application is to
determine the impact of delivering healthy foods during pregnancy on the health of low-income young
women and their infants. For this three-armed randomized control trial, subjects are pregnant young women
≤24 years of age who are giving birth for the first time and enrolled in WIC (Arm 1: Usual WIC (Control), Arm 2:
Delivery of WIC-approved food only, Arm 3: Delivery of WIC-approved food PLUS unsweetened beverages).
Subjects are randomly assigned to experimental or control groups. Weight and dietary data will be recorded
throughout their pregnancy for all groups. In both experimental groups (Arm 2 & 3), the intervention will last
from the first trimester of their pregnancy to the birth of their infant. Arm 2 will receive healthy food delivery
every two weeks. Arm 3 will receive healthy food and unsweetened beverage delivery every two weeks. This
project will advance the scientific knowledge about the effect of a simple and inexpensive intervention (grocery
delivery) on weight gain and dietary behaviors among low-income pregnant young women, which can be
applied to policies and practices that affect other vulnerable populations."

The ApoE 4 isoform is the strongest genetic link to Alzheimer’s disease for unclear reasons. ApoE is a lipid
carrying protein. Both the content of the ApoE particles and their release from astrocytes varies by ApoE
isoform. We have found that the mevalonate pathway can regulate both the release of ApoE from astrocytes
and the lipid content of those ApoE particles. Depending on the part of the pathway that we inhibit we can
separate these two functions.
We hypothesize that targeting individual components of the mevalonate pathway can be used to manipulate
the secretion and composition of ApoE in order to reduce Aβ synthesis and improve neuron survival. Further,
we will explore if reducing the lipid content of the ApoE particles, without impacting secretion of the particles,
can help shift the behavior of ApoE4 particles towards the behavior of lower risk ApoE genotypes.
Through the proposed experiments we will test if:
Aim 1. Secretion of ApoE is regulated via the mevalonate pathway in quiescent and activated
astrocytes in an isoform specific manner. There are 3 well-characterized isoforms of ApoE in humans; 2, 3
and 4, which carry varying risks for developing AD. The quantity and composition of lipids carried by ApoE is
influenced by ApoE genotype and astrocyte activation state. We will use mice expressing humanized ApoE 2,
3 or 4 or an ApoE knockout control to grow primary cultures of cortical astrocytes. Astrocytes will be grown in
serum-free media to mimic the quiescent state or treated with TNF, IL-1α and C1q to mimic the activated state.
Utilizing chemical inhibitors, shRNAs and conditional knockouts, we will determine the contributions of the
cholesterol and prenylation arms of the mevalonate pathway to regulation of ApoE secretion by astrocytes.
Aim 2. Inhibition of the mevalonate pathway can improve the abnormal lipid droplet accumulation and
lipid secretion profile in ApoE4 astrocytes. Using the tools from Aim 1, we will manipulate the mevalonate
pathway in astrocytes from ApoE knockout and ApoE 2, 3 or 4 knock-in mice. Intracellular ApoE and lipid
droplets will be assessed by confocal microscopy. The lipid composition of astrocyte conditioned media from
quiescent and activated astrocytes with and without inhibitors to cholesterol synthesis, prenylation or both will
be measured. Changes in cholesterol-lipid carrier interactions will be determined using a cholesterol probe.
Aim 3. Selective inhibition of the mevalonate pathway in astrocytes will reduce amyloid-beta cleavage
and neuron death. We predict that inhibition of cholesterol, while preserving prenylation, will reduce AD
pathology, with the greatest effect in ApoE4 astrocytes. Conditioned media from astrocytes treated with
inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis, prenylation or both will be applied to primary neurons. We will then measure
clustering of APP with lipid rafts by super resolution imaging, Aβ secretion by ELISA, activation of the
lipoapoptotic pathway by western and cell death by ethidium incorporation."

 The University of South Carolina (UofSC) proposes to establish a South Carolina-Advancing
Diversity in Aging Research (SC-ADAR) undergraduate program to increase the number of qualified
under-represented minority (URM) students who pursue scientific graduate studies in programs focusing
on MSTEM (medicine, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines and aging. In the
proposed renewal application, as we have in the first period of program funding, we will continue to partner
with five Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in South Carolina (SC), where low-income,
African American undergraduate students might, through exposure to a research education program
focusing on aging research, choose to enter scientific careers committed to addressing the complex
biological, biomedical, behavioral, and clinical challenges that accompany aging. The proposed R25
represents a continuing effort to use an evidence-based approach to incorporate innovative strategies
into an MSTEM and aging research-education program.
 Specific program aims include: 1) recruiting 40 ethnic minority undergraduates majoring in STEM
fields from five SC HBCUs; 2) Implementing a summer training program, as part of a comprehensive 24-
month SC-ADAR research education approach, over two consecutive summers at UofSC, which
includes multiple components (i.e., supervised research experience in a laboratory, coursework to
increase knowledge of aging-related topics, basic academic skill development through workshops,
mentorship to develop work-life management skills to enhance integration into the academic culture and
community, and reflective social experiences to enhance interest in MSTEM and aging research); 3)
Implementing a co-mentoring mechanism, in which HBCU faculty participate in student mentoring during
the 24-months of SC-ADAR participation; 4) Implementing a transitioning program to assist HBCU
students in the transition from undergraduate to graduate/professional schools; and 5) Conducting a
process evaluation to allow for iterative changes in the program dependent on newly emerging needs,
and an outcome evaluation to assess success of the program in meeting students’ short term,
intermediate, and longer term objectives.
 The likelihood of success is enhanced by strong institutional support from UofSC, UofSC’s
existing infrastructure for advancing diversity in MSTEM, and through the experience of the PI
(Dr. Sue Levkoff) and extensive faculty resources, with their backgrounds in research training in
aging and the STEM fields."
10807003,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Many individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) receive no treatment, including
evidence-based pharmacotherapies. Previous research on AUD medication use has primarily relied on claims
data, and thus focuses on only a portion of the AUD medication treatment process (i.e., filled prescriptions).
Using only claims data, it is not possible to distinguish the characteristics of individuals who do not receive a
prescription from a clinician from those who receive one but do not fill it. It is also not possible to understand
how medication prescriptions and fills fit into the trajectory of AUD treatment received. To design practice and
policy interventions that will improve AUD medication use, clinicians and policy makers need to understand
who “falls off” at each point in the treatment process. We propose to use a dataset from a large national
insurer with linked claims and electronic health record (EHR) data for the period 2010-2023, as well as
interviews of AUD providers, in a mixed methods study. The linked data will allow us to observe written
prescriptions for each patient as well as whether or not the prescriptions were filled. The linked data will also
allow us to incorporate clinically relevant information available in EHRs but not claims. Using these data, we
will: 1) For individuals diagnosed with AUD, identify patient and provider characteristics associated with being
prescribed an AUD medication and the time from index AUD encounter to prescription; 2) For individuals
diagnosed with AUD who are prescribed an AUD medication, identify patient and prescriber characteristics
associated with filling the prescription and with time to prescription fill; and 3) Identify trajectories of AUD care
that incorporate information on prescriptions written for individuals diagnosed with AUD, and examine the
association between different treatment trajectories and indicators of subsequent relapse and injury. The
study's mixed methods approach, including semi-structured interviews of providers who treat AUD about the
factors that influence their AUD medication prescribing decisions, will allow a more nuanced examination of
AUD medication prescribing than quantitative analyses alone allow. The findings will help pinpoint where in the
treatment process different types of people fall out of treatment and how different treatment trajectories are
associated with relapse and injury, informing future intervention and policy design."
10598582,"Liver ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury is a clinically significant problem during and after liver
transplantation, hepatic resection and portal vein reconstruction surgery. Unfortunately, there is no therapy to
prevent or treat hepatic IR injury. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that liver IR injury frequently
results in significant extra-hepatic remote organ injury including kidney, intestinal and lung injury as well as a
systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis. In particular, the incidence of acute kidney injury after
liver resection is extremely high and approaches ~50-80% after major hepatic resection or liver transplantation.
Our previous studies implicate small intestinal crypt Paneth cells as the initiator of extra-hepatic remote organ
injury after liver IR in mice. Furthermore, small intestinal Paneth cells are the predominant source of pro-
inflammatory cytokine IL-17A required for generating hepatic and extra-hepatic injury in mice. However, for
clinical translation of these studies leading to therapy, it is critical that we determine whether Paneth cell
dysregulation and degranulation as well as Paneth cell release of IL-17A also occur after hepatic IR in human
and nonhuman primate liver IR injury models. In this proposal, we will elucidate whether small intestinal
Paneth cells dysregulate and release pro-inflammatory IL-17A after human and nonhuman primate liver IR
injury and whether IL-17A neutralization attenuates liver injury as well as extra-hepatic organ injury after
nonhuman primate IR. Exciting preliminary data suggest that cynomolgus monkey liver IR causes profound
Paneth cell degranulation and Paneth cell IL-17A induction coupled with rapid kidney and small intestine injury.
Furthermore, our preliminary data suggest that cynomolgus monkeys treated with IL-17A neutralizing antibody
had markedly less hepatic IR injury as well as reduced post-operative AKI. Preliminary data also suggest that
human small intestine Paneth cells degranulate after ischemic injury. Based on these preliminary findings, we
hypothesize that hepatic IR injury leads to intestinal Paneth cell dysregulation/degranulation and Paneth cell-
derived IL-17A induction leading to intestinal inflammation and apoptosis, subsequent exacerbation of hepatic
injury and induction of acute kidney injury. We also hypothesize that IL-17A neutralization will attenuate
hepatic, intestinal and kidney injury after liver IR in nonhuman primates. We will utilize both in vivo (highly
translational cynomolgus monkey liver IR and human liver transplant studies) and in vitro (freshly isolated
cynomolgus monkey and human Paneth cells) models to further elucidate the mechanisms and potential
therapy for intestinal and renal injury after hepatic IR by testing the following three specific aims.
Aim #1: To demonstrate remote organ injury and Paneth cell degranulation after liver IR injury.
Aim #2: To demonstrate Paneth cell-mediated IL-17A release after liver IR injury.
Aim #3: To develop therapies to reduce non-human primate liver IR injury induced hepatic and extra-hepatic
organ injury."
10804618,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The incidence of cardiometabolic disease has soared during last half-century despite national efforts to improve
health through universal dietary recommendations. A critical limitation of this approach is the lack of
consideration given to dietary response differences based on an individual’s genetics, which is essential for the
nascent field of precision nutrition. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop the foundation and an
experimental platform to support in-depth biological analyses of precision nutrition interventions. The objective
of this proposal is to develop an experimental genetic reference platform that models human genetic diversity
into a model for precision nutrition. Although largely relying on a discovery-driven approach, the central
hypothesis is that a major failing of public health efforts has been generalization of dietary recommendations and
that through matching dietary recommendations to an individual’s metabolic needs, cardiovascular health will be
greatly improved at the individual and population level. This hypothesis is based on published and unpublished
work. The rationale is that completion of these studies will identify genetic and metabolic factors and high-level
mechanisms by which diet influences differential cardiometabolic health that can be used to develop new
paradigms for precision nutrition. The proposed work will also provide a repository of data and samples from the
Collaborative Cross, a publicly available mouse genetic reference population. The central hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing three aims: 1) Identify cardiometabolic health traits that are influenced by gene-by-diet (GxD)
interactions; 2) Determine the genetic architecture regulating diet-dependent effects on cardiometabolic health;
and 3) Validate a precision nutrition paradigm to predict effects of diet on cardiometabolic disease. These aims
will be pursued using an innovative combination of a novel, publicly available mouse genetic reference population
and human relevant diets for which substantial epidemiological data exists on their cardiometabolic effects. The
proposed research is significant because it will determine the health impact that individual genetic variation has
on response to common diets and identify those characteristics that are influenced by GxD interactions. It is also
significant because it will provide a public database of physiological responses and a sample repository of tissues
for future molecular analyses, providing a critical foundation for the nascent field of precision nutrition. The
expected outcome of this project is a comprehensive understanding of how diet influences cardiometabolic
health in an experimental genetic reference population, an essential first step to support future projects in
precision nutrition. The resulting data will have an important positive impact because it will provide a paradigm
shift toward precision nutrition by: a) identifying cardiometabolic phenotypes influenced by GxD responses; b)
elucidating the genetic architecture and high-level mechanisms of unique responses to diet; c) validating putative
diet responses through confirmatory studies; and d) generating a rich database of GxD responses and a sample
repository for use by the research community."

Background: Male sex workers (MSWs), or men who exchange sex for money, goods, drugs, or other items
of value with other men, are at exceptionally high risk for HIV infection. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is
effective at reducing HIV acquisition among HIV uninfected individuals, but its efficacy is highly dependent on
uptake and excellent adherence. However, uptake of and adherence to PrEP among those who might benefit
the most from using PrEP, such as MSWs, remains suboptimal. A successful PrEP uptake and adherence
package must be responsive and tailored to MSWs’ distinct psychosocial and contextual circumstances.
Overview of Proposal: The current proposal is a culmination of over 10 years of research with this population,
including qualitative research, epidemiological assessments and programmatic work. These formative data led
to an NIMH-funded R34 (MPIs: Biello, Mimiaga, Chan), which allowed our interdisciplinary team and
community partners to collaborate on the development and pilot testing of a theory-based intervention—
“PrEPare for Work”—to address 1) access to and uptake of PrEP at local PrEP clinics/providers via strength-
based case management using principles of motivational interviewing (e.g., focusing on values, strengths and
change efforts, making reflective and empathetic statements), and 2) provide cognitive-behavioral therapy-
informed PrEP adherence counseling (e.g., problem-solving skill-building) with personalized, daily text
message reminders to optimize PrEP adherence among MSWs. The pilot RCT demonstrated the feasibility,
acceptability and preliminary efficacy of “PrEPare for Work”. Conceptual Model: The “PrEPare for Work”
intervention is based on Social Cognitive Therapy (SCT), which specifies a core set of mechanisms that
influence health behavior with a primary emphasis on self-regulation and self-reflection, including self-efficacy.
Overview of Study Design: We now propose to test the efficacy of the “PrEPare for Work” package in the
Greater Providence area and in Los Angeles County using a two-stage randomization design. Stage 1: 500
MSW will be equally randomized to receive either the “PrEPare for Work Stage 1 intervention” (strength-based
case management and facilitated PrEP linkage) or standard of care to evaluate successful PrEP uptake
(verified by real-time tenofovir urinalysis; prescription data) within 2 months. Stage 2: those who initiate PrEP
(n~156; ~55% from Stage 1 intervention arm and ~20% from Stage 1 SOC arm) will be equally re-randomized
to the “PrEPare for Work Stage 2 intervention” (1-on-1 skills training, problem solving, and motivational
interviewing adherence counseling and personalized, daily text messaging reminders) or SOC to assess PrEP
adherence (tenofovir concentration in hair sample) and retention in PrEP care (appointments attended) over 12
months. We will also examine the degree to which improvements in PrEP uptake and adherence occur in the
context of the conceptual mediators (e.g., PrEP motivation, self-efficacy) and moderators (e.g., race/ethnicity,
substance use, perceived HIV risk) of the intervention. Intervention cost-effectiveness will be assessed."
10817250,"Project Summary
The bipotential differentiation of liver progenitor cells to hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells (cholangiocytes)
is integral to liver development, regeneration, and diseases including bile duct paucity and liver cancer. In
particular, the most common congenital liver diseases are associated with bile duct dysfunction. In addition to
the developmental processes during embryogenesis, duct morphogenesis also occurs in the adult liver in
response to severe and chronic injury. These so-called ductular reactions exhibit highly variable differentiation
patterns, and although these reactions significantly contribute to the proliferative responses in the liver, they
remain poorly characterized. Notably, ductular proliferations in the adult liver are concentrated near the portal
vein region, similar to the formation of bile ducts during development. Despite substantial research efforts, the
structural complexity and dynamic nature of liver development and regeneration has limited the comprehensive
understanding of disease mechanisms as well as the advancement of new therapeutic options. The long-term
goal of this project is to develop complementary two-dimensional and three-dimensional engineered tissue
platforms that can be applied towards the investigation of liver progenitor cell differentiation mechanisms that
are presently inaccessible with current cell culture systems and animal models. Towards this end, we will
pursue the following research objectives, which are specifically targeted towards deconstructing the combined
influence of biochemical and biomechanical signals in liver progenitor cell fate specification. In Aim 1, we will
utilize a cell microarray platform to investigate the influence of spatial gradients of Notch signaling and cell
mechanical stresses in progenitor cell differentiation. Our approach will enable the independent control of cell-
cell interactions, defined by multicellular geometry, and specific exogenous microenvironmental signals
presented within the array platform. In Aim 2, we will develop and utilize a three-dimensional microtissue
culture platform to systematically investigate the effects of three-dimensional geometry and determine how
distinct multicellular geometries regulate differentiation patterns. These research efforts will establish
microscale tissue engineering tools that enable the controlled presentation and systematic perturbation of a
range of microenvironmental signals. In Aim 3, we will extend our studies towards the direct analysis of human
liver differentiation mechanisms through the integration of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived
liver progenitor cells. Collectively, our approach will allow for novel studies into the mechanisms of liver
progenitor cell differentiation, including the unique examination of the combinatorial influence of cell
mechanical stress gradients and Notch signaling. Further, we envision that these platforms are generalizable,
and could be implemented as enabling technologies for fundamental biological investigation and therapeutic
development efforts for a broad range of cell and tissue contexts."
10757896,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Little is known about the modulatory mechanisms contributed by extra-retinal inputs to primary visual cortex
(V1), despite their substantial contribution to visual information processing. While a systematic search across
neuromodulators and their receptors is possible, clinical literature provides an avenue to narrow the search of
potential receptors contributing to these circuits. Schizophrenia (SZ) is one example, where patients exhibit
visual processing deficits. Data suggests these deficits are specific to the magnocellular pathway and not the
parvocellular pathway, with shifted contrast sensitivity for sinusoidal grating stimuli at low but not high spatial
frequencies and reduced BOLD signal in V1. Magnocellular and parvocellular inputs from the lateral
geniculate nucleus of the thalamus are known to show distinct patterns of innervation in V1, but whether there
are differences in modulatory mechanisms between these pathways is unknown. Interestingly, there are
reports of both typical and atypical antipsychotic medications improving visual deficits in SZ patients. It is
known these drugs target a variety of receptors for multiple neuromodulators, providing very little insight into
how these drugs may improve symptoms, but showing us that neuromodulation has a profound impact on early
visual processing. Research in SZ has emphasized the role of dopamine and serotonin systems, as the early
typical antipsychotics show very high affinity for dopamine D2 receptors and drugs with psychedelic effects that
may mimic some positive symptoms of SZ target serotonin 5HT-2A receptors. Anatomical studies have
reported both receptor types in V1, with clear laminar patterns, though precise localization of these receptors
on excitatory or inhibitory neurons remains unknown. Here, we propose to study the role of D2 and 5HT-2A
receptors in magnocellular and parvocellular pathways in layer IVC, and in center-surround mechanisms in
layers II/III. Aim 1 will test whether magnocellular and parvocellular inputs to V1 show differences in response
to activating or blocking dopamine D2 receptors and 5HT-2A receptors. Aim 2a will determine if manipulations
to D2 or 5HT-2A receptors impact center-surround mechanisms as a function of stimulus size. Lastly, Aim 2b
will determine if there is an effect of D2 or 5-HT2A modulation center-surround mechanism as a function of
contrast and orientation."
10794253,"Project Summary
 The spinal column is composed of neural and mesodermal tissues, and birth defects, such as scoliosis,
that affect the spinal column can originate from abnormal development of either tissue. There are many forms of
spinal malformation that can occur in development, including scoliosis, or misshapen bone within the spinal
column. Genetic studies, including our zebrafish analyses, show that mutations that perturb somitogenesis lead
to scoliosis phenotypes in zebrafish, mice and humans. Many questions remain about the molecular basis for
congenital spinal malformations.
 Embryonic development requires many gene regulatory networks (GRN) that are activated and repressed
overtime which underlie the dynamic control of morphogenesis. These GRNs are used repeatedly throughout
development but give rise to different developmental outcomes. These differences are critical to achieving the
wide array of cellular phenotypes required for development of an entire organism while using a relatively small
number of genes. The process of elongation of the vertebrate body axis requires tissue patterning, cellular
differentiation and cell migration of multiple tissues simultaneously. In order for all of these complex processes
to occur in the embryo they must be tightly regulated by the dynamic control of multiple GRNs over time. This
project uses an innovative application of deactivated Cas9 technology to investigate how two transcription factors
regulate mesodermal differentiation and cell migration of during early spinal column development. Transgenic
lines will be generated to create heat shock controlled bi-partite CRISPRi and CRISPRa systems to down- and
up-regulate expression of transcription factors required for spinal column development. Phenotypes will be
characterized by morphology and RT-qPCR. RNA sequencing will be used to identify the genes downstream of
these transcription factors. In Aim 2, the CRISPRi/CRISPRa systems will be used to perform a targeted genetic
screen to interrogate the roles of these target genes in the regulation of cell migration during body elongation.
This work will elucidate the roles of these transcription factors, allowing a better understanding of combinatorial
gene function in development as well as the genetic and cellular dynamics of vertebrate body elongation."
10746841,"Molecular Determinants of Synaptic Plasticity in Chronic Pain
The long-term goal of our project is to identify the molecular and signaling mechanisms that govern synaptic
plasticity under chronic pain conditions. Neuropathic pain remains a major therapeutic challenge, and neuronal
plasticity at the spinal cord level is fundamentally important to the development of chronic neuropathic pain. N-
methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are expressed in primary sensory neurons and their central terminals
in the spinal dorsal horn. However, they are functionally inactive under normal conditions and become tonically
activated to potentiate glutamatergic input to spinal dorsal horn neurons after nerve injury and chemotherapy-
induced neuropathy. The molecular mechanisms regulating the synaptic activity and trafficking of NMDARs in
the spinal dorsal horn remain poorly understood. Volume-regulated anion channels, which are formed by multiple
different leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 8 (LRRC8) family members, are crucial to the regulation of cell
volume. In our pilot studies, we found that LRRC8A was highly expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons.
Also, traumatic nerve injury selectively downregulated LRRC8A, but not LRRC8B-LRRC8D, in the DRG.
Furthermore, LRRC8A downregulation or conditional knockout in DRG neurons induces NMDAR-dependent
pain hypersensitivity. Importantly, we discovered that LRRC8A physically interacted with NMDARs to control
synaptic trafficking and activity of NMDARs. In this renewal application, we will specifically determine the roles
of LRRC8A in the regulation of nociception and synaptic NMDARs at the spinal cord level in two neuropathic
pain models. On the basis of our intriguing preliminary data, we propose to test the overall hypothesis that
LRRC8A protein directly interacts with NMDARs and normally restrains the synaptic trafficking of NMDARs at
the spinal cord level; nerve injury or chemotherapy diminishes LRRC8A expression and augments the synaptic
expression and activity of NMDARs, leading to increased glutamatergic input to spinal dorsal horn neurons and
chronic pain. We will apply several innovative and complementary approaches, including biochemical and
cellular analyses, transgenic mice, and synaptic recordings to study how LRRC8A controls NMDARs and
nociception at molecular, cellular, and behavioral levels. Our project will generate fundamental new information
about the molecular basis of NMDAR-mediated synaptic plasticity in neuropathic pain. Findings from our project
are expected to advance our knowledge of molecular mechanisms of nociceptive regulation and to guide the
development of new strategies for treating chronic neuropathic pain."
10798316,"The overall goal of this work is to address clinical unmet needs for patients with lipedema using advanced
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods of vascular and molecular dysfunction, in sequence with portable
clinical measures of adiposity and edema. Specifically, lipedema is a disease marked by subcutaneous adipose
tissue (SAT) accumulation in the lower extremities accompanied by somatic pain and edema, poor quality of life
and significant psychological distress. Importantly, lipedema is commonly misdiagnosed as obesity, yet
symptoms are refractory to interventions for obesity leading to delayed diagnosis typically 22 years after
symptom onset. A recent call to action for lipedema highlights the need for additional lipedema research, as
fundamental gaps persist in our knowledge regarding both disease mechanisms and potential treatments. Over
the past five years and with support from the Lipedema Foundation, we have developed a whole-body imaging
strategy for patients with lipedema to provide a more complete, quantitative perspective on condition features,
as well as to refine appropriate imaging tools. We have demonstrated that lipedema is distinct from obesity using
multi-modal fat-water MRI and limb bioimpedance. We optimized sodium and fat-fraction MRI to demonstrate
significantly elevated tissue sodium and SAT volume in the lower extremities, but not upper extremities, of
females with lipedema compared to matched controls. In preliminary data we demonstrate that skin sodium can
be mobilized by a standard lymphatic therapy, complete decongestive therapy (CDT). Recent findings of
elevated arterial perfusion and inflammatory profiles in lipedema raise significant questions about how blood and
lymphatic circulation are involved in disease pathogenesis. Here we propose for the first time to apply molecular
and vascular (blood and lymphatic) imaging together with common clinical tools to test the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis (1): ultrasound can be used as a more accessible alternative to MRI for measuring subcutaneous fat
deposition and distinguishing lipedema from obesity; Hypothesis (2): tissue sodium reduces following CDT in the
lower extremities, but not in the untreated upper extremities, of patients with lipedema consistent with
improvements in symptomatology; Hypothesis (3): lower-extremity blood flow velocity is elevated, while
lymphatic flow velocity reduced, in patients with lipedema compared to matched controls. Impact: Successful
completion of this study will (1) determine modalities appropriate for lipedema screening, (2) demonstrate effects
of lymphatic stimulation on tissue sodium in lipedema, and (3) advance our understanding of the circulatory
mechanisms involved in lipedema."

 CLL is the most common leukemia of adults in North America, with about 20,000 new cases per year,
and remains incurable. Although a small subset of patients has indolent disease, in the majority of cases CLL
is characterized by steady progression toward therapy and once treated, patients are likely to die of the disease
or its complications. The primary known risk factor is a family history of the disease, and CLL is one of the most
heritable of all cancers, yet the genetic basis of this heritability remains largely unknown. Neither family-based
linkage studies nor genomewide association studies (GWAS) have identified clinically useful genetic variants.
In our prior work, we hypothesized that the high heritability of CLL may lie in rare germline variants associated
with intermediate disease risks, and we identified ATM as the first risk gene for CLL. We further demonstrated
that rare germline missense variants in ATM are associated with loss or mutation of the other allele in the tumor,
as expected for a cancer predisposition gene. We have since identified these germline ATM variants in 25% of
our CLL clinic population, suggesting that ATM may be an important germline driver of CLL. In this grant we will
prospectively enroll CLL subjects who have been evaluated for germline ATM variants into a registry that will
allow us to determine the association of ATM germline variants with CLL clinical features, development of other
cancers and family history of cancer. We will also perform functional assessment of the ATM protein, to
determine the impact of the most common and highest risk of these alleles on protein function. Additionally, we
will expand the prior analysis that identified ATM, to include all publicly available CLL sequencing data, and
employ both a novel highly sensitive variant calling method developed by Google and a novel ancestry matching
method. Our preliminary data with this larger cohort and improved methodology have so far confirmed our ATM
finding and identified FANCE and CHEK2 as additional CLL risk genes, suggesting a role for other DNA repair
genes in CLL susceptibility. We will also focus on higher risk familial CLL with additional exome sequencing,
with a similar analysis as above, and with epigenomic profiling with ATAC-seq to explore the non-coding genome.
Using a unique cohort of highly impacted families, we will combine ATAC-seq with whole genome and RNA
sequencing, to both characterize the gene targets of the GWAS alleles previously identified in CLL, and identify
novel noncoding risk variants that impact transcription regulation. This project is feasible because of the rich
resources of our unique, well-annotated tissue banks of familial CLL developed over the last 15 years. Our goal
with this work is not only to enhance our understanding of the genetic basis of CLL, but also to provide the basis
for improved screening and counseling of CLL patients in the clinic, through eventual initiation of clinical trials to
assess the utility of genetic testing in this patient population."

Genome sequencing of P. falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, has laid the foundation for significant
biological advances by exposing surprising genomic information. The P. falciparum genome is extremely AT-
rich (~80%) and comprised of a large number of genes encoding polyadenosine (polyA) tracks. In most
eukaryotes, including humans, polyA tracks act as negative regulators of gene expression. Our recent studies
have shown that the translation of mRNAs containing polyA track motifs results in ribosomal stalling and
frameshifting in the majority of eukaryotic and bacterial organisms. In contrast to most organisms, P.
falciparum can efficiently and accurately translate polyA tracks. Therefore, we want to understand how P.
falciparum can effectively translate these genes. We hypothesize that potential contributors to P. falciparum's
unique translation mechanism are RNA-binding proteins, variations in the translation quality control machinery,
and adaptations to the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) itself. P. falciparum evolutionary adaptation towards an AT-rich
genome and polyA encoded lysine stretches remains to be explored. We first want to identify proteins in P.
falciparum that bind to mRNAs containing polyA tracks or stalling sequences and determine the components of
the no-go decay mRNA surveillance mechanism within the parasite (Aim 1). By understanding this process,
we will begin to understand the fundamental differences between Plasmodium translation and all other
characterized eukaryotes. We will use an adapted mRNA tagged system to pull-down mRNAs and examine
the proteins binding to these mRNAs in P. falciparum cells (Aim 1a). We also hypothesize that to have an
efficient translation of polyA track genes; there must be a unique relationship between mRNA-containing polyA
tracks, ribosomes, and mRNA surveillance mechanisms in malaria parasites (Aim 1b). We will analyze
features of P. falciparum rRNA involved in polyA translational fidelity and poly-lysine synthesis in vivo (Aim 2).
We will use the MS2-tagged ribosome system adapted for P. falciparum rRNAs and ribosome isolation (Aim
2a). Finally, we believe that PfRACK1 protein aids in polyA track translation in Plasmodium cells. We will
determine if PfRACK1 assists in polyA translation in both plasmodium and human cell lines and will also
examine the differential, stage-dependent ribosomal binding of PfRACK1 within the parasite (Aim 2b).
Association of PfRACK1 protein with P. falciparum and human ribosomes and their interaction with polyA
mRNAs will be further characterized using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET)
The goals of this project are to characterize P. falciparum mRNA surveillance system fully, and we will be
among the first to study the translational complexities in the P. falciparum genome. We believe that this
information will be crucial to fighting malaria and that these unique features of the parasite can be exploited
into new therapeutic targets, thus furthering the battle against malaria."
10792884,"Summary
 Multiple system atrophy, or MSA, is the most common cause of adult-onset neurodegenerative ataxia, and so
far, no disease-modifying therapy has been developed. One of the reasons for this lack of therapy is that the
etiology of MSA remains unclear, though several possible mechanisms have been proposed. Defects in the
synthesis and levels of Coenzyme Q (ubiquinone, CoQ), a lipophillic molecule present in virtually all cell
membranes, represent a common phenomenon in MSA, with or without mutations in the COQ2 gene, which
encodes 4-para-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyl transferase, the second enzyme involved in CoQ10 biosynthesis.
The essential role of CoQ in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation has been explored in the context of
neurodegenerative disease such as MSA. However, other aspects of CoQ biology, such as its role in the
regulation of cholesterol metabolism, have not been investigated.
 Cholesterol homeostasis is maintained in the cell by a tightly-regulated balance between its de novo synthesis,
and its internalization from extracellular lipoproteins. Alterations in this balance result in neuronal dysfunction.
 The biosynthesis of cholesterol and CoQ are two co-regulated branches of the mevalonate pathway. As such,
stimulation of cholesterol biosynthesis also results in increases in CoQ production; thus, decrease in CoQ levels
should result in the subsequent activation of the mevalonate pathway and the de novo synthesis of cholesterol,
followed by inhibition of the internalization of extracellular cholesterol, to maintain homeostasis. We propose
that defects in CoQ biosynthesis induce cell dysfunction by alterations in cholesterol homeostasis via sustained
downregulation of cholesterol internalization (AIM 1).
 Our published data showed that decrease in the internalization of cholesterol, but not its synthesis, results in
defects in the formation of mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM) domains, an ER lipid-raft involved in
the modulation of multiple metabolic pathways, including the regulation of lipid homeostasis. Notably, defects in
the formation of MAM domains have been observed in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, PD and ALS.
Recently, CoQ synthesis has been shown to be regulated at MAM domains in yeast. However, whether this is
also the case in human cells it not known.
 Based on our preliminary data, we propose a novel mechanism by which CoQ defects, via inhibition of
cholesterol internalization, impair the formation of MAM domains and the inhibition of the activities localized in
this domain (AIM 2).
 Our results will elucidate the interplay between CoQ, cholesterol metabolism and MAM function, and its
contribution to neuronal demise in MSA, and other neurodegenerative diseases."
10757921,"We propose to investigate a novel form of microglia Ca2+ signal that we have discovered in awake behaving
mice. It is the first microglia Ca2+ signal identified so far that represents a direct response to active, vigilant
behavior and neuronal activity within short latency (<10 seconds). Due to the complexity of experimental
procedures and the paucity of available data very little is known about microglia Ca2+ dynamics in awake
behaving mice. This is in striking contrast to the expected importance of Ca2+ signaling for microglia function.
From work on cultured microglia it is known that basic cellular processes such as cytoskeletal rearrangements,
which are a prerequisite for cell motility and phagocytosis, as well as most mechanisms underlying the secretion
of signaling molecules such as cytokines depend on intracellular fluctuations of Ca2+. Microglia express
numerous membrane proteins to potentially translate extracellular signals into intracellular Ca2+ elevations.
Among these are purinergic receptors, immune system-related receptors as well as ion channels. Specifically,
microglia express L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs). LTCCs have attracted special attention because antagonists
of this class of ion channels, traditionally applied to control blood pressure, have demonstrated therapeutic
potential for limiting neuroinflammation and cognitive impairments accompanying neurodegenerative diseases.
The contribution of microglia LTCCs to this therapeutic potential is not yet well established and it is not clear
when these ion channels become normally activated. For this proposal we will employ two-photon microscopy
on transgenic mice with microglia-specific expression of the genetically-encoded Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6f. The
mice will be head-fixed on a motorized linear treadmill for precise control over speed and duration of enforced
locomotion events in addition to the monitoring of voluntary locomotion events. Locomotion represents a reliable
means to induce moderate arousal, a behavioral state of heightened vigilance. To avoid a bias by the
experimental conditions the studies will include imaging of microglia through chronic cranial windows several
weeks following surgery as well as acute surgery experiments for topical pharmacology. Our preliminary
pharmacological experiments suggest that locomotion-induced microglia Ca2+ elevations depend on LTCCs. In
Aim 1 we will conduct a systematic characterization of the newly discovered locomotion-induced microglia Ca2+
elevations. We will investigate the kinetic constraints of the responses and test whether V1 microglia Ca2+
responses are affected by visual stimulation. In Aim 2 we will combine microglia-selective gene deletion and
pharmacological experiments to determine which LTCC subtype predominantly contributes to the responses.
Upon successful completion of the proposed experiments we will have established a rigorous foundation for
rational design of future studies aimed at unraveling the consequences of vigilance-dependent microglia Ca2+
responses for circuit activity and behavior. These findings may then open new avenues for microglia-centered
therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases."
10747430,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Binge-eating disorder (BED) is more common than any other eating disorder in the US and is associated with
high rates of medical morbidity, disability, and suicidality. As roughly half of patients with BED remain
symptomatic after current first-line treatments, there is a critical need to identify brain-based factors that
perpetuate BED symptoms and that may serve as mechanistic targets for novel treatments. Current theoretical
models posit that the recurrent, distressing, and out-of-control overeating that characterizes BED arises after a
transition from ventral to dorsal corticostriatal circuit control over decision-making, and a corresponding shift
from goal-oriented to habitual behavior. However, individuals with BED present with a co-occurrence of
seemingly contradictory decision-making problems—impulsivity and perseveration—and a wide range of
binge-eating severity. Neurobiological research to date has failed to account for this within-person combination
of cognitive deficits or this between-person variability in symptoms. The goal of this R21 project is to test a
neurocomputational model of BED that provides a more comprehensive account of symptoms and severity.
This model expands on previous theories and links behavior to effective connectivity in corticostriatal circuits
underlying decision-making. Specifically, the proposed study combines computational modeling of behavior
with dynamic causal modeling (DCM) of neural connectivity to examine whether aberrant within- and between-
circuit dynamics relate to cognitive and clinical symptom profiles in BED. We will compare effective connectivity
of 28 adults with BED to that of 28 group-matched healthy controls during two decision-making paradigms. We
will test two overarching predictions that are informed by our simulations of corticostriatal circuit dynamics and
associated behavior: 1) In individuals with BED, aberrant within-circuit dynamics, specifically overstability (high
“gain”) within dorsal and ventral corticostriatal circuits, result in overweighting of initial evidence (leading to
impulsivity) and promote choice selections that are insensitive to changes in the environment (perseveration);
2) In individuals with BED, aberrant between-circuit dynamics, specifically an over-influence of one
corticostriatal circuit on the other (dorsal on ventral or vice-versa), promote more severe binge eating. These
model predictions can explain the impulsive, out-of-control initiation of binge eating, why individuals with BED
continue to binge eat despite fullness and distress (i.e., perseverate), and why some individuals with BED are
more likely than others to more frequently initiate binge eating episodes. As such, data from this proof-of-
concept pilot study will substantiate a novel neurocomputational model of BED symptoms and characterize
alterations in neural circuit dynamics, not just neural activation, in BED. In addition, the data will support a
future R01 application focused on testing the model among a wider diagnostic spectrum of individuals who
binge eat. This work can ultimately inform new interventions with circuit-based targets to more effectively
interrupt entrenched patterns of binge eating."

 The clinical utility of MR images is largely as a qualitative tool without in-built standardization,
which requires subjective interpretation and time-consuming analysis. Importantly, these
qualitative MRI approaches have demonstrated poor tissue characterization, and poor center-to-
center reproducibility, greatly limiting their use in clinical trials. Availability of a robust quantitative
imaging tool with high tissue discriminability can directly impact clinical care by offering actionable
information to end-user clinicians. As an example, availability of accurate tumor infiltration maps
in Glioblastomas, a highly aggressive brain tumor, can pave the way for novel multisite clinical
trials in personalized radiation therapy and neurosurgery for improved outcomes. None of the
current MRI techniques offer this capability in an accurate and reproducible manner. MRF is a
quantitative imaging scan that can address the limitations of qualitative MRI by providing
reproducible and physiologically meaningful measurements of tissue properties. We have also
shown that utilizing the underlying physical/physiological bounds of the quantitative MRF values
improves the reproducibility of the image analysis techniques. Integration of MRF and advanced
quantitative analytics could fundamentally address the well-recognized low-reproducibility in
qualitative MRI approaches and allow broad clinical translation. In this proposal, we have
established an academic-industrial partnership among MRF developers (CWRU), image analysis
and AI experts (UPenn), Brain tumor imaging experts (UHCMC), and leading healthcare company
(Siemens) to ensure successful clinical translation of the MRF-QIA into the clinical workflow. We
will achieve our goal with the following aims: Aim 1: Establish a high throughput MRF scan and
assess multisite performance for FDA approval; Aim 2: Fully integrate the MRF-QIA image
analytics software into the clinical system for brain tumor analysis; Aim 3: Clinical validation of the
MRF-QIA application for infiltration prediction in Glioblastoma patients. This project will add new
capabilities to the clinical flow directly impacting the end-user experience and patient care: 1) FDA
approval of MRF product scan will allow any Siemens clinical site to add it to their routine patient
scans. 2) The MRF-QIA software will be distributed globally through Siemens Global Digital
Market and will be available for broad clinical and multisite research applications. 3) The
specialized application for GB infiltration prediction will lead to new clinical trials for planning
targeted biopsy, extended resections, and personalized radiotherapy by neurosurgeons and
neuro-oncologists to eventually provide targeted treatment plans for GB patients."
10769833,"Over 40% of Americans are obese, with the prevalence of obesity continuing to rise. Obesity negatively
affects general health and has been attributed to an increasing incidence of diabetes, heart disease, vascular
disease, joint stress, lumbar spine disorders, liver and biliary disease, and various cancers. In the prior granting
period, we developed a minimally invasive, image-guided, percutaneous intervention called bariatric arterial
embolism (BAE), which was tested in growing swine and translated to a Phase I clinical trial in patients, and was
shown to decrease weight gain in growing pigs based on embolic size and target location and safely cause
weight loss in people. While surgical approaches have shown better reductions in weight than BAE, they are
highly invasive (requiring reconstruction of bowel), have variable success rates, and can have significant
complications. Thus, in this renewal application, we seek to refine and develop alternative strategies for minimally
invasive BAE and weight reduction.
 Using a novel microfluidic device to create high-throughput radiopaque embolics and an anti-reflux
catheter, we performed BAE in growing swine and demonstrated the effects of BAE on gastric hormones, i.e.,
ghrelin, gastrin, GLP-1, etc. with smaller embolics being more effective at reducing weight gain. However,
smaller embolics are also associated with increased the risk of severe adverse events including gastric
perforation. Ghrelin, the primary hunger hormone, which is produced primarily in the gastric fundus, remains a
major target for weight reduction. As BAE would be performed in otherwise healthy patients, the risk of non-
target embolization (NTE) to organs that share the same vascular supply as the stomach, such as the liver,
spleen, pancreas, remains a concern as well. Thus, critical issues such as improved targeting, safety, and long-
term efficacy need to be further addressed in order to translate this procedure from animals into patients as a
durable treatment for obesity.
 In this proposal, we seek to improve the safety of BAE using radiolabeled embolics as well as test two
new concepts for minimally invasive, image-guided weight loss. We will test these techniques in obese dogs
rather than growing pigs as a more realistic model of obesity in people. Our Specific Aims include: 1) Evaluate
the safety and efficacy of Yttrium-90 labeled embolics for BAE; 2) Evaluate microencapsulated, iron-oxide
nanoparticle (MIONPs) combined with magnetic hyperthermia (MHT) for weight loss; and 3) Develop MR-guided
vagal cryoablation as a weight-loss strategy to determine long-term minimally invasive techniques for treating
obesity."

 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable, heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder
affecting 1 in 53 children in the US. The prefrontal cortex, which mediates social cognition and language, is oddly
enlarged in at least 15% of patients with ASD who suffer from severe symptoms. Macrocephaly (large brain) is
caused by excessive proliferation of cortical progenitors, and progenitors derived from ASD patients show
excessive proliferation. However, the extent to which prefrontal macrocephaly itself contributes to the
pathophysiology of ASD is unclear.
 ASPM (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated) is a neurodevelopmental gene that determines
cortical size, and may play a role in macrocephaly, as well as in ASD. ASPM controls cell proliferation, and its
loss-of-function mutations are the most common cause of genetic microcephaly (small brain) that are particularly
severe in the prefrontal cortex. Importantly, it is expressed in cortical progenitors but not in neurons. Recently,
de novo variants in ASPM have been associated with ASD. Our preliminary data show that one such variant
increases ASPM protein levels in cultured cells, suggesting gain-of-function mutation. Furthermore, we
generated Aspm knock-in mice with the gain-of-function mutation, which show excessive neurogenesis, perinatal
macrocephaly, and abnormal social behavior recapitulating ASD-like symptoms.
 Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which abnormal cerebral cortical development
underlies functional abnormalities in ASD. Our central hypothesis is that excessive embryonic neurogenesis,
which results in macrocephaly, is sufficient to elicit some ASD-like behaviors by disturbing cell signaling and
composition in the postnatal brain. To test the hypothesis, we will leverage the ASD-associated gain-of-function
mutation in ASPM, and examine Aspm knock-in mice in three Specific Aims. Thus, we will (Aim 1) investigate
the neurodevelopmental trajectory using immunostaining, (Aim 2) determine changes in cell composition and
signaling using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, (Aim 3) social cognitive behaviors in Aspm knock-in mice. Our
proposed research is significant as we directly address the pathophysiological role of macrocephaly in ASD. It
is innovative as we analyze a novel ASD mouse model with a gain-of-function mutation in the
neurodevelopmental gene ASPM using diverse, state-of-the-art techniques.
 Macrocephaly is observed in some ASD patients with severe symptoms. However, the extent to which
macrocephaly itself contributes to ASD is unclear. Our novel Aspm knock-in mice carry an ASD-associated
mutation and display perinatal macrocephaly with abnormal social behavior. Exploring dysregulated cell types
and signaling pathways in Aspm knock-in mice may provide novel therapeutic interventions for ASD."

Fast, robust and reliable quantitative knee joint MR imaging would be a significant step forward in studying joint
degeneration, injury and osteoarthritis (OA). Automation of compositional and morphological feature extraction
of the tissues in the knee it is an essential step for translation to clinical practice of promising quantitative
techniques. It would enable the analysis of large patient cohorts and assist the radiologist/clinician in augmenting
the value of MRI.
Automation of several human tasks has been achieved in the last few years by the usage of Deep Learning
techniques. With the availability of large amounts of annotated data and processing power, using the concepts
of transforming data to knowledge by the observation of examples, supervised learning can today accomplish
challenges never demonstrated before. In addition to image analysis and interpretation, Deep Learning is
revolutionizing the acquisition and reconstruction aspects of the pipeline. Models can learn a direct mapping
between under sampled k-space and image domain.
While Deep Learning application to musculoskeletal imaging showed promising results when applied in a
controlled setting, it is well understood that generalization beyond the statistical distribution of the training set is
still an unmet challenge. In MRI this translates into poor performances when trained models are tested on
different imaging protocols or images acquired on different MRI systems.
With this proposal, we aim to leverage on this recent advancement and filling the existing gaps. We aim to study
novel integrated models able to simultaneously accelerate MRI acquisition and automate the image processing
that can overcome the limitation of single domain application. Fast image acquisition and accurate image post
processing are typically considered to be separate problems. However, the neural networks optimization design
gives us an opportunity to integrate the two to maximize both acceleration and machine-based image processing
and interpretation. We will use both publicly available benchmark dataset (FastMRI) and internally collected
dataset to build deep learning models able to accurately reconstruct under sampled MRI acquisitions. We will
use a dataset prospectively acquired during the course of this study to validate the clinical applicability of the
developed methods. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that the proposed integrated pipeline can be applied
in clinical setting for a fast and intelligent knee scan obtaining image quality comparable to standard acquisition
and automated processing accuracy comparable with human reproducibility.
Additionally, we propose to make our annotated image datasets and trained models a shared resource, a
centralized, open evaluation platform for MRI reconstruction and image post processing techniques."

By 2060, the burden of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the U.S. is expected to double to
13.9 million, with women being overrepresented among cases. However, many powerful aspects of women’s
lives–including exposure to gender-based violence–have received almost no attention in ADRD research.
Women’s exposure to gender-based violence, particularly intimate partner violence (IPV), is pervasive; nearly
30% of older women have experienced IPV in their lifetime.
Preliminary evidence suggests that IPV is associated with accelerated biological aging and decreased
cognitive functioning, but samples are often highly selected, sample sizes are limited, and studies lack
longitudinal assessments. Stress sensitization models also suggest that the impact of trauma, such as IPV,
may be larger in some subgroups, since trauma and stress in early life are hypothesized to increase sensitivity
to stressful and/or traumatic experiences in later life, but such models have not been extended to neurologic
aging outcomes such as cognitive decline. However, data sources that contain robust measures on IPV and
longitudinal cognition are limited and often not population representative, limiting the external validity of study
results. Modern transportability methods from causal inference may provide novel opportunities to extrapolate
study results across populations, improving external validity at the population level.
The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate a long-term, aging-related health consequence of IPV among
cis-gender women–cognitive decline–an early indicator of ADRD risk using data from longitudinal subcohorts
of the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS2) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). This work will be achieved
through three specific aims: to estimate (aim 1) the effect of experiences of IPV on trajectories of cognitive
functioning in midlife, to evaluate (aim 2) whether experiences of childhood trauma modify the effect of
experiences of IPV on trajectories of cognitive functioning in midlife, and to address (aim 3) the non-
representative nature of the NHS2 cohort by utilizing novel transportability methods developed in causal
inference to estimate the population effect of experiences of IPV on trajectories of cognitive functioning in
midlife using HRS. This work will address critical public health questions on the lifecourse consequences of
IPV among cis-gender women, bringing analysis of lifecourse and gender into ADRD research, and will provide
methodologic contributions to ADRD research to address sample limitations frequent in this field.
Further, this fellowship will provide individualized training in gender-based violence, social relationships and
networks, cognitive functioning, and methods for causal transportability alongside direct mentorship from an
exceptional team of researchers. This work is poised to contribute both substantively and methodologically to
the literature on ADRD and may help reveal how lifecourse social experiences of women influence ADRD risk."
10762991,"Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation can provide durable HIV elimination as exemplified in the “Berlin”
patient, the “London” patient, and recently, in a third (“New York”) patient. This gives a strong rationale for HSC
gene therapy of HIV/AIDS. Current clinical HSC gene therapy protocols (e.g. for hemoglobinopathies) involve
high-dose chemotherapy to make space in the bone marrow, and the transplantation of HSCs after ex vivo gene
transfer. Because of the risk, cost, and technical complexity, it is unlikely that ex vivo protocols will be widely
applicable, specifically in developing countries where the greatest demand for HIV/AIDS therapy lies. We have
developed an in vivo HSC transduction approach that requires only intravenous injections and could be provided
as an outpatient treatment. In this approach, HSCs are mobilized from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood
stream and transduced with intravenously injected in vivo gene transfer vectors (helper-dependent adenovirus
vectors) that target receptors present on primitive HSCs. HSCs transduced in the periphery return to the bone
marrow, persist there long-term, and contribute to all blood cell lineages. The central goal of this application is
to further develop our in vivo approach toward HIV prophylaxis and therapy with persistent eradication of HIV in
target/reservoir cells. The Specific aims are. 1. Optimize HSC mobilization regimens, HSC homing, and HDAd
vectors/expression systems to achieve i) efficient bone marrow homing of mobilized HSCs, ii) efficient trafficking
of transduced HSC progeny cells, specifically to the brain, a main HIV reservoir tissue that is difficult to target by
therapeutics, and iii) increase the level and safety of transgene expression. 2. Prevent HIV/SIV escape mutants
and eliminate virus from reservoirs by a multi-modular in vivo HSC gene therapy approach. Modules will exert
anti-HIV activity based on different mechanisms (e.g. opsonization of virus in blood by eCD4-Ig, protection of
target cells by co-receptor knockout through in vivo genome editing, and killing of infected cells independently of
MHC-I presentation by a CD4 chimeric antigen receptor (CD4-CAR) expressed on immune effector cells. 3.
Demonstrate in NHPs that the optimized in vivo HSC gene therapy approach will allow for i) complete protection
against SIV challenges (absence of escape mutants) and ii) SIV elimination in infected animals (including the
brain). Model systems to test the safety and antiviral efficacy of the approaches will include primary HSCs/HSC-
derived cells, transgenic and humanized mouse models (with and without SIV infection), as well as NHPs (in
prophylaxis and therapy setting). Our efforts will address important biological obstacles in HIV therapy in the
context of a technically simple, cost-efficient, and portable approach."

 Racial/ethnic disparities in diet and obesity are remarkably consistent across U.S. cities. First, we will use
group model building to systematically engage academic, policy, and community stakeholders to build capacity
for systems thinking, develop and refine a “map” of the multilevel factors that drive diet disparities, and identify
policy levers to reduce diet disparities in cities. The need for this work is motivated by the lack of an existing
conceptual framework that explicates mechanisms via which obesogenic environments and systematic
structural disadvantage disproportionately affect minorities and lead to disparities. Previous research and
existing conceptual frameworks have identified myriad influences on diet among the general population, but a
more specific conceptual framework can advance understanding of social, environmental, and policy factors
that work in combination to constrain healthy food choices of Blacks, Latinos, and other racial/ethnic minorities.
 Second, we will implement an agent-based simulation model (ABM) to examine how residential segregation,
the inequitable distribution of food outlets, the lower price of unhealthy foods, and income inequality work in
combination to constrain food choices of racial/ethnic minorities and lead to diet and obesity disparities. The
ABM bridges lines of research conducted by our group and others that have used ABM to examine how food
access and food prices separately affect diets. By integrating these separate modeling paradigms, we can
examine how diet disparities emerge due to intersecting disadvantage in food access and affordability. In the
ABM, individual-agents in a virtual city make a series of daily decisions about where to shop for food, what
types of food to purchase, and what to eat. Each decision is based on simple rules that reflect influences on
food purchasing and diet, including household food budgets; travel costs to food stores; between-store
variation in price, inventory, and quality; and the prices of 12 nutritionally important food categories (e.g.,
protein, whole grains) and 6 beverage categories. We use gold standard data regarding household income and
food spending, food prices and purchasing, and diet. We propose two uses for the ABM: First, we will assess
the impact of job and income loss related to the COVID-19 pandemic and federal policies that restrict eligibility
and enrollment of immigrants in food assistance programs – both of which have a disproportionate effect on
minorities and thus are likely to exacerbate disparities. Second, we will engage policy stakeholders to inform
dissemination and evaluate how scaling up existing pilot programs (e.g., healthy food delivery, multiplying the
value of SNAP dollars spent at farmers’ markets, increasing healthy food access in minority neighborhoods)
and implementing current policy proposals (e.g., USDA proposal to replace SNAP with “harvest boxes”) will
exacerbate or reduce diet disparities. The ABM is grounded in the Philadelphia context, but the research
questions and findings are highly relevant to diet disparities in essentially all U.S. cities."
10814302,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
HIV/AIDS is at epidemic proportions in Zambia, where approximately 1.2 million people – representing about
12% of the country's adult population – are infected. Concomitant with this epidemic, the widespread
availability of free anti-retroviral treatment in-country has increased the lifespan of HIV-1 infected individuals,
resulting in prolonged chronic immunosuppression and increased occurrence of HIV-associated cancers.
However, in-country efforts to prevent, diagnose, and manage cancer in Zambia have been hindered by a lack
of laboratory facilities, insufficient cancer research infrastructure, and a shortage of trained personnel.
Recognizing these critical gaps, the University of Zambia School of Medicine, the University Teaching
Hospitals, and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln leveraged the success of a previous Fogarty partnership to
establish the AIDS Malignancies Training and Research International Program (AMTRIP) in collaboration with
a new lead partner, the Cancer Diseases Hospital (CDH). This unique program aims to enhance Zambia's
cancer research infrastructure and capacity by training Zambian biomedical researchers and health care
providers in laboratory techniques and research methodology related to basic cancer biology, molecular
genomics, and bioinformatics. Now in its fifth year, AMTRIP has made significant strides by providing intensive
long-term graduate degree training and short- and medium-term technical training for a diverse group of 25
trainees; hosting workshops for over 300 health care professionals; successfully transitioning trainees into
mentorship roles; adapting program activities to meet the needs of trainees and the rapidly changing cancer
research landscape; and leveraging partnerships with other D43 programs to expand the program's impact.
Building on these accomplishments, this renewal application seeks to further enhance cancer research
capacity in Zambia by: 1) continuing to provide long-term academic instruction and research experiences for
eight current master's and three current PhD students in Zambia and recruiting four additional master's and
two additional PhD students; 2) providing medium-term (six months to one year) technical training for trainees
in topics related to molecular pathology, cancer biology, bioinformatics and genomics; and 3) delivering short-
term training (less than three months) and technical workshops (3-5 days) designed to enhance basic, clinical,
implementation, genomics, bioinformatics, and behavioral cancer research in collaboration with other regional
partners and programs. Expected outcomes of this renewal include the graduation of eight current master's
and three current PhD candidates; recruitment and training of an additional four master's and two PhD

10768755,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) and is the leading cause of disability in young adults, afflicting some 400,000 U.S. citizens and generating an economic burden of approximately $10 billion annually. MS results from an incompletely understood interaction between genetic and environmental factors that triggers an autoimmune response against CNS myelin. Chronic CNS inflammation induces pro-inflammatory programs in CNS-resident cells such as astrocytes and microglia, which are not responsive to the therapeutic approaches currently available for MS. Astrocytes are abundant CNS-resident cells which participate in multiple aspects of CNS homeostasis in health and disease, including pro-inflammatory signaling in the context of MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Thus, the study of the mechanisms that regulate astrocyte pro-inflammatory activities may identify mechanisms of disease pathogenesis in MS, as well as novel efficacious therapies, particularly for its progressive phase. In previous studies focused on environmental factors in MS, we identified a signaling pathway in astrocytes that is controlled by environmental pollutants, and drives astrocyte pathogenic activities that promote inflammation and neurodegeneration in EAE and MS. Specifically, we found that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized receptor SigmaR1 stabilizes the inositol requiring enzyme 1-alpha (IRE1a), leading to the activation of the transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) which promotes pro-inflammatory gene expression in astrocytes. In genetic perturbation studies we demonstrated that SigmaR1-driven IRE1a-XBP1 activation boosts the expression of pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic transcriptional programs in astrocytes such as Nos2, Ccl2, Il6, Csf2 (GM-CSF), and Csf2ra (the GM-CSF receptor) during EAE. Moreover, we detected increased IRE1a-XBP1 activation in astrocytes localized to MS lesions. I hypothesize that SigmaR1-IRE1a- XBP1 signaling drives astrocyte pathogenic activities in EAE and MS. Thus, I propose the following Aims: AIM 1: Mentored phase (K99). Define astrocyte subpopulations driven by SigmaR1-IRE1a-XBP1 signaling (XBP1+ astrocytes) in both EAE (Aim 1.1) and MS (Aim 1.2) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). AIM 2: Mentored phase (K99). Test the therapeutic potential of suppressing XBP1 signaling with clinically- relevant SigmaR1 inhibitors using EAE mouse models (Aims 2.1-2.2), and scRNA-seq (Aim 2.3).

10842254,"Summary
Within a cell, a number of pathways contribute to the repair and clearance of proteins and
are required for maintaining protein homeostasis (proteostasis). A common feature of
proteostatic pathways is their ability to act on a range of client proteins that vary based on
cellular and environmental conditions. The molecular mechanisms of the selectivity of many
proteostatic pathways remain incompletely understood. The overall goal of our research
program is to investigate the mechanisms that determine the selectivity of proteostatic
pathways by conducting functional analyses on proteome-wide scales. As a first step
towards this long-term objective, we have focused on investigating the global selectivities of
the macroautophagy pathway and methionine sulfoxide reductases.
Macroautophagy can selectively target specific proteins and organelles for lysosomic
degradation. Using novel proteomic approaches, we have identified subsets of proteins that
rely on macroautophagy for their constitutive turnover. We have also shown that selective
autophagic degradation plays a major role in maintaining protein homeostasis in quiescent
cells and that alterations in autophagic flux is a pathologic feature of prion infected cells.
Our future research will focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms of the
differential selectivity of basal macroautophagy and investigating the prevalence and
regulation of selective macroautophagy in quiescent and prion infected cells.
The methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) system is an important repair pathway for
oxidized methionine residues in proteins. To facilitate global analyses of the selectivity of
Msrs, we have developed novel proteomic approaches for accurate quantitation of
methionine oxidation on proteome-wide scales. Using these approaches, we plan to
investigate the extent of methionine oxidation in proteomes of cells and tissues that are
deficient in specific Msrs under normal and oxidative stress conditions.
Together, the proposed experiments will provide insights into the mechanisms of client
selection by macroautophagy and Msr pathways. Our studies will also examine the role of
these two pathways in mitigating protein damage that occurs under specific proteotoxic
stress conditions."

The Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the University of Washington has trained 158
physician-scientists through continuous funding provided by this training grant since its inception in 1976. More
than 75% of trainees have taken academic or research positions and this track record has been maintained.
Many former trainees have achieved leadership positions, with 5 of the former trainees becoming Dean or
Associate Dean of Medical Schools, 3 Chair of Medicine, and 13 Chief of Division. Thirty-six have become full
Professor, 11 are leaders in pharmaceutical companies, and 3 have served as Directors of Divisions or major
Programs at the CDC. Trainees that have finished in the past 15 years have had remarkable early success in
research careers, including >50% achieving research funding, 26% with K awards, and 98% publishing one or
more papers related to their supported research. The continuing objective of the program is to provide post-
doctoral training for physician-scientists committed to a research career in infectious diseases. Eight
postdoctoral training stipends per year are requested, the same number as in the previous funding period.
There are currently 49 participating mentors with $163 million annual direct research funding and outstanding
mentorship records. Each trainee selects a mentor (or more than one) for detailed research training in one of
six research tracks including Virology, TB, Immunology, Emerging Infectious Diseases, Bacterial Pathogenesis
and the Microbiome, and Epidemiology/Clinical Trials. All trainees are assigned a mentoring committee that
meets at least annually and evaluates the trainee. All trainees complete a core curriculum consisting of
required didactic, research and clinical activities. Many trainees elect to take formal course work at the
University of Washington and an average of 2-3 a year seek an MPH or MS degree. The program generally
requires three years of training, one clinical year supported by the hospitals and two research years supported
by this training grant."

This application, responsive to PAR-17-290, seeks R25 funding for “Advancing Native
American Diversity in Aging Research through Undergraduate Education.” By offering
annual courses and mentored research—along with online virtual education and mentoring during
this COVID-19 pandemic—we recruit students from Native American backgrounds, both urban
and non-urban, to encourage them to pursue careers investigating Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias (ADRD) and aging mechanisms, and help to launch their scientific careers.
The ADRD and aging fields continue to grow swiftly, as does the elderly population, yet there are
too few laboratories led by under-represented minority (URM) scientists, let alone Native
American PIs, and too few new URM trainees. This R25 is directed by Gerald Schatten, PhD
(Pitt), and Laura Niedernhofer, MD, PhD (Minnesota), who join David Burgess, PhD (Cherokee,
Boston College); Melissa Wells, PhD (Bois Forte & Couchiching First Nation Anishinaabe, Johns
Hopkins - Duluth); Paul Robbins, PhD (Minnesota); and Calvin Simerly, PhD (Pitt) as the
Executive Committee. The course is held at Minnesota’s Institute on the Biology of Aging and
Metabolism, directed by Laura Niedernhofer, MD, PhD, and Paul Robbins, PhD. Daily lectures,
active learning, and extended discussions on emerging concepts, followed by lab and group
exercises and informal seminars are held over a week (August 15-21, 2021). Both hands-on and
online training for 16 participants on recent discoveries regarding ADRD’s root causes and
treatments is presented, with special attention devoted to Native Americans; the biology of aging
is also considered. Frequent interactions are maintained with each trainee afterwards, to evaluate
the course and provide ongoing mentoring. Conducted with sensitivity to tribal histories, five
specific aims are proposed: I. Provide conceptual education and research training in ADRD and
the Biology of Aging, with relevance for Native American trainees; II. Support mentored pilot
research, especially involving challenges in health disparities and diversity related to Native
Americans; III. Encourage trainees’ and alumni’s longer-term career planning through personal
coaching, mentoring sessions, and peer-to-peer advice; IV. Discuss NIH regulatory requirements
within the context of Tribal Sovereignty; and V. Evaluate, improve, and monitor the Native
American ADAR’s strengths and avoid weaknesses with unbiased, quantitative, independent
mechanisms which track trainees’ and alumni’s achievements to ensure that the program is a
wise, cost-effective investment. In so doing, we will enhance and expand the research careers of
promising trainees, especially Native Americans, to help ensure full diversity in the NIA and NIH."
10819477,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Sepsis is defined as a dysregulated host inflammatory response that occurs due to life-threatening
infection with the presence of organ dysfunction. Sepsis is the most frequent cause of mortality in most
intensive care units and is responsible for over a quarter million deaths in the United States annually. The
incidence of sepsis is increasing because of the aging population and the associated weakening of the immune
system that occurs in the aged. Until recently, most research on sepsis was focused on blocking the initial
hyper-inflammatory cytokine-mediated phase of the disorder. Improved treatment protocols have resulted in
most patients surviving this initial hyper-inflammatory phase of sepsis and entering a protracted
immunosuppressive phase. The majority of deaths in sepsis occur during this immunosuppressive phase of the
disorder. Deaths in this immunosuppressive phase of sepsis are typically due to failure to control the primary
infection or a result of acquisition of secondary hospital-acquired infections, often with opportunistic pathogens
thereby underscoring the host’s impaired immunity. The reactivation of multiple latent viruses including
cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus that occurs in patients with protracted sepsis further attests to the
profound degree of immunosuppression in these patients. There is a growing body of evidence in animal
studies as well as data from small phase II clinical trials indicating that therapies which boost the host immune
system can improve morbidity and mortality in sepsis. This immuno-therapeutic based approach to sepsis has
been the focus of the principal investigator for over two decades. The current proposal is an extension of these
investigations.
 The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify molecular mechanisms of immunosuppression in
sepsis and develop new immuno-adjuvant therapies that restore host immunity, ameliorate organ injury, and
improve survival in sepsis. We are focusing on testing immune modulatory agents that have an excellent safety
profile and are in current clinical trials. Successful completion of this study would enable rapid translation of
newly identified drugs into clinical trials in sepsis and offer a new way forward against this heretofore
intractable disease."

Important progress in curbing the progression of the HIV epidemic has been achieved, but new HIV infection
rates are outpacing the targets set by global health organizations: in 2019, an estimated 1.7 million people
became newly HIV infected worldwide. New HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) strategies are needed
urgently to overcome this alarming prevention gap. Adherence to daily dosing regimens has been a critical
impediment to success in previous HIV PrEP clinical trials with antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in susceptible,
uninfected individuals. This challenge can be mitigated with sustained release, or long-acting, ARV
formulations that reduce dosing frequency to intervals of once per month or longer and target the
heterogeneous populations most at risk from contracting HIV. An injectable sustained release nanoparticle
formulation of the ARV drug cabotegravir recently has been approved by the US FDA for HIV PrEP, but this
technology suffers from a number of drawbacks: a high initial concentration burst; the particles cannot be
removed following injection should there be an adverse reaction; pharmacokinetic (PK) tail-phase where sub-
therapeutic systemic drug concentrations can persist for over 1 year after the last injection. Subdermal
implants with a duration of use of six months or longer are being developed for HIV PrEP using a single agent;
however, effective strategies likely will require two ARV drugs. This biomedical challenge is exacerbated by the
scarcity of safe, efficacious FDA-approved available agents with sufficient potency to enable a feasible implant
size and a period of use of six months, or longer. The proposed efforts build on our previous successful
accomplishments in developing sustained release drug delivery biomedical technologies and will test the
central hypothesis that an innovative subdermal implant system delivering two, new potent ARV agents will
demonstrate initial feasibility in terms of drug biophysicochemical properties and expected duration of use. In
Aim 1, we will design, synthesize, and screen a library of novel prodrugs based on established, FDA-approved
agents from different mechanistic classes. Lead candidates will be selected rationally using a decision tree
based on clearly defined, quantitative rules. In Aim 2, promising prodrug candidates will be formulated for
sustained delivery using our next-generation subdermal implant system, and these efforts will be guided by
user preference research conducted in South Africa to fine-tune modifiable device attributes. In Aim 3, we will
conduct PK and safety studies in mice and sheep, followed by efficacy studies in humanized mice to determine
if the devices can safely prevent vaginal and rectal HIV infection. The project builds on an established
collaboration of highly experienced investigators and will advance our scientific knowledge on the many,
interrelated aspects of systemic, sustained drug delivery for HIV prevention."

Physiological transport of fluid, molecules, proteins, and cells throughout the body is critical for homeostasis.
While transport processes like cell migration and molecular passage across cellular barriers are well
documented, less is known about transport across the interstitial tissue spaces and into lymphatic vessels.
Lymphatic vessels are critical for maintenance of tissue homeostasis and forming the adaptive immune
response, as they are the natural conduit between peripheral tissues and the lymph nodes (LNs), where the
immune response is shaped. Because particulates are primarily shuttled via lymphatic vessels, lymphatics have
received considerable attention in recent years as potential targets for drug delivery, particularly for immune
modulation. Transport across interstitial tissue governs what enters lymphatic vessels vs. blood vessels and thus
understanding extracellular tissues is vital to design therapeutics. However, we do not yet fully understand how
physiological processes and conditions such as interstitial flow or inflammation affect transport across interstitial
tissue spaces and into lymphatics. My research program will answer two key questions: 1) How do
physiological processes affect 1) lymphatic transport and its regulation, and 2) transport across
extracellular tissue? To address the first question, we propose to develop physiologically relevant in vitro model
systems that can recapitulate conditions within peripheral tissues and nanoparticle tools that both allow probing
how specific mechanisms, including fluid flow and inflammation, modulate lymphatic transport specifically.
Results from these studies will provide new insights into regulation of lymphatic transport, new model systems
for studying lymphatic transport, and new design criteria to maximize targeting lymphatic transport for therapeutic
purposes. To address the second question, we will combine two techniques: multiple particle tracking (MPT) and
live ex vivo tissue slice cultures. MPT uses nanoparticle diffusion over time to extract information about tissue
mesh spacing or microrheology and provides a medium for studying physiological processes like flow. Live tissue
slice cultures maintain tissue structure ex vivo and allow for real-time assessment of interstitial tissue structures.
Results from combining these techniques will provide a better understanding of how physiological processes
affect extracellular spaces and provide insights into design criteria for therapeutics to cross extracellular tissue
barriers. In summary, the proposed work will advance our knowledge about physiological processes governing
lymphatic transport and its regulation, and also shed light into how processes like inflammation, interstitial flow,
and edema affect extracellular tissue spaces. Ultimately, the vision for my lab’s research is to design crucial
scientific methods to be used by the broader community, identify design criteria and computational
models to predict transport across biological barriers, and design therapeutics and their delivery
vehicles for treating diseases by harnessing lymphatic vessel physiology."
10834184,"We will test the hypothesis that the typical worsening of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes (DM) will
be reduced by keeping glucose normal compared to usual care.
 Progression of hyperglycemia is mediated by loss of β-cell function, which will be mitigated by
normalizing glucose, reducing the “excitotoxicity” leading to β-cell dedifferentiation and apoptosis. In multiple
studies, when lifestyle change or Rx reduced progression from PreDM to DM, there was no “catch-up” after the
interventions ended – cumulative DM remained less than in controls, consistent with a change in the natural
history. Reaching normal glucose is beneficial regardless of the mechanism: in the Diabetes Prevention
Program (DPP), PreDM subjects who achieved normal glucose levels only once, had 56% less DM in the DPP
Outcomes Study (DPPOS) – similar in lifestyle change, metformin, and control groups.
 This study will be novel, but the approach will be easy to translate into practice: 1) Aim for normal
glucose, instead of testing an Rx or mechanisms. 2) Start early in the natural history, allowing use of Rx
with a very low risk of hypoglycemia. 3) Target early DM instead of PreDM, using Rx already FDA approved
for DM. 4) Use accelerated stepped intensification of Rx to keep glucose normal with intensive Rx.
Aims: assess effect size, β-cell function, retinopathy, nephropathy, CGM, and cost-effectiveness.
 Methods: We will study 126 adults, 1/3 each in 3 groups of early DM (A1c 6.0-6.9%, no Rx; A1c 6.0-6.9%
on metformin; A1c 7.0-7.4%, on metformin). After a 2-week run-in [to establish tolerance to metformin (if not
on it already), and adherence to self monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)], all subjects will have lifestyle
change support; HbA1c and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) every 3 months; and be randomized 1:1, to
intensive Rx: adding Rx if SMBG levels are > goal (<100 mg/dl premeal, <130 postmeal, total 7 tests/week) at
least 3x/week for 2 weeks in a row after ≥4 weeks of maximum tolerated dosage (MTD) of each Rx: metformin
(if not on it at baseline) + TZD pioglitazone + GLP-1 RA semaglutide + SGLT2 empagliflozin + glargine U300
insulin; or control Rx: in the same order, based on A1c every 3 months: metformin if ≥7.0%, other Rx if ≥7.5%.
Outcomes: Over 2.5 years, plus a 3-month washout, we will quantitate i) effect size – differences in
HbA1c with intensive Rx vs. controls; and (ii) β-cell function, primarily using 3-hour OGTTs with modeling as
in RISE, since trends with intensive Rx vs. controls post-washout may indicate whether β-cell function is likely
to be sustained. We will also explore (iii) retinopathy (by blinded grading of fundus photos); (iv) nephropathy
(microalbuminuria and eGFR); (v) whether 14 days of CGM could be substituted for SMBG in identifying the
need to add another Rx (since CGM might be easier to use in primary care), and (vi) cost-effectiveness.
 Impact: A positive study will lead to a change in medical practice, since early diagnosis and normalizing
glucose should produce longterm benefits, including reduced diabetes complications, mortality, and costs."

Since 2009, the South Carolina Clinical and Translational Research Institute (SCTR) has transformed the
research environment across South Carolina (SC) by creating a Learning Health System that supports high-
quality clinical and translational research (CTR) and fosters collaboration and innovation. Headquartered at the
Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), SCTR has engaged stakeholders and created statewide
partnerships to improve care and address social determinants of health across SC. However, greater than 75%
of SC is rural, and all 46 counties contain areas designated as medically underserved, so health disparities
remain an issue. Over the next five years, SCTR will strengthen its outreach to these medically underserved
areas through collaboration with the Clemson University Health Extension Program and the MUSC Telehealth
Center of Excellence. With a focus on implementation and dissemination as well as discovery, we will develop
and demonstrate innovative technologies and outreach to improve the health of our stakeholders. We will build
on prior successes and introduce innovative approaches to expand CTR across SC through the following aims:
Aim 1. Extend and enhance high-quality, innovative, flexible curricula and training experiences for all levels of
the CTR workforce, with particular emphasis on enhancing workforce heterogeneity and team science.
Aim 2. Engage a diverse group of stakeholders as active partners in CTR to address health care priorities
while enhancing the scientific knowledge base about collaboration and engagement.
Aim 3. Promote greater inclusion across the full translational spectrum of research by engaging investigators
from many disciplines and patient populations from diverse demographic backgrounds and geographic areas.
Aim 4. Develop, demonstrate and disseminate innovative methods and processes to address barriers and
accelerate the translation of research discoveries to improvements in human health that can be generalized to
a variety of practice settings.
Aim 5. Enhance the conduct of translational research through the development of secure and innovative
informatics and digital health solutions, tools and methodologies that affect every aspect of CTR.
SCTR’s vision is to be a major force in facilitating the translation of innovative science into practice to address
the health priorities of the citizens of SC and beyond. To achieve this vision, SCTR’s mission is to catalyze the
development of methods and technologies that lead to more efficient translation of biomedical discoveries into
interventions that improve individual and public health. SCTR will serve as the statewide academic home for
CTR, one that is well-integrated with SC’s healthcare systems and provides essential support for innovative,
efficient, multidisciplinary research and research training. We will work within SCTR, with our partners across
SC and with the CTSA Consortium to realize this vision.

10832629,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The number of Americans with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is projected to reach 13.8
million by 2050. Given the current lack of disease-modifying treatments for ADRD coupled with evidence that
ADRD develops over decades, there is growing interest in developing prevention strategies. Middle age (i.e.,
45-64 years) is increasingly recognized as a key life course period to target modifiable risk factors for cognitive
decline and ADRD. Prior studies have identified individual-level risk factors in middle age, including chronic
conditions such as hypertension and obesity and health-related behaviors such as excessive alcohol use. The
2020 Lancet Commission estimated that addressing these mid-life risk factors could result in up to 15% of
dementias being prevented or delayed. However, recent data suggests the need to look beyond individual-
level factors to examine the potential role of environmental exposures to improve health outcomes in mid-life
and reduce overall dementia burden. Since 1990, the prevalence of chronic conditions that are risk factors for
ADRD has increased in middle-aged adults, particularly in individuals with lower socioeconomic status (SES).
The reasons for these trends are not yet fully understood, but a leading hypothesis is that lower SES in middle
age is leading to premature onset of aging-related conditions through exposures in the social and physical
environment (e.g., levels of social support, crime, food insecurity, pollution). A growing number of studies have
linked such environmental factors to risk of cognitive decline and ADRD in older adults, and these factors could
also be impacting cognitive trajectories and risk of ADRD in middle age. However, key knowledge gaps
remain. First, it is unknown if cognitive outcomes are worsening in middle-aged adults, nor if environmental
exposures increase the risk of cognitive decline in middle age. Additionally, whereas cognitive decline and
ADRD in older adults result from the interplay of environmental and genetic risk factors, it is unclear how
genetic risk contributes to cognitive decline in middle age. A longitudinal study of middle-aged adults that
includes measures of environmental exposures and genetic data is needed to address these questions. The
objective of the proposed project is to examine if cognitive outcomes are worsening in middle age and how
environmental and genetic risk factors contribute to cognitive decline in this age group. The specific aims are
to: (1) examine the epidemiology of cognitive impairment in middle-aged adults in the U.S., including identifying
cognitive trajectories and incidence of “cognitive impairment no dementia” (CIND) over time; (2) determine if
environmental and genetic factors predict cognitive trajectories and incident CIND; and (3) replicate our
analyses in a second dataset. We will complete these aims using longitudinal nationally representative data
from the NIA-funded Health and Retirement Study. Findings will help elucidate the burden and mechanisms of
cognitive decline in middle age and inform policy planning to mitigate the projected burden of dementia."
10834162,"Chemicals produced by living systems, or natural products, have had a tremendous impact on human health.
For example, nearly one third of all small molecule drugs approved by a regulatory agency over the past nearly
four decades have been natural products or derivatives of natural products, including over 70% of antibiotics and
40% of anticancer drugs [1]. While very useful molecules have been identified among the hundreds of thousands
of natural products that have been characterized to date, genome sequencing efforts over the past decade and
a half have revealed that we have only characterized the products of a small fraction of the biosynthetic pathways
that exist in nature. The products of these pathways have the potential to greatly impact the diagnosis and
treatment of disease, and it is critical that we develop new approaches to accelerate the identification and
characterization of new natural products and natural product-like compounds.
 Towards this critical need, my group focuses on the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified
peptide (RiPP) class of natural products [2], and the enzymes involved in their biosynthesis. Unique among
natural product biosynthetic pathways, the substrate of the RiPP biosynthetic enzymes is a genetically encoded
precursor peptide. This feature of the substrates allows for deep mutational analysis, not just of the enzymes,
but of their substrates as well. We will develop a platform for high throughput examination of the substrate
selectivity and activity of RiPP biosynthetic enzymes based on yeast or bacterial surface display, fluorescence
activated cell sorting, and next generation sequencing. Using this platform and gene libraries encoding substrate
variants we will study the substrate scope of these enzymes, and how that scope relates to the sequence of the
native substrate of the enzymes. Additionally, we will perform deep mutational analysis of the enzymes to identify
contributions to substrate recognition and selectivity. These studies will provide us with a deeper understanding
of how these enzymes function. With this deeper understanding, we will be able to use these enzymes as tools
to generate large libraries of natural product-like compounds that can be screened to identify those with useful
biological activities more efficiently than current natural product discovery approaches."
10871796,"SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing health concern and is the most common type of dementia worldwide.
Veterans who have been prisoners of war have a 50% greater risk to develop dementia later in life, a percentage
that becomes even higher in veterans who develop posttraumatic stress disorder. Evidence indicates that mental
illness and neurological and nervous system disorders can increase the risk of developing osteoporosis leading
to high prevalence of bone fractures. Fractures, in particular of the hip, have been associated with increased
mortality, especially in the elderly. Conversely, osteoporosis is associated with increased risk of dementia diag-
nosis. In spite all this evidence, a direct link between dementia and osteoporosis, frequently occurring with aging,
has never been conclusively demonstrated. Interestingly, some genetic mutations are risk factors for both AD
and osteoporosis. As an example, mutations of the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2)
is expressed in microglia in brain and in osteoclasts in bone correlate with AD and dementia, and with bone
fragility. Recent studies led by Dr. Landreth, a Consultant in this application, showed that mice expressing the
R47H TREM2 variant (TREM2R47H/+ mice) exhibit loss of TREM2 function and neuritic dystrophy. However, the
mechanisms responsible for the TREM2 mutation effects on bone mass and strength are completely unclear. In
our preliminary findings, we showed that aged 13-month-old female TREM2R47H/+ mice exhibit a skeletal pheno-
type, with decreased cortical and cancellous bone mass and cortical bone biomechanical properties. In addition,
female, but not male showed reduced bone mineral density accrual between 1 and 12 months of age. Work of
others showed that low bone mass in TREM2-/- mice is ascribed to low osteoclast β-catenin activation, suggesting
defective canonical Wnt signaling in the absence of TREM2 function. Consistent with this possibility, expression
of Wnt target genes cyclin D1 and Cx43 in tibia is lower in TREM2R47H/+ compared to WT mice, whereas cyclin
D1, Lef1 and Axin2 expression is reduced in osteoclastic cells derived from bone marrow cells isolated from
TREM2R47H/+ mice. On the other hand, osteoclastic constitutive β-catenin activation or expression of a high bone
mass (HMB) LRP5 mutant decreased osteoclasts and increased bone mass in mice. Yet, the cellular and mo-
lecular mechanisms for the changes in the bone mass and composition in TREM2R47H/+ mice remain unknown.
Further, the role of low Wnt signaling on the skeletal effect of the TREM2 variant has not been tested. Based on
our preliminary studies and on published evidence we propose that reduced Wnt/β-catenin signaling due to
abnormal TREM2 function leads to increased osteoclastic bone resorption and results in skeletal defi-
ciencies. To test this hypothesis we will 1. Investigate whether abnormal TREM2 function worsens the conse-
quences of sex steroid removal in male and female adult mice, 2. Determine whether deletion of osteoclastic
TREM2 is sufficient to elicit the skeletal phenotype observed in TREM2R47H/+ mice, and 3. Determine the role of
osteoclastic Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the bone phenotype resulting from TREM2 deficiency. Successful com-
pletion of these studies will widen our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of the skeletal defects
in mice with increased susceptibility to develop AD. Further, it might set the basis for treatments to improve both
the cognitive and skeletal deficits in AD patients."

Older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias and limited-English proficiency (LEP) are at
high risk of receiving suboptimal, goal-discordant care because of language and cultural barriers to effective
communication about goals of care. Palliative care provides a way to improve quality of life and facilitate goal-
concordant care by supporting effective person-family-clinician communication, but is under-utilized by older
adults with Dementia and LEP and their families. No studies have sought to identify targets for intervention to
address barriers to palliative care at multiple levels (i.e., patient/family, clinician, system, and community-
levels) for this vulnerable population. Addressing this gap will be essential for the development of effective
interventions to improve the quality of care for older adults with Dementia and LEP. The long-term goal of this
work is to develop, evaluate, and disseminate interventions to facilitate culturally-sensitive palliative care for
older adults with Dementia and LEP and their families. The rationale for this study is that before effective
culturally- and linguistically-appropriate interventions to improve palliative care for older adults with Dementia
and LEP can be developed, quantitative and qualitative data is needed to evaluate the scope of existing
inequities and identify modifiable multi-level barriers to the delivery of high-quality palliative care for this
population. Aim 1 utilizes quantitative methods to compare the quality of care received by decedents with
advanced Dementia and LEP to those with English proficiency in four key palliative care domains (utilization of
care, documentation of patient goals and preferences, symptom assessment, and circumstances of death)
using EHR-based quality metrics and novel machine learning methods. Aim 2 utilizes qualitative interviews
with key stakeholders (older adults with Dementia and LEP and their family members, caseworker-cultural
mediators and interpreters, and clinicians and administrators) to identify modifiable targets for intervention
across multiple levels. Aim 3 utilizes qualitative interviews with leaders of community-based organizations to
assess community-level resources and capacity to support high quality palliative care for older adults with
Dementia and LEP. Our interdisciplinary team is experienced in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia
research, community engagement with LEP populations, and quantitative and qualitative methods. The
proposal is innovative because it evaluates multi-level barriers to palliative care across three diverse LEP
populations (Latinx, Chinese, and Vietnamese), and uses machine learning methods to evaluate the quality of
care across several palliative care domains in a large health system. The proposed research is significant
because these data will enable the identification and prioritization of multi-level targets for the development of
culturally and linguistically-appropriate interventions to improve palliative care for older adults with Dementia
and LEP. Ultimately, this work will advance a model of care that facilitates goal-concordant, high-quality care
for older adults with Dementia and LEP and supports the palliative care needs of their family members."

The incidence of stimulant use disorder (SUD) in the United States is on the rise. Notably, no FDA-approved
medications exist to treat SUD. Cocaine and methamphetamine (METH) are the primary stimulants used by
individuals with SUD. Because those stimulants exert their effects via monoamine transporters (MATs),
interventions that modulate MAT function could be effective SUD treatments. Our group identified the brain-
expressed protein RGS12 as being a modulator of monoamine transporters, and RGS proteins are thought to
be druggable targets. Thus, my first aim (my dissertation research project) is to evaluate RGS12 inhibition as a
potential treatment strategy for SUD using a mouse model of the disease. Our group discovered that mice lacking
RGS12 function are resistant to the locomotor-activating effects of various stimulants, including 3,4-
methylendedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). My early dissertation work focused on understanding why RGS12-
null mice are resistant to MDMA-induced hyperlocomotion. As MDMA’s primary target is the serotonin transporter
(SERT), I hypothesized that SERT was dysregulated in RGS12-null mice. To test my hypothesis, I measured
SERT expression and function using brain tissue from wild-type and RGS12-null mice. I discovered that,
compared with wild-type mice, RGS12-null mice exhibited increases in SERT expression and function. Given
that loss of RGS12 in mice is accompanied by increased expression and function of SERT (my finding) and the
dopamine transporter (DAT; a previous graduate student’s finding), and because cocaine targets both SERT
and DAT, I hypothesized that RGS12-null mice would be resistant to cocaine withdrawal-associated behaviors.
To test my hypothesis, I assessed previously reported somatic signs of cocaine withdrawal in wild-type and
RGS12-null mice. My results showed that while wild-type mice display increased grooming during cocaine
withdrawal, RGS12-null mice do not. In the F99 training phase, I will continue my efforts to validate RGS12 as a
target for SUD by measuring cocaine or METH intravenous self-administration (IVSA), the gold standard
behavioral paradigm for modeling SUD in laboratory animals. I will determine if there are Rgs12 genotype-
associated effects on the acquisition and maintenance of cocaine or METH self-administration, as well as on
reinstatement of extinguished cocaine or METH self-administration. My second aim (my postdoctoral research
direction) is to characterize the GPCR transcriptome in SUD-relevant circuitry, as GPCRs are excellent targets
for modulating the activities of cells/circuits. In the K00 training phase, I will use retrograde tracers to label single
cells that project to SUD-relevant brain regions. I will then identify, using single-cell RNA-seq, the GPCR
transcriptome of labeled cells. Ideally, those data will reveal GPCRs that, upon activation or inactivation, will
dampen dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. The proposed research phases will provide me ample
opportunities to learn new techniques. Additionally, the proposed training plan will help me improve my skills in
presenting, writing, mentoring, teaching, and leading a laboratory group."

 Organic synthesis plays a crucial role in the development of small molecule therapeutics. New
methodologies that allow for the introduction of defined stereocenters and difficult-to-access motifs,
such as quarternary stereocenters, are particularly desirable. Moreover, there is growing interest in the
use of unconventional synthetic building blocks to generate such complexity, as the use of uncommon
starting materials provides new strategies and retrosynthetic disconnections that may prove broadly
useful.
 The proposed research involves the use of amides in transition metal-catalyzed reactions to
generate enantioenriched products bearing quaternary stereocenters. Although amides have
historically been avoided as synthetic building blocks, they have recently been employed in transition
metal-catalyzed reactions that proceed via C–N bond activation. However, amide cross-coupling
methods that make quaternary stereocenters are rare and no catalytic enantioselective examples have
been reported. The success of the proposed studies would push the limits of known amide cross-
coupling methodology, provide methods to access defined quaternary stereocenters, and offer new
strategies for synthetic chemists to utilize in the construction of drugs and complex molecules."

Antibiotic resistance is a significant threat to human health. Human therapeutic antibiotic use, the majority of
which occurs in outpatient settings for non-severe infections, is a major, modifiable driver of resistance. Acute
respiratory infections (ARIs) account for large proportions of outpatient antibiotic use and vaccines have been
recognized as important mechanisms to combat antibiotic use and resistance, especially for ARIs. However,
uncertainties remain in understanding the contributions of common respiratory pathogens to outpatient antibiotic
use and quantifying the full potential of vaccines to reduce antibiotic use, impeding informed policymaking and
priority-setting for vaccine research and development. The proposed research addresses these gaps in the
context of both existing and pipeline vaccines for three common respiratory pathogens in children: Streptococcus
pneumonaie, influenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The objective of this proposed work is to
estimate impacts of both existing and potential vaccine strategies on outpatient antibiotic prescriptions for ARIs
in children. More specifically, the research focuses on the following aims: 1) estimate the attributable fractions
of ARI-associated pediatric outpatient antibiotic use due to vaccine-preventable respiratory pathogens; 2)
evaluate the impact of pneumococcal vaccination strategies on outpatient antibiotic use for ARIs in children; and
3) evaluate the impact of viral (influenza, RSV) vaccination strategies on outpatient antibiotic use for ARIs in
children. This project focuses specifically on ARIs in children as they are both major drivers of outpatient antibiotic
use and targets of existing and pipeline vaccines. The work will leverage multiple, complementary, large-scale
data sources including both claims data (Optum Clinformatics, IBM MarketScan) and nationally-representative
outpatient medical surveys (National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical
Care Survey), each with millions of pediatric ARI visits and outpatient antibiotic prescriptions per year, to address
these aims. The breadth of data and statistical and epidemiologic methods used in this proposed research will
enable a novel and comprehensive understanding of the potential for vaccines to reduce outpatient antibiotic
use for ARIs in children. This work will inform urgently-needed antibiotic resistance mitigation strategies and
priority setting and decision-making for vaccine research/development and policy. The proposed methods will
further provide a novel framework for evaluating current and future vaccines as outpatient infections and
antibiotic use are not commonly considered endpoints, despite their substantial burden. This research will be
enhanced by and complementary to my proposed training plan, which emphasizes development and experience
in epidemiologic and statistical methods, big data methods and applications, subject matter expertise, and
additional skills necessary for me to become an independent investigator. UC Berkeley, particularly the School
of Public Health, provides extensive resources and support to enable me to successfully complete the proposed
fellowship and fulfill my long-term goal of becoming a research-oriented infectious disease epidemiologist."

Aging is a key risk factor for chronic disease development which can affect lifespan and quality of life. Cellular
senescence has emerged as a potential target to slow down the aging process. Senescent cells are in a state of
proliferative arrest and are highly associated with aging and pathological conditions. They accumulate in multiple
tissues and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and other kinds of molecules that damage surrounding tissues.
The markers p16 and p21 (cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors) are commonly used to identify senescent cells,
but emerging evidence has shown that these markers are not entirely sensitive or specific markers for
senescence. There is currently a lack of understanding of the exact genetic markers that define senescent cells
especially on the single cell level. With studies showing that senescent cell clearance can alleviate various
diseases associated with aging it is vital to achieve a greater understanding of senescent cell markers so that
precision medicine treatments can be designed to more effectively eliminate senescent cells. In this proposal
we aim to examine the transcriptome of senescent cells on the single cell level both with aging and
senolytic treatment in human adipose tissues. Senescent cells have been demonstrated to accumulate in
adipose tissue with aging and chronic disease and with the vast array of cell types present in adipose tissue it
makes an excellent model to study specific cell types and markers associated with senescence. Aim 1 will
explore the transcriptome of naturally occurring senescent cell populations in adipose tissue with aging.
We will use single nucleus RNA sequencing to capture cell types sensitive to typical single cell dissociation
methods and compare the transcriptome differences between cells in aged vs. young tissues. We hypothesize
that adipose tissue from older donors will contain more senescent cells and that several novel genetic markers
will be identified in these cells. Aim 2 will look at the effects of senolytic treatment on human adipose tissue
on the single cell level. Senolytics are drugs that are designed to specifically eliminate senescent cells but we
do not know the precise cell types targeted by senolytics. We will use single nucleus RNA sequencing to uncover
the transcriptome changes that occur with senescent cell elimination and learn what cell types are removed with
senolytic treatment. This project will help advance the field achieving a greater understanding of senescent cell
populations in adipose tissue and the markers that define them, which is essential to understanding and
potentially treating numerous diseases. Through this fellowship my training will include developing my skills in
genetics, aging, computational analysis, communication, presentation, networking, scientific writing, clinical
knowledge and mentorship. This training will occur in the environment of UCONN Health as well as the Jackson
Laboratory and other research institutions. This work will allow me to take advantage of training opportunities
and mentorship to advance my career as a future physician-scientist."

Research: To discover novel factors and mechanisms that enhance the quality of memory T cells has the potential to
impact the development of cancer immunotherapies. My recent publication demonstrated that caloric restriction (CR)
enhanced the function of memory T cells to control melanoma and significantly extend host survival. As such, CR could
represent an accessible nutritional intervention to modulate the function of the immune system for the treatment of
cancer. However, the molecular determinants and signalling pathways involved remain unclear, which are critical to
uncover in order to rationally design and implement diet-based therapeutic approaches. Based on preliminary data
and the published work of others, this proposal will investigate the role of microbiota-derived acetate in enhancing
memory T cell function during CR to promote melanoma control. Such information has the potential to benefit human
health by improving strategies aimed at treating cancer.
Career Goals: My overarching career goal is to become an independent investigator at an academic institution where
I study the mechanisms by which CR can be utilized as a nutritional intervention to modulate the immune system for
the treatment cancer. Furthermore, I believe that teaching and mentoring are essential aspects of being an
independent investigator and therefore aspire to become an inspirational teacher and an outstanding mentor.
Career Development Plan: To become a successful independent investigator I will need to develop various research,
professional and personal skills. These will include acquiring expertise in molecular biology and microbiology
techniques, as well as fostering collaborations and developing skills in writing, mentoring, teaching, communicating
and laboratory management. The NIH provides an outstanding academic environment in which trainees can fulfil these
criteria by regularly presenting data, receiving feedback from prominent scientists, fostering collaborations and
enrolling in courses to develop skills in specialist scientific areas, personal development and laboratory management.
Furthermore, in addition to my mentor and co-mentor, I have support from several independent investigators with
extensive expertise in areas that will greatly facilitate the completion of experiments proposed here. As such, the NIH
is an ideal environment to develop during the K99 phase as I progress to become a successful independent
investigator.
Career Development Environment: I will perform the K99 phase in the laboratory of Dr. Yasmine Belkaid at the NIH,
which provides an unprecedented environment in terms of the resources and facilities available. The laboratory has
access to all of the instruments and facilities necessary to complete the experiments proposed in this application.
These include a gnotobiotic animal facility and a sequencing facility that also provides bioinformatics analysis. The
mentorship I will receive will be of the highest standard and there will be numerous opportunities to collaborate."
10784595,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The United States (U.S.) trails behind almost all high-income nations with respect to newborn health, with rates
of adverse outcomes, including perinatal mortality, preterm birth, and low birthweight, having demonstrated
minimal progress in recent years. Significant disparities underlie such outcomes, with higher rates among
racial and ethnic minorities and individuals of low socioeconomic status. While such populations frequently
face barriers in accessing adequate care, other studies suggest that certain low-risk populations experience
over-provision of maternal care. Rising trends in prenatal care and imaging, for example, are tempered by
limited rigorous evidence that increases in utilization have meaningfully improved outcomes. This reality
necessitates a renewed approach to maternity care, including: 1) generation of evidence-based policies and
guidelines, particularly ones that benefit vulnerable populations; and 2) better assessment of interventions with
ambiguous benefit to improve targeting of care. Two specific areas of policy and clinical relevance include
access to immediate postpartum contraception and antepartum fetal surveillance, strategies with potential to
improve newborn outcomes but for which existing evidence is limited. Accordingly, the overall goal of this
proposal is to produce rigorous evidence on: 1) a Medicaid policy incentivizing provision of immediate
postpartum long-acting reversible contraception (IPP-LARC); and 2) the scope and effect of
antepartum fetal surveillance. Aim 1 utilizes state inpatient discharge data from three states and a synthetic
control design to estimate the impact of Medicaid provider payments for provision of IPP-LARC on short birth
intervals, preterm birth, and low birthweight. Aim 2 leverages electronic health record data from a large,
integrated health system and a machine-learning-based propensity score design to assess the scope and
effect of antepartum fetal surveillance on perinatal mortality and other related newborn outcomes. The
proposed research aligns closely with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development’s
(NICHD) research priorities to promote reproductive health, better understand the health impacts of
contraception, empower healthy pregnancies, and address health disparities. The overall fellowship training
plan will be supported by a multidisciplinary mentorship team and a collaborative training environment
dedicated to research, professional, and clinical skills development. Through bridging methods in machine
learning and quasi-experimental evaluation that have rarely been used in the evaluation of maternal care
policies and guidelines, this proposal will be instrumental in informing data-driven clinical practice around
immediate postpartum contraception and antepartum fetal surveillance. Together, such evidence will help
advance equitable newborn outcomes in the U.S."

Current experiences, memories, and imagined futures all affect behavior. Evidence demonstrates that the
hippocampus (HPC) can represent past locations, present position, and possible future trajectories. The HPC,
however, is often referred to as a single structure capable of only one type of representation at a time, but the
HPC can be divided into subregions along its dorsoventral axis. There is evidence for different functional roles
of the dorsal and ventral HPC in spatial navigation, but recent gene expression studies suggest the
dorsoventral axis can be divided into at least three subregions: dorsal, intermediate, and ventral. In contrast to
these partitions, electrophysiology signatures evolve gradually along the HPC longitudinal axis, suggesting a
gradual evolution of function. Whether the dorsal HPC (dHPC) and intermediate HPC (iHPC) behave as
distinct networks as suggested by molecular subdivisions or as parts of a larger functional gradient is unknown.
Both subregions are known to represent space, and studies in the dHPC have shown that representations of
local and nonlocal space are temporally patterned around a regular oscillation in the field potential. This
oscillation is present but phase-shifted in the iHPC, so the temporal patterning of local and nonlocal
representations may differ from the patterning in the dHPC. This means that the HPC may simultaneously
represent past, present, and future locations, and if so, the two subregions should be viewed as distinct
networks that both contribute to encoding space. Through a combination of experimental and analytic
methods, this project tests the hypothesis that dHPC and iHPC are best understood as distinct subregions that
represent space noncoherently.
 We will test these hypotheses by recording simultaneously in the rat dHPC and iHPC during a spatial
navigation task and studying the structure and temporal organization of spatial representations (Aim 1) as well
as the characteristics of correlated activity across the two subregions using a model of network activity (Aim
2). This computational model serves as a complementary approach to understanding the nature of correlated
activity in the HPC; it is completely agnostic to what neurons may encode and has no free parameters to
adjust. By combining both experimental methods with cutting edge analytic techniques, the proposed aims
have the potential to uncover previously unknown richness of representations in the HPC that will give further
insight into how memories and simulations of the future are coordinated with present experiences. The
simultaneous existence of these representations may serve as a neural substrate for relating past, present,
and future experiences to one another across time."

This proposal details a 5-year career development training program focused on developing a patient-specific
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model system to study the role of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cell
dysfunction at the inception of pulmonary fibrosis (PF). A growing literature now implicates alveolar epithelial
dysfunction as playing a role in the events that lead to downstream fibroblast activation culminating in relentless
fibrosis in a variety of interstitial lung disease (ILD) syndromes, including adult idiopathic PF (IPF) and childhood
ILD (chILD). However, without access to patient-specific human epithelial-mesenchymal model systems, there
are limited options for testing hypotheses of how AT2 cell dysfunction leads to disease in humans. The outlined
proposal builds on an in vitro human model system recently developed and published by the candidate to better
understand the mechanisms by which AT2 cell dysfunction in the context of the most common disease-
associated SFTPC variant (SFTPCI73T) leads to PF. The mechanisms identified by studying AT2 cell dysfunction
using the in vitro iPSC-derived model will be further validated in vivo in SftpcI73T mutant mice. More specifically,
the aims of this proposal are to: 1) study the role of AT2 cell dysfunction and the downstream consequences of
epithelial dysfunction in eliciting a fibrotic cascade by utilizing a novel human patient-specific iPSC in vitro
epithelial-mesenchymal recombinant model system, 2) test the hypothesis that AT2 cell-intrinsic perturbations
characterized by proteostasis defects and metabolic reprograming result in impaired AT2-to-AT1 cell
differentiation, inflammatory activation, and fibrogenic mesenchymal activation, and 3) identify druggable
pathways for novel PF therapies by testing novel approaches to restore AT2 cell proteostasis and mitochondrial
function. Both the model system to be developed and the pathogenic mechanisms to be revealed likely will be
generalizable to a broad diversity of PF phenotypes, providing novel druggable targets for both familial and
sporadic PF therapies. Dr. Alysandratos has 80% protected time from the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, Sleep
& Critical Care Medicine and the Boston University Department of Medicine. His mentor, Dr. Darrell Kotton at
the Center for Regenerative Medicine (CReM), is an international expert in stem cell biology with a focus on
applying stem cells to model and understand lung development and disease, making him ideally suited for this
career development award focused on iPSC-model systems of PF. A team of extraordinary scientific advisory
members, each bringing their specific expertise, has been carefully assembled to provide complementary
guidance. A detailed training plan is presented that includes mentored research, didactic coursework,
presentations at meetings, and a timeline for completion of the research aims, preparation of manuscripts, and
future R01 application. At the completion of this proposal, the candidate will have developed the necessary
expertise to successfully transition into an independent physician-scientist."

Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind variable drug metabolism and disposition (DMD) is critical
to improve pharmacotherapy and drug development. The ultimate goal of my research is to decipher novel
posttranscriptional regulation mechanisms controlled by noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) and establish
their importance in DMD. My laboratory pioneered miRNA research in the fields of DMD that is expected to
fill the critical gaps in understanding new posttranscriptional regulation mechanisms. Nevertheless, current
studies on miRNA functions in DMD, as well as in the broad areas of general medical sciences, are limited to
the use of chemo-engineered RNA “mimics” made in vitro, which, comprised of extensive and various types
of chemical modifications, are fundamentally different from natural RNA molecules that are produced and
folded in cells and do not carry or just have minimal degree of posttranscriptional modifications. This is also
in sharp contrast to protein research that has found the ultimate success by using recombinant or
bioengineered proteins produced and folded in living cells, instead of synthetic polypeptides or proteins
made in vitro. Very recently, we have developed a novel recombinant RNA technology, based upon hybrid
tRNA/pre-miRNA carriers, which offers high-yield and large-scale production of recombinant miRNA agents
(& small interfering RNAs or siRNAs) through cost-effective bacterial fermentation. Our studies have also
demonstrated that bioengineered miRNA agent (BERA) acts as a “prodrug”, which is specifically processed
to target miRNA molecule in human cells to selectively regulate target gene expression. Further, the access
to large quantity (tens milligrams from 1 L bacterial culture) of high-purity (>98%) recombinant miRNA
molecules allows us to readily investigate the impact of miRNAs on pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) in animal models in vivo. These highly innovative approaches and
one-of-its-kind recombinant miRNA tools shall open up new avenues for miRNA research and development,
as well as broadly general medical sciences. In this MIRA application, we propose to produce and utilize
one-of-a-kind recombinant miRNAs to dissect new regulatory mechanisms in DMD by addressing the
following key questions: 1) Can the tRNA/pre-miRNA-based technology be re-innovated for the production
of fully-humanized recombinant miRNAs (hBERA/miRNAs)? 2) Will hBERA/miRNAs be processed to target
miRNAs in human hepatocytes and liver cells to selectively modulate drug-metabolizing enzyme or
transporter expression, and alter cellular DMD capacity? 3) To what degrees will miRNA alter PK and PD in
the whole-body system?"

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the management of patients with metastatic non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). Unfortunately, over 50% of patients do not respond to these therapies. Combination
strategies with chemotherapy-ICIs show progress, but long-term responses remain rare, pointing to the role for
other tumor-associated mechanisms affecting functionality of immune cells. Adenosinergic signaling has recently
emerged as a powerful immuno-metabolic regulator within the tumor microenvironment (TME) exploited by
tumors to promote their growth and suppress immunity. Preclinical studies on interference with adenosine
generation or signaling through A2A and A2B adenosine receptors (A2BAR) have demonstrated efficacy in relieving
this immunosuppression by reducing stress in the TME and decreasing expression of key adenosine-generating
enzymes, thereby enhancing efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition. A2BAR blockade in particular enhanced
anti-tumor immunity through both a reduction in myeloid-derived suppressor cell differentiation and an
enhancement of the capacity of dendritic cells to evoke anti-tumor T cell responses. These findings provide
strong rationale for clinical applications of A2BAR antagonists in combination with current ICIs. To determine
whether disruption of A2BAR signaling has the potential to improve upon single agent PD-1 immunotherapy, we
propose a phase Ib clinical trial testing the A2BAR antagonist PBF-1129 in combination with nivolumab in
patients with metastatic NSCLC. The primary objective of the clinical study is to evaluate the safety and
tolerability of combination PBF-1129 with nivolumab; preliminary evidence of efficacy will be evaluated in an
expansion cohort. Analysis of pre- and on- treatment blood and tumor samples will be conducted to evaluate the
correlation between and immunological parameters and adenosine generation and signaling, and to evaluate
the efficacy of PBF-1129 in targeting adenosine-mediated immunosuppression. Finally, we intend to further
elucidate mechanisms of metabolic TME and immune regulation by adenosine in pre-clinical cancer models and
test the combined PBF-1129/anti-PD-1 approach to ameliorate metabolic TME using a novel imaging modality.
Together, we expect that A2BAR antagonist treatment combined with nivolumab will be a safe, effective
approach targeting different mechanisms of immunosuppression and tumor growth in metastatic
NSCLC patients, that we will uncover immunological profiles reflective of adenosinergic signaling
disruption in these patients, and that we will demonstrate the utility of a novel combined imaging
approach for evaluation of adenosine targeting in the TME."

We are rapidly running out of options to combat infectious diseases in an era that is marked by a rise in antibiotic
resistant bacterial pathogens. The discovery rate of novel antibiotics is not keeping up with this pressing need
and thus we have to identify alternative drug targets and develop complementary elimination strategies. This is
a particularly challenging task for infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria because their outer membrane
is impermeable to many compounds. We discovered an aryl polyene (APE) virulence factor, widespread among
Gram-negative pathogens, and here propose to characterize its biosynthesis and use it as a target for the
development of elimination strategies. APEs are the product of the most abundant family of biosynthetic gene
clusters (BGCs) in our global in silico analysis of bacterial genomes. They are present in several multidrug-
resistant pathogens, and our preliminary data shows that APEs are esterified to a yet unidentified anchor
molecule in the Gram-negative outer membrane. Furthermore, we discovered that APEs serve as virulence
factors that protect their producers from host innate immune clearance mechanisms. Our long-term goal is to
understand APE biology on a molecular, functional and evolutionary level.
The current proposal is centered on the hypothesis that APE biosynthesis and cell envelope localization provide
targets for specific antivirulence strategies against Gram-negative pathogens. We will test this by first
characterizing the function of individual genes within the APE outer membrane localization pathway and
identifying the APE-containing anchor molecule. Next, we will determine the environmental conditions that
control regulation of APE expression using a forward genetics approach. Finally, we will develop interference
strategies to inhibit APE production, using a targeted inhibitor of the initiation enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway.
Our proposed project will yield mechanistic insights into the biology of APEs, as well as identify small molecule
tool compounds that can be used to study APE biology and enable alternative pathogen eradication strategies."
10800662,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity is a global epidemic that is associated with excessive central sympathetic outflow to cardiovascular
end organs to elevate blood pressure and predispose to hypertension. Accumulating evidence from our
laboratory suggests that deficiency of angiotensin-(1-7), a protective hormone of the renin-angiotensin system,
provides an important link connecting obesity with sympathetic overactivation and hypertension. Our published
observations, combined with preliminary data, support this concept by showing that high fat diet-induced obese
mice exhibit circulating angiotensin-(1-7) deficiency, and restoration of this hormone attenuates cardiovascular
sympathetic overactivity and hypertension in this model. Our preliminary data expand on these phenotypic
findings by providing evidence that angiotensin-(1-7) depressor effects require activation of neural circuits
originating in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC). We show that both systemic and intra-ARC
angiotensin-(1-7) lowers blood pressure in mice, with effects prevented by deletion of angiotensin-(1-7) mas
receptors in the ARC. We further show that blood pressure lowering effects of angiotensin-(1-7) require
activation of specific subpopulations of ARC neurons that are likely proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing,
as well as cyclic AMP second messenger systems. We propose that angiotensin-(1-7) selectively activates
POMC neurons that release the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In support of
this, we show that: mas receptors are highly localized to GABAergic POMC neurons; and angiotensin-(1-7)
increases GABA synthesis enzymes in the ARC without altering POMC gene expression. Based on these data,
this proposal will test the central hypothesis that angiotensin-(1-7) activates mas receptors on GABAergic
POMC neurons in the ARC to reduce cardiovascular sympathetic outflow and lower blood pressure. Aim 1 will
determine if angiotensin-(1-7) selectively increases the excitability of GABAergic ARC POMC neurons using
transgenic mouse reporter lines combined with whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology methods. Aim 2 will
determine if angiotensin-(1-7) requires mas receptors in ARC POMC neurons to lower blood pressure via
GABA release mechanisms using a novel mas receptor conditional knockout mouse model we developed and
chemogenetic and pharmacological approaches. Aim 3 will determine if angiotensin-(1-7) decreases
sympathetic nerve traffic to cardiovascular organs using sophisticated in vivo isolated nerve recording
approaches. These studies will be conducted in male and female mice under control and high fat diet
conditions, to determine the impact of sex and obesity on angiotensin-(1-7) activation of this neural circuit.
Overall, this proposal will span the cellular to whole animal levels to provide new insight into angiotensin-(1-7)
effects on neural circuits controlling sympathetic outflow and blood pressure, and related cellular and
neurotransmitter mechanisms. Importantly, these studies have more long-term potential to determine if
targeting angiotensin-(1-7) represents a novel approach for the treatment of obesity-related hypertension."
10881697,"Research: The ability to monitor malignant tumor burden below the limit of radiographic detection remains a
major unmet need. Liquid biopsy for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) offers promise, however, deep targeted
sequencing methods – the conventional approach in the field – face a sensitivity plateau in low volume cancer
due to the sparsity of ctDNA signal. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of plasma overcomes this sensitivity
barrier by expanding the number of informative sites to the thousands of somatic single nucleotide variants
observed across the genome in solid tumors. We showed with our tumor-informed MRDetect framework that
WGS of plasma can increase liquid biopsy sensitivity by 1-2 orders of magnitude beyond deep targeted
sequencing methods. To expand applicability and overcome MRDetect’s need for matched tumor tissue, I built
MRD-EDGE, a plasma-only (de novo) classifier that uses advanced machine learning to increase error
suppression and amplify ctDNA signal. My preliminary data shows that MRD-EDGE can quantify ctDNA tumor
burden during the nadir of response to immunotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma, and can
demonstrate a response to treatment as early as 3 weeks after first infusion. MRD-EDGE therefore enables
precise monitoring of malignant disease burden in response to therapy using standard WGS alone.
In this proposal, I aim to first radically improve MRD-EDGE sensitivity by including epigenetic features that
inform likelihood of cancer mutagenesis, which I hypothesize will allow for unprecedented plasma-only liquid
biopsy sensitivity. I will then use the optimized MRD-EDGE platform to define early response or resistance to
immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma, which will establish ctDNA as a biomarker that can complement or
replace imaging. Finally, I will optimize MRD-EDGE for use in lung cancer and use the platform to monitor
response to neoadjuvant immunotherapy and detect postoperative minimal residual disease. I expect that
ultra-sensitive monitoring of ctDNA dynamics in the neoadjuvant period can guide precision adjuvant therapy in
the postoperative period and thereby provide a transformative impact on patient care.
Candidate: I am an Instructor of Medicine at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and a Visiting
Fellow at the New York Genome Center (NYGC). I have outlined a 5-year career development plan to
transition to an independent, tenure-track physician-scientist investigating the detection and monitoring of solid
tumors through ultrasensitive liquid biopsy. I will conduct the proposed research under the mentorship of Dr.
Dan Landau, an internationally recognized expert in liquid biopsy and cancer genomics. I will use the K08
award to further develop skills in next-generation sequencing methods and analysis and advanced machine
learning. MSK and the NYGC are ideal environments in which to pursue my scientific and career goals. Both
institutions have world class research communities and an outstanding track record of training independent

10795919,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Individuals living with Alzheimer's Disease and Related dementias (ADRD) may experience unwanted,
intensive or burdensome end-of-life care because their preferences for care are unknown to their medical
decision makers. For example, nearly 41% of individuals with ADRD undergo at least one intensive
intervention (e.g., mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition) in the last 3 months of life, which may prolong life
but does not address quality of life. Thus, timely discussions about advance care planning (ACP) are
imperative before individuals with dementia lose decision making capacity. Persons with cognitive impairment,
spanning from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, are often cared for in primary care. However, primary
care settings do not have effective models that can systematically integrate clinician-patient discussions and
decision-making about ACP for older adults with and without cognitive impairment who still have decision
making capacity. To address these gaps, we designed, refined with stakeholder input, and demonstrated the
feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a theory-based and practical ACP group visit intervention, ENACT
Group Visits (Engaging in Advance Care Planning Talks) among older primary care patients. ENACT Group
Visits are two facilitated discussions, one month apart, led by a physician or advanced practice provider and a
social worker. The intervention uses evidence-based ACP materials and leverages the group dynamic to
promote patient goal-setting and self-efficacy. In a single-clinic pilot study, patients randomized to the ENACT
Group Visits intervention had a 26% higher rate of ACP documents at 6 months, compared to a control arm of
mailed ACP materials (p=0.007). This study aims to test the effectiveness of ENACT Group Visits to increase
ACP documentation (one aspect of ACP) and to evaluate its effectiveness among patients across a spectrum
of cognitive impairment, including early dementia. The proposed 2-arm, patient-level randomized trial will be
conducted in five primary care clinics and is powered to compare ENACT Group Visits intervention vs control
mailed ACP materials. We will use 1:1 allotment and patient-level block randomization by presence or absence
of CI. The study will use components of PREPARE™, an evidence-based ACP program designed to decrease
cognitive burden, and an easy-to-read advance directive. Aim 1 will determine the effectiveness of ENACT
Group Visits vs control at 6 months to increase ACP documentation (primary outcome), ACP readiness,
decision self-efficacy, and quality of communication (secondary outcomes). Aim 2 will determine whether the
effectiveness of ENACT Group Visits intervention varies by cognitive impairment, including ADRD. Aim 3 will
describe acceptability and feasibility, as well as intervention fidelity and implementation outcomes, of ENACT
Group Visits intervention using qualitative and mixed methods. This primary care-based effectiveness trial of
ENACT Group Visits intervention among older adults, including those with dementia, will generate needed
evidence for implementing effective ACP interventions into real-world primary care settings."
10810689,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retroelements and spliceosomal introns comprise ~70% of the
human genome. Both of these genetic elements are thought to have evolved from a group II intron ancestor.
Group II introns are catalytic RNAs that are able to engage in both retrotransposition and pre-mRNA splicing.
Group II introns engage in retrotransposition and function as retroelements using a copy-and-paste mechanism
that allows insertion into new locations in DNA genomes using a reverse transcriptase (RT) and an intron RNA
template. Despite the prevalence of retroelements in eukaryotic genomes, relatively little is known about the
precise molecular mechanism of retrotransposition. Group II introns are also ancestral to the splicesome,
which is responsible for catalyzing pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotes. This evolutionary linkage is supported by
the fact that the active site of the group II intron is conserved with that of the spliceosome. Group II introns can
catalyze self-splicing reactions that results in the excision of intron lariat and ligation of the adjacent exons.
There are still many unanswered questions regarding the precise mechanism of pre-mRNA splicing and the
function of highly conserved nucleotides within the active site. Group II introns consist of two major
components that form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex: 1) a self-splicing catalytic RNA and 2) a multi-
functional maturase protein that has RT activity. We have isolated a thermostable group II intron RNP that
exhibits high levels of retrotransposition and splicing activity. Our group II intron complex is very amenable to
high-resolution structure determination and in vitro biochemical studies. To gain mechanistic insight into both
retrotransposition and pre-mRNA splicing, we aim to use single-particle cryo-EM, x-ray crystallography,
genetics and single-molecule approaches to characterize and capture the different stages of catalysis in this
group II intron system. The knowledge gained from these studies will provide direct insight into the
mechanisms of both retroelements and the splicing machinery found in higher eukaryotes. This work also lays
the foundation for the future biochemical and structural investigation of mammalian retroelements. In
summary, the goals of this proposal will further knowledge of the structure and function of genetic elements
that comprise a majority of the human genome."

Native elders are essential to preserving the culture and history of tribal communities, but fall-related injuries can
jeopardize their ability to age in place. The Zuni Pueblo is geographically isolated with limited access to
rehabilitative and supportive services. Home health physical therapy services are unavailable at the Pueblo.
Therefore, Zuni elders must choose between leaving their community and social network for rehabilitative care
or remain in the community with unmet needs, and increased risk of not regaining their prior level of function.
We propose to culturally tailor the traditional Physical Therapy delivered Otago Exercise Program (OEP), to
evaluate its effectiveness in reducing falls risk and to empower elders and their families to engage in preventing
falls in their community. Native Zuni CHRs will deliver OEP using novel consultation and telehealth with a
Physical Therapist. The CHRs offer important advantage of speaking “Shiwi” (Zuni tribal language) and
understanding Zuni traditions, family structures, and elders’ preferences for receiving health information. Our
overall objective is to compare the effectiveness of a CHR-delivered, culturally-adapted OEP fall prevention
program to the standard of care education-based fall risk management.
Our disparity driven aims are: Aim 1: Foster a sustainable multi-directional, participatory collaboration between
the Zuni’s tribal leadership, stakeholders, Zuni Indian Health Services, and University of New Mexico Health
Sciences Center to enhance fall prevention training, education, and research; Aim 2: To culturally adapt the
evidence-based OEP for use with the Zuni elder population. Approach: We will train CHRs to utilize the CDC
STEADI toolkit for fall risk screening and education and CHRs will culturally adapt the education and OEP with
input from Zuni elders; Aim 3: To compare the effectiveness of the adapted OEP to an education-based fall risk
management usual care program in improving strength and balance and reducing falls risk. Approach: Screen
400 Zuni elders, aged 65yrs and older, to identify 200 elders with elevated fall risk. Randomize 200 Zuni elders
at risk for falls into a 6-month OEP intervention versus education-based control; and Aim 4: To compare the
effectiveness of the adapted OEP to an education-based fall risk management program in improving overall
health status, self-management of daily activities, and social engagement. Approach: We will administer SF-12
Health Survey and Short Form PROMIS measures Self-Efficacy for Managing Daily Activities and Ability to
Participate in Social Roles and Activities to all randomized participants, at baseline and 6 months, and during
the final follow up visit at 12 months."

cancer biologists and clinicians fostered by the Yale Cancer Center to provide a cancer-focused training
experience that is intended to spawn the next generation of cancer scientific leaders. This program is the only
cancer-focused PhD training program at Yale and is also unusual in the extent of exposure to clinical concepts
and practice. Training will cover the genetic and biological underpinnings of cancer, the pathway to
development of new therapies based upon this knowledge, and the practical challenges in applying these new
therapies in cancer clinics. Predoctoral trainees will be trained in foundational biological areas through course
work in fundamental areas including biology, genetics, computational biology, and pathophysiology and join the
program in the second year of graduate school. Postdoctoral fellows will join the program early in postdoctoral
training. All trainees will spend 90% of their time in laboratory research projects mentored by highly qualified
faculty who are leaders in disciplines of cancer research including tumor virology, cancer immunobiology,
cancer genetics and epigenetics, stem cell research, metabolism, pharmacology, and signal transduction.
 This two-year program will train up to 30 predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees each year (including first
and second year trainees). Funding for two predoctoral and six postdoctoral trainees will be supported by this
training grant. For predoctoral trainees, the training experience will include three research rotations and
didactic and seminar courses and continue with qualifying examinations and written dissertation in a projected
period of five years overall. Postdoctoral training includes participation in program coursework and other
program activities. All trainees are supervised by faculty committees that meet annually to evaluate research
progress and promote training goals and career development. Cancer-specific training provided for all trainees
will include three formal courses: 1. a general survey class covering basic principles of cancer biology and
genetics; 2. Advanced Topics in Cancer workshop in which selected topics are analyzed and discussed in

10791888,"Project Summary/Abstract
Aphasia is a common and devastating effect of left hemisphere stroke and is one of the most debilitating
communication disorders characterized by speech/language production and comprehension deficits. According
to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), approximately one million individuals in
the U.S. suffer from aphasia. This number is anticipated to rise as life expectancy increases and life-saving
procedures in acute stroke decrease mortality rates. Although speech therapy can improve communication in
aphasia, most patients with chronic stroke never fully recover and are left with life-long disability and some only
experience very minimal return of communicative function. Therefore, a major public health need is to identify
biomarkers to inform targeted treatment and improve its long-term outcomes in aphasia. A major shortcoming
of currently existing treatment approaches is that they primarily focus on enhancing the outcome measures
associated vocal motor production, without taking into account that targeting deficits in sensory feedback
and/or sensorimotor integration mechanisms may significantly increase treatment efficiency and effectiveness.
Therefore, a key step toward refining treatment strategies is to develop objective biomarkers that can probe the
integrity of vocal sensorimotor mechanisms and identify their impaired function in stroke patients with aphasia.
This proposed project is significant in that it takes a key step toward examining the biomarkers of impaired
vocal sensorimotor function in patients with post-stroke aphasia, with particular focus on understanding the role
of auditory feedback mechanisms in vocal communication. The central hypothesis is that distinct patterns of
brain damage and diminished connectivity within the audio-vocal networks leads to patient-specific impairment
of feedforward motor, sensory feedback, and/or sensorimotor integration mechanisms. The main objective is to
incorporate multi-modality measures including the behavioral biomarkers of altered auditory feedback (AAF),
lesion anatomy, white matter tractography, functional neuroimaging (MRI), and neurophysiological (EEG/ERP)
data to build integrative computational models for examining impaired vocal sensorimotor function in stroke
patients with aphasia. We also aim to use an innovative visual feedback training paradigm to provide a
secondary source of sensory information via the visual modality to improve audio-vocal integration function in
patients with aphasia. The validation of the visual feedback training paradigm will pave the way toward
developing individually tailored targeted therapies that focus on patient-specific functional deficits for vocal
communication. The long-term goal of this research is to identify the source and modality (motor, sensory,
and/or sensorimotor) of vocal communication deficits to provide information for clinicians on how to fine-tune
their strategies to maximize the long-term treatment outcomes and improve the communicative function and
quality of life in patients suffering from aphasia. This proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s mission
pertaining to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to reduce the burdens of human disability."
10814407,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Social isolation is a major contributor to poorer health outcomes, quality of life, and even survival. Adults with
communication disabilities are at a high risk for social isolation because communication impairments make it
difficult for them to interact with others. Many communication disorders in adults are chronic, thus restoring
typical communication abilities to enable people to resume usual participation in daily activities is not feasible.
For that reason, people with communication disabilities depend on accommodations in the environment to help
them remain active and engaged. Communication inherently involves interactions among people. Thus, the
most critical environmental accommodation (or barrier) is the behavior of people – the communication partners
- with whom the person interacts. The term ‘perceived social support’ is often used to refer to the help that
people feel they have available to them in times of illness or disability. Our prior research has identified that
perceived social support, as defined and measured in general healthcare domains, is not adequate for
capturing social support for communication as shaped by physical, attitudinal, and behavioral barriers in the
environment. Furthermore, family members who might usually provide such support may be hindered because
of how they are impacted by the communication disability themselves (third-party disability) through increased
care burden and loss of emotional connections. Qualitative research suggests that communication partners are
highly influential in keeping people with communication disabilities active in work, home, and social activities.
However, little is known about: 1) the extent and nature of perceived social support for communication and how
this influences life participation for people with communication disabilities, 2) the extent to which families
experience third-party disability and how this impacts social participation for people with communication
disabilities, and 3) the extent to which these phenomena are similar across different communication disorders.
Speech-language pathologists are called to provide patient-centered, biopsychosocial care addressing all
contributors to communication disability. However, the significant gap in our understanding of the role of socio-
environmental factors in life participation has left clinicians with sparse empirical foundations or clinical tools for
addressing the socio-environmental needs of clients. The long-term goal of this research is to help people with
communication disabilities and their families reduce social isolation and engage in fulfilling life participation by
improving environmental accommodations / social support for patients and reciprocal support for families. The
aims of this survey-methods study are to explore the hypothesis that perceived social support for
communication is a unique construct that contributes to life participation separately from the general concept of
perceived social support used in healthcare. This study will also explore how third-party disability contributes to
reduced communicative participation. The populations included are those with speech or voice impairments
due to Parkinson’s disease, laryngeal dystonia, laryngectomy, and oral-pharyngeal cancer."

Environmental biomechanical cues play a critical role in cell growth and functional homeostasis.
Many human diseases, such as organ fibrosis, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers, have been
associated with aberrant biomechanical cues that promote disease progression. However, how
cells sense and propagate biomechanical cues into biochemical signals, a process known as
mechanotransduction, is poorly understood. In particular, the precise signaling transduction
mechanisms and transcriptional outputs of mechanotransduction remain unknown. Unveiling the
roles and signaling cascades of mechanotransduction is important for understanding fundamental
development and disease mechanisms and for advancing therapeutic strategies.
 I have been developing a research program to elucidate the roles and mechanisms of
mechanotransduction in tissue growth control and disease development, with a current focus on
how mechanotransduction controls regeneration and fibrosis during organ injury and repair. The
main challenge in understanding mechanotransduction in this disease context is the lack of
knowledge of mechanotranscriptomes and signaling cascades that are triggered by a combination
of force-, cell-, and microenvironment-specific factors. In this proposal, I aim to answer 3 main
questions to advance our understanding in the field: (i) what role does mechanotransduction play
in regulating cellular functions and transcriptomes, particularly in the context of tissue repair? (ii)
what are the signaling cascades that connect plasma membrane mechanosensors to
mechanotranscriptomes? (iii) how do biomechanical cues and wound-healing signals integrate to
control cellular functions and transcriptomes?
 I will use endothelial cells and the liver as my main models to study these questions, as
they are classical models for studying mechanotransduction and tissue repair, respectively. We
will characterize endothelial mechanotransduction for its roles in liver regeneration and fibrosis
mainly using (i) in vitro or ex vivo bioengineered models with human primary endothelial cells,
and (ii) in vivo mouse models of liver injury. My research program will also include similar studies
of fibroblast mechanotransduction and lung regeneration and fibrosis.
 I anticipate that my research program will advance the fundamental understanding of
mechanotransduction in normal and diseased contexts, providing opportunities for identifying new
druggable targets from mechano-signaling cascades for organ fibrosis and other diseases with
aberrant tissue mechanics."
10828401,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The gastrointestinal tract is colonized by an enormous collection of commensal bacteria living in
harmony with the host. This poses a challenge for the immune system which must promote tolerance to
beneficial bacteria species while still providing protection against pathogenic species. Indeed, a breakdown in
such discrimination is thought to be a major underlying cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
 Unlike self-antigens, antigens derived from commensal microbiota are unlikely to be presented in the
thymus to impact central T cell tolerance. Rather, specific tolerance to these antigens must rely exclusively on
peripheral mechanisms acting within the immune environment of the gut. However, these mechanisms and
the quality of the tolerance they mediate are unclear. To better investigate these processes, our lab has
developed peptide:MHCII tetramer reagents that enable us to directly identify rare gut CD4+ T cells with
specificity to immunodominant epitopes from several different commensal bacteria species in mice. Our
preliminary studies support varied roles for deletion, Treg, and Tr1 cell development depending on the bacteria
species. To provide better resolution of commensal antigen-specific T cell phenotypes as well as the
heterogeneity of these phenotypes within the overall antigen-specific population, we are combining our use of
tetramers with single cell RNA-seq transcriptomics to comprehensively define phenotypic and clonal
heterogeneity within distinct commensal antigen-specific CD4+ T cell populations.
 The overarching goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms by which T cells maintain immune
tolerance to specific commensal bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract so that they may ultimately be
manipulated for therapeutic benefit. We hypothesize that tolerance to commensal bacterial antigens is
maintained by multiple CD4+ T cell fates, each making unique but overlapping functional contributions that
collectively establish durable tolerance in the face of the dynamic gut environment. We will test this hypothesis
by 1) defining developmental fates for commensal bacterial antigen-specific CD4+ T cells that contribute to
immune tolerance, and 2) characterizing the function of commensal antigen-specific regulatory T cell subsets."

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and heart failure (HF) remain the leading cause of mortality in
the U.S. Despite improved therapies, the incidence of first ASCVD and HF events is still unacceptably high.
Progress in preventing and managing these conditions will require a better understanding of their novel risk
factors and biological pathways. Protein levels can serve as potent, specific, and modifiable biomarkers for
ASCVD and HF risk, guide therapy and elucidate causal pathways. Large-scale proteomic technology has
become available to scan 4,993 distinct proteins simultaneously in just 0.15 ml of plasma, using modified
aptamers as binding reagents. The overarching goal of this proposal is to apply large-scale proteomics to
patients who are free of cardiovascular disease (CVD) to improve incident ASCVD and HF risk prediction and
increase understanding of the biological pathways and mechanisms underlying the development of these
diseases. We will conduct the proteomic investigation in MESA, a well-characterized, racially diverse cohort of
6814 persons without CVD at baseline, recruited between 2000 and 2002. Now >15 years out from the initial
study visit, >800 cardiovascular events have accumulated, providing an opportunity for ASCVD and HF risk
modeling. MESA was conceived with the primary goal to study “progression of subclinical to clinical CVD, with
coronary artery calcification (CAC) as a subclinical measure of ASCVD and cardiac MR (CMR) as a subclinical
measure of HF. Thus, in addition to modeling of ASCVD and HF clinical outcomes, we will devise proteomic
risk scores for the development of subclinical ASCVD and HF and for their conversion to clinical events. We
will conduct proteomic studies at three study visits that span 10 years, to delineate longitudinal proteomic risk
trajectories and create “live” mutable risk scores. Lastly, in an exploratory aim, we will leverage MESA’s near
equal representation of men and women and its racial diversity by testing for any heterogeneity of proteomic
risk scores and biological pathways associated with ASCVD and HF, according to sex and by race. Models for
ASCVD and HF risk will be developed within MESA and then externally validated in the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities (ARIC) cohort. In sum, our Aims are to assay the concentrations of 4,993 plasma proteins in
6,043 MESA participants at 3 study visits spanning 10 years to: 1) improve the risk prediction of incident
ASCVD and HF outcomes and earlier subclinical disease, 2) inform the biological pathways of incident ASCVD
and HF outcomes and subclinical disease, 3) inform sex and racial differences in the biology and propensity to
develop ASCVD and HF, and 4) validate key findings in the ARIC cohort."

Aim 3 explores whether associations between socially mediated vocal interactions and the development of language
competencies differs among children with HL on the basis of factors such as hearing age (time since augmented hearing).
Aim 3 also explores the role of other individual differences such as biological sex and SES indices on patterns of

Kidney transplant extends life, improves quality of life, and reduces healthcare costs. Unfortunately, the waiting
list exceeds 94,000 people while only approximately 14,000 deceased donor kidney transplants (DDKT) occur
annually and many patients wait >5 years for a DDKT. For the elderly and some other patient groups, it is
common to die waiting. Yet, nearly 600 kidneys from donors infected hepatitis C virus (HCV) were discarded in
2018 (50.1% of the total number of kidneys from HCV-viremic donors); hundreds more kidneys are never
procured because of the perception that no center will accept them. Early successes of pilot clinical trials and
single-center series of transplanting kidneys from HCV-viremic donors have demonstrated the potential for this
practice to increase the number of lifesaving kidney transplants by more than 1,000 kidney transplants each
year. However, the dominant system for assessing kidney quality also applies a lower quality score to any
kidney from an HCV-viremic donor, thereby promoting organ discard. Also, early experiences from
uncontrolled studies without well-matched comparator groups has led to reports of unexpected complications
and/or higher than anticipated rates of treatment failures that underscore the need for a formal multi-center
clinical trial. Recent reports have highlighted a series of post-transplant complications that necessitate
evaluation in a large multi-center trial, for example: a) fibrosing cholestatic HCV in several HCV-negative
recipients of an HCV-viremic donor; b) increased incidence of CMV viremia in recipients of HCV-viremic
kidneys; and c) membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. While these complications are rare, they underscore
the view from transplant leaders, including the American Society of Transplantation, the American Association
for the Study of Liver Diseases, and the Infectious Disease Society of America that this practice is considered
`experimental' and is best performed under IRB-approved protocols with rigorous informed consent and
assurances of access to HCV treatment. Furthermore, despite increased transplantation of kidneys from HCV-
viremic donors into HCV-negative patients, there remain persistent knowledge gaps that need to be addressed
for this practice to be accepted as routine clinical care from the perspective of patients, providers, and payers.
This multi-center trial seeks to provide significant knowledge gaps that remain by addressing these specific
aims: a) estimate HCV cure rates in HCV-negative recipients of HCV-viremic kidneys with a narrow confidence
interval; b) determine whether consenting to receiving an HCV-viremic kidney improves survival; c) evaluate 1-
year renal function of HCV-viremic kidneys compared to matched comparators; d) assess whether HCV-
negative recipients of HCV-viremic kidneys have increased risks of CMV infection; and e) determine if the
prevalence of chronic kidney disease pathology is similar in HCV-viremic vs HCV-negative kidney donors. The
overarching goal is to determine if kidneys from HCV-viremic donors can safely be transplanted into HCV-
negative patients with end-stage renal disease."

Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological disease. 70-80% of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed at
stage III or IV when peritoneal metastasis has already occurred. The unique metastasis pattern in ovarian cancer
involves the detachment of tumor cells, diffusion through the intraperitoneal space and attachment to the
mesothelial layer lining the omentum and abdominal organs. Both increased collagen deposition and
extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffening (due to altered collagen architecture) by stromal cells can create a pro-
metastatic environment. Paracrine action of tumor growth-inducing molecules like polyamines can also promote
metastasis. Identifying mechanisms that underlie collagen deposition and polyamine synthesis will allow better
understanding of metastasis and thus further development of therapeutic interventions.
One putative candidate for regulating metastasis is the fibrillar collagen-binding receptor tyrosine kinase
Discoidin Domain Receptor-2 (DDR2). DDR2 expression is increased in the stroma of high grade serous ovarian
cancer (HGSOC) patients and this increase is, alone, associated with shorter survival and worse response to
therapy. We found that there were fewer intraperitoneal tumors when DDR2-expressing tumor cells were injected
into the peritoneal cavity of syngeneic Ddr2-/- mice vs WT mice. To understand molecular reasons for this
difference I performed targeted mRNA sequencing of tumors from Ddr2 WT and Ddr2-/- mice and found that
expression of Arginase-1 was highly down-regulated in tumors from Ddr2-/- mice. Moreover, I found that shRNA
depletion of DDR2 in WT ovarian omental cancer-associated fibroblasts also significantly decreased Arginase-
1 expression and activity. A major metabolic function of Arginase-I in cells is to promote arginine degradation
into ornithine, which is a source of proline for collagen synthesis and polyamines that can impact cellular
proliferation.
Based upon these, and other, compelling preliminary data I propose to test the hypothesis: DDR2-regulated
Arginase-1 expression in ovarian cancer omental CAFs promotes metastasis by impacting collagen production
and ECM organization as well as polyamine synthesis. I will test this hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims:
Aim 1: Determine the role of intracellular Arginase-1 in omental cancer-associated fibroblasts on collagen
synthesis and architecture. Aim 2: Determine the role of intracellular Arginase-1 on polyamine-mediated tumor
cell metastasis. These studies will uncover novel mechanisms by which DDR2 regulates arginase-1 in omental
CAFs and how arginase-1 promotes metastasis through increased collagen deposition and polyamine synthesis.
As DDR2 has been implicated in lung, pancreatic, and breast cancer, my findings may have broad implications
in other cancers. This project will encourage my scientific growth as a physician scientist-in-training."
10789873,"Project Summary
 Age-related diseases are among the leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditure
both in the United States and the world at large. Age-associated declines in fertility are one of the earliest and
most common symptoms of aging in both men and women, and almost one-fourth of couples between the
ages of 18 and 45 suffer from impaired fertility or infertility. Although assisted reproductive technology can help
couples with impaired fertility produce viable offspring, it can be very expensive and does not treat the root of
the problem: germline aging. Existing literature on aging is relatively sparse, focusing on conventional model
organisms with relatively short lifespans and how various treatments can slow their decline rather than prevent
it entirely, or even reverse aging. The negligibly-senescent, highly-regenerative, hermaphroditic planarian S.
mediterranea presents a unique model system to study germline aging because it is one of the few species to
actively reverse an aging phenotype. I have observed that S. mediterranea experiences an age-related decline
in its fertility that can be reversed by bisecting the planarians and allowing them to regenerate. The overall goal
of my project is to determine how aging impairs fertility in S. mediterranea, and how regeneration overcomes
this impairment. Based on preliminary data, I hypothesize that age-associated molecular damage
accumulates in late gonadal precursor cells of the testes and (especially) ovaries, compromising the
production of mature germ cells, and that during regeneration these impaired cells are replaced by
functional equivalents to restore fertility. To evaluate this hypothesis, I will seek to address the following
specific aims. Aim 1: I will assay changes in markers of gametogenesis to determine how germ and niche cell
population are affected by aging and rejuvenation. Aim 2: I will use a panel of molecular biomarkers on
isolated gonads to determine if age-associated biomarkers accumulate in the gonads over time, and if
regeneration restores the gonads to a more youthful state. Aim 3: I will use selective mating experiments to
determine if impairments in fertility are due to defects in the testes, ovaries, or both. From these experiments, I
will learn more about the cellular, molecular, and physiological causes of germline aging in S. mediterranea,
and how regeneration manages to reverse them. These results will also help us understand why other
organisms are unable to prevent age-related gonadal degeneration, and potentially lay the groundwork for
more robust fertility treatments that extend or even restore fertility in humans."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common variants in ~200 genetic loci associated
with breast cancer risk. However, it is difficult to translate these findings to disease prevention and treatment
because causal genes and underlying mechanisms in these loci are largely unknown. Increasing evidence
suggests that epigenetic regulation may be on the causal pathway between genetic variants and diseases.
DNA methylation, one of the most frequent and important epigenetic modifications, plays a crucial role in
cancer development. However, it is almost impossible to collect pre-diagnostic breast tissues to profile the
methylome from a large number of participants. Herein, we propose a novel -omics approach: a methylation-
wide association study (MeWAS) using genetic instruments. In Aim 1, we will build race-specific prediction
models using genome wide methylation and genetic data in fresh-frozen breast samples from 600 cancer-free
women of African-, Asian- and European- ancestry (200 per race). These models will then be applied to the
GWAS data from three large consortia, including ~123,000 cases and ~106,000 controls of European, ~25,000
cases and ~25,000 controls of Asian-, ~20,000 cases and ~20,000 controls of African- ancestry to impute
methylation levels. The genetically predicted methylation levels will be tested in association with breast cancer
overall and by estrogen receptor and HER2 status. In Aim 2, we will perform a series of integrative functional
analyses to evaluate the functions of promising methylation sites and the potential target genes regulated by
these methylation sites. In Aim 3, we will select the top 20 methylation sites and their target genes for in vitro
functional assays to assess their influence on major cell functions related to cancer biology. Given the strong
pilot data, unique resources from three large genetic consortia, and our team's extensive expertise and
experience, we are uniquely positioned to conduct this project. The findings will greatly improve our
understanding of the genetic and biological basis of breast cancer pathogenesis and facilitate the translation of
genetic findings to prevention and treatment."
10783731,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fetal exposure to alcohol leads to a wide range of neurological deficits collectively termed fetal alcohol
spectrum disorder (FASD). This prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder currently affects as many as 1-5% of
school-aged children in the United States. Existing intervention strategies can improve the quality of life in
affected individuals, but early detection is critical for efficacious therapy. In utero MRI has benefited from recent
improvements in retrospective motion correction methods in 3D image reconstruction, and is a promising non-
invasive technique for identifying abnormal brain development associated with fetal exposure to alcohol. We
have recently developed a rhesus macaque model of FASD that resembles human drinking early in gestation,
prior to pregnancy awareness, but ceases upon recognition of pregnancy. Abnormal brain growth is apparent
at gestation day (G)135 by MRI in fetuses of rhesus macaques that orally self-administered 1.5 g/kg
(approximately 6 drinks) daily ethanol over the first 60 days of pregnancy. Compared to controls, ethanol-
exposed fetuses possessed brains with smaller cerebellums and less developed white matter fiber systems
involved in motor and cognitive function. Ex vivo electrophysiological recordings performed on the G135
fetuses demonstrated that the MRI-identified abnormalities are associated with functional impairments in
glutamatergic transmission. The experiments proposed in this application will determine the behavioral
consequences of these anatomical and functional abnormalities, and further extend the MRI and
electrophysiological characterization of this model of FASD. Twelve rhesus macaques exposed to daily
maternal 1.5 g/kg ethanol drinking over the first 60 days of gestation will be compared to 12 control animals. In
utero MRI will be performed at G135, and the offspring will be survived to postnatal day (P)180 (approximately
6 months of age). Additional MRI experiments will be performed on P3 and P180. Aim 1 of this proposal will
use fetal (G135) and postnatal MRI (P3 and P180) to define the long-term impact of ethanol exposure on brain
development. This Aim includes a primary analysis focused on brain structures identified to be different at
G135 and whole-brain analysis to define additional brain regions sensitive to fetal ethanol exposure. These
results will facilitate data reduction for the combined analyses with other experimental modalities in Aims 2 and
3. Aim 2 will examine impairments in motor behavior due to fetal ethanol exposure and define the underlying
neural circuitry. Aim 3 will define the impairments in cognitive function and emotional regulation induced by
fetal ethanol exposure and identify the developmental processes and specific brain regions associated with
these impairments."
10765679,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating motor neuron degenerative disease that leads to
paralysis and eventual death. ALS is a particular concern for veterans, as military service is associated with
increased risk of ALS. The root cause of ALS is the death of motor neurons; however, the modalities of motor
neuron death in ALS remain unclear. Ferroptosis is an oxidative, iron-dependent cell death mechanism. Results
from our prior research have shown that motor neurons are vulnerable to ferroptosis. Importantly, we showed
recently that increased defense against ferroptosis resulted in significantly increased lifespan and ameliorated
motor neuron degeneration in SOD1G93A mice, a widely used ALS mouse model, indicating that ferroptosis is
a targetable vulnerability of motor neurons. However, at present, key questions about the roles of ferroptosis in
motor neuron death of ALS remain unanswered. For example, it is unclear whether inhibition of ferroptosis at
symptomatic stage can retard progression of motor neuron disease, and the contributions of ferroptotic stress of
different cell types on pathogenesis of motor neuron disease remain unknown. To answer those questions, we
have generated a novel mouse model with inducible expression of Gpx4, the master defender of ferroptosis,
which allows us to inhibit ferroptosis genetically in both temporal and cell-type specific manners. In our
preliminary study, we have also identified a small molecule compound with the ability to retard ferroptosis of
motor neurons in vivo. To determine if ferroptosis-inhibiting compounds can retard motor neuron disease, we
will test the efficacy of this compound in SOD1G93A mice. The overall hypothesis tested in this project is:
inhibition of ferroptosis after disease onset will be effective in retarding progression of motor neuron disease and
ferroptosis inhibition retards motor neuron disease in a cell-type specific manner. The results from this project
will provide novel insights into the mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration of ALS, and importantly, could
lead to new therapeutic strategies for ALS."
10909827,"In individuals with psychosis cannabis is associated with worse prognosis, exacerbation of psychotic
symptoms, impaired cognition, functional disability, violence, increased frequency and duration of
hospitalizations, and elevated healthcare costs. Despite this, there are high rates of co-occurring cannabis use
in psychosis, and rising cannabis use amongst Veterans. With legalization, commercialization, and increasing
potency of cannabis and decreasing risk perception, there is cause for alarm especially for those with psychosis.
Critically, there are no proven or approved treatments for cannabis use disorder in individuals with psychosis.
While antipsychotic medications are useful for decreasing psychotic symptoms, they have little effect on
decreasing cannabis use. Although nascent research suggests that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
(rTMS) and psychosocial interventions (i.e., motivational enhancement therapy) may reduce cannabis use and/or
psychosis, responses have been mixed. One possible reason that treatments may fail is that they may rely on
intact synchronized neural activity necessary for information processing, learning and memory.
 Converging evidence suggest deficits in neural synchrony in regions involved in learning and memory are
implicated in the pathophysiology of psychosis and psychoactive effects of cannabis. In those with psychosis,
deficits in coordinated neural activity in theta (4-7Hz) and gamma (30-80Hz) ranges, which are centrally involved
in learning and cognition and particularly working memory (WM), have been observed. In vitro and in vivo studies
and our experimental work in healthy controls have shown cannabinoid receptor type 1 agonists decrease theta
and gamma synchrony and increase noise (random activity), as well as alter functional connectivity in the working
memory network (WMN). While a scant literature, experimental studies in psychosis have shown cannabinoids
increase cognitive dysfunction and reduced hippocampal-striatal functional connectivity during a learning task.
Despite these initial findings, further work is needed on the impact of cannabinoids on neural synchrony in those
with psychosis, as identifying implicated neural mechanisms may lead to development of new interventions.
 Powerful tools previously used to investigate neural synchrony and functional connectivity (coordinated
activity), such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging, can be
complemented with magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG is a non-invasive, functional measure of magnetic
fields produced by neural activity with excellent temporal and spatial resolution. MEG has been critical for
understanding neural synchrony and working memory in other disorders, like Alzheimer’s Disease. While MEG
is sensitive to tangential currents, EEG is sensitive to tangential and radial currents. Together, MEG and EEG
provide complementary information for more accurate determination of neural mechanisms. Despite this, there
have been no studies using MEG/EEG to investigate neural synchrony, cannabis, and psychosis in Veterans.
 To address these gaps, this CDA-2 aims to compare neural synchrony and clinical outcomes of cognition,
psychiatric symptoms (i.e., psychosis, trauma, and anxiety), and function in Veterans with psychosis and regular
cannabis use compared to non-using peers using simultaneous MEG/EEG, available for the first time within the
VA at VA Connecticut. The proposal will build on the Principal Investigator’s expertise in cannabis use and
cognition and provide the unique skills to support her long-term career goal of using advanced multimodal
neuroscience tools to investigate the impact of cannabinoids on Veterans as an independent VHA investigator.
 This study has the potential to reveal a sophisticated account of neural synchrony in this population with insight
into how it relates to cognition, psychiatric symptoms, and function. This advance in scientific knowledge may
yield significant translational clinical utility such that findings about regions of altered synchrony may provide
targets for the development of novel, more effective, interventions, such as cognitive remediation or rTMS to
address neural synchrony and enhance cognition in Veterans with psychosis and co-occurring cannabis use."
10878749,"Abstract
 The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is high in the Veteran population and this disorder is
linked to numerous cardiovascular, neurocognitive and metabolic abnormalities. Thus, OSA is a major health
concern in the Veteran population. Treatment of OSA in many cases does not lead to significant improvements
in outcome measures. This inadequacy may be a consequence of reduced treatment adherence with continuous
positive airway pressure (CPAP) or because the effect of CPAP on outcome measures is small or absent in
some patients despite adequate adherence. Consequently, innovative therapies that directly impact co-
morbidities linked to OSA or that increase CPAP adherence could lead to improved outcome measures. In the
recent funding cycle, we established that repeated daily exposure to mild intermittent hypoxia (MIH) coupled with
CPAP modifies autonomic nervous system activity and dramatically decreases blood pressure compared to
CPAP treatment alone. Because MIH was coupled with CPAP, the independent effect of MIH on blood pressure
was not established. Moreover, it was not established if these outcomes were sustained for a prolonged time
period (i.e. weeks to months).
 Although we obtained some indirect evidence that modifications in autonomic nervous system activity were
coupled to the reduction in blood pressure, we did not establish if modifications in microvascular function were
evident. Microvascular dysfunction together with sympatho-vagal imbalance may have consequences not only
for peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure but also for muscle perfusion and metabolism, thereby
limiting exercise performance and increasing fatigability in patients with OSA. Thus, reductions in blood pressure
and improvement in microvascular function following treatment with MIH might serve to improve exercise
capacity and reverse performance fatigue in individuals with OSA.
 Besides its potential effect on autonomic and cardiovascular function, we and others previously established
that acute exposure to MIH initiates sustained increases in upper airway muscle activity in humans. This
sustained increase is a form of respiratory plasticity known as long-term facilitation. However, in the absence of
CPAP we have shown that acute MIH immediately prior to or during sleep leads to increases in apnea severity.
This might occur because the manifestation of long-term facilitation is absent in the presence of hypocapnia.
Hypocapnia can be induced during sleep by the initiation of another form of plasticity known as progressive
augmentation. However, it is possible that the combination of daily exposure to MIH administered many hours
before the sleep period may mitigate the effects of progressive augmentation leading to increased upper airway
stability.
 Independent of this possibility, we showed in the previous funding cycle that increased upper airway stability
following treatment with MIH was coupled to a reduction in therapeutic CPAP and improved adherence.
However, improved adherence to CPAP might also be linked to an increase in the arousal threshold to both
respiratory and non-respiratory stimuli. All the uncertainties outlined above will be addressed in the present
proposal."
10738279,"Candida glabrata is an opportunistic fungal pathogen associated with high mortality and whose incidence is
increasing due to its high frequency of resistance to the widely used azole antifungal class. C. glabrata also
rapidly evolves resistance to echinocandins and can become multi-drug resistant and thus virtually impossible
to treat. Drug resistance in C. glabrata is acquired via specific genetic variants. C. glabrata is also notable for its
remarkable genetic diversity, manifested by a variety of karyotypes and high levels of short nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) among strains. However, how C. glabrata facilitates genetic instability is almost entirely
unknown. A major source of genetic instability in all examined biological systems are DNA double-strand breaks
(DSBs), which mediate chromosome rearrangements and are associated with high rates of point mutations in
nearby regions. Thus, both chromosome rearrangements and SNP variation across C. glabrata strains are
consistent with DNA DSBs being the major source of this genetic diversity. Indeed, our preliminary studies
showed that C. glabrata experiences DNA breaks and develops chromosome rearrangements and drug-resistant
mutations during its interaction with host cells, e.g., while residing in macrophages, and that deletion of DSB
repair gene RAD51 in C. glabrata significantly increases the emergence of drug-resistant mutants in the mouse
gastrointestinal colonization model. This proposal is based on the hypothesis that C. glabrata has evolved
mechanisms that facilitate genetic instability upon DNA damage and that to understand these mechanisms it is
necessary to understand how C. glabrata generates and processes DNA DSBs. In Specific Aim 1, we propose
to use DSB chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (DSB-ChIP-seq) and END-
seq (a highly sensitive, unbiased next-generation sequencing technique for quantitatively mapping DSBs at
nucleotide resolution across the genome) to identify “fragile” loci prone to DSB formation in C. glabrata, based
on the hypothesis that these loci are the most likely mediators of genetic instability. In Specific Aim 2, we will use
DSB-ChIP followed by mass spectrometry (DSB-ChIP-MS) to identify C. glabrata proteins that mediate DSB
transactions. In both Aims, the roles of selected identified loci/genes in DSB formation/processing and genome
stability will be validated experimentally. The proposed study will fill a large gap in knowledge and provide
information essential for understanding how C. glabrata promotes genetic diversity and evolves drug-resistant
variants. Karyotype instability and aberrant DSB repair are also hallmarks of many cancers, and in that context
understanding the mechanisms underlying DSB formation and processing has been instrumental in developing
effective therapeutic approaches targeting DSB repair mechanisms, e.g., by using PARP inhibitors. Thus, this
proposal will provide the first understanding of DSB formation and processing in C. glabrata and may identify its
“Achilles’ heel”, i.e., a mechanism that allows it to generate genetic diversity but also makes it more sensitive to
agents that disrupt or compromise DSB repair."

When entering college, similar numbers of underrepresented minority (URM) students plan to major in STEM
fields as non-Hispanic white students. However, pipeline leakage reduces the number of URM students entering
STEM careers following graduation. One way to address this pipeline leakage is via undergraduate research
experience, which improves retention of students in STEM disciplines and the pursuit of advanced degrees.
Given the benefits of undergraduate research experience, Temple University has programs that encourage
undergraduate participation in neuroscience and psychology research, such as an NIH ENDURE grant and
Independent Study credit options. However, these programs either require or prioritize students who can give a
2-year commitment. Thus, transfer students, students who are late to find their passion for research, and
students who do not know about or feel comfortable asking about research opportunities until later in training,
often miss out on the participating in undergraduate research. Additionally, Independent Study, which provides
most research opportunities to undergraduates, is compensated via course credit, which can be an impediment
for students who need to earn money to support their education (a large portion of Temple undergraduates). We
started the Building Research Independence by Developing Goals and Hands-on Experiences (BRIDGE)
program in 2021 to address these barriers. BRIDGE targets neuroscience and psychology majors who meet the
NIH guidelines for underrepresented populations and have not had the opportunity for research experience prior
to their last (typically senior) year of college. BRIDGE provides scholars with paid summer research experience,
individualized mentoring, and networking and professional development opportunities. This R25 grant would
increase the support for the existing BRIDGE program, allowing students to work full time over the summer and
providing travel funds, options that are not currently available. This funding would also support a near-peer
mentoring program where doctoral students would mentor BRIDGE scholars. Near-peer mentoring amplifies the
participation of underrepresented students in science by positively affecting both mentees and mentors. Overall,
the BRIDGE program will demystify the research process and provide more students underrepresented in
science with tools to pursue biomedical careers."
10734794,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The objective of this proposal is to develop a novel infant rhesus malaria challenge model and use this model to
determine how age impacts immune responses to malaria vaccination and protection at challenge. Malaria,
caused by Plasmodium parasites, is responsible for 225 million infections and 400,000 deaths per year. Malaria
burden is unevenly distributed by age, with infants and children suffering most. There is currently no licensed
malaria vaccine that can provide high level efficacy and reduce transmission in these populations. The most
advanced vaccine candidates target the malaria sporozoite and liver stages, which precede the symptomatic
blood stage of infection. These include the subunit vaccines RTS,S, R21, and ME-TRAP, and the live-attenuated
sporozoite vaccine PfSPZ. These vaccines confer protection by inducing anti-sporozoite antibodies or cytotoxic
T cells that kill infected cells in the liver. While these candidates have shown promising vaccine efficacy in adults,
age de-escalation trials have revealed vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy vary with age, with a trend for poorer
vaccine efficacy in younger infants. This has been attributed to the inherently tolerogenic nature of the infant
immune system, which gradually changes as the individual ages and becomes more immunologically mature.
Non-human primates (NHPs) are excellent models of the human immune system and pre-clinical studies in adult
rhesus macaques have directly informed malaria vaccine clinical trials. For vaccines that induce liver-specific T
cell responses, NHPs have been particularly valuable for identifying tissue correlates of protection since the liver
is typically inaccessible in vaccine clinical trials. Yet, despite infants and children being the target population for
malaria vaccines, there is currently no infant NHP challenge model for malaria vaccine evaluation. This proposal
will address this critical gap by establishing a novel infant rhesus malaria challenge model and using it to define
the effect of age on immune responses to malaria vaccination and protection at challenge. This model will use
the NHP-adapted Plasmodium knowlesi (Pk) malaria parasite and the well-characterized PkSPZ live-attenuated
sporozoite vaccine, which is equivalent to the PfSPZ vaccine recently tested in human infants. This vaccine
strategy is ideal as it is known to induce antibodies and T cell responses in both the periphery and liver and
confer substantial protection in adult rhesus macaques. The study design will age de-escalate and enroll one
cohort young adult animals and another of 5-12 month old infants. The hypothesis is that age-dependent
differences in peripheral and liver-specific immune responses to vaccination will result in decreased vaccine
efficacy in the infants. As it is infeasible to study vaccine-induced T cell responses in the liver of human infants,
this study will be the first to assess how the inherent characteristics of the developing infant immune system
impact liver T cell responses in a translationally relevant model. These studies aim to launch this novel infant
NHP research model and accelerate the development of a highly effective malaria vaccine for human infants."
10757647,"ABSTRACT
This proposal addresses the nature of interferon (IFN)-based antiviral responses at the oral mucosal barrier, and
the bacterial factors that impact their efficacy. IFNs are antiviral cytokines that are critical in limiting all aspects
of viral infection. We found that Type III IFNs or IFN lambdas (IFN-λs) are preferentially expressed by oral
epithelial cells, and IFN-λ-associated signaling confers robust, broad-spectrum, antiviral immunity at the oral
mucosal barrier. Bacterial colonizers at barrier sites have the potential to modulate host susceptibility to viral
infection. Consistent with this, we found that Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), which is associated with oral
dysbiosis and periodontal disease, singularly and totally dampened all aspects of IFN signaling in response to
viral agonists. The overall goal of this study is to characterize the effect of Pg-induced IFN-λ suppression on
viral clearance and neutrophil function, as well as determine the relevance of IFN-λ suppression for Pg
colonization. Our main hypothesis is that IFN-λ is preferentially induced at the oral mucosal barrier and confers
antiviral immune protection without inducing inflammation. Further, we hypothesize that Pg disengages both
homeostatic and inducible IFN-λ responses, thereby enhancing host susceptibility to oral viral infection and to
chronic inflammation, as well as contributing to Pg persistence. These hypotheses will be tested in the following
specific aims. Aim 1: Characterize the impact of Pg-mediated suppression of IFN-λ signaling on viral clearance
in vivo. Aim 2: Determine the contribution of IFN-λ mediated regulation of neutrophil effector functions to tissue
damage and persistent inflammation during oral viral infections. Aim3: Determine the role of inactivation of IFN
signaling in Pg persistence during infection. This study will provide fundamental novel information on the role of
Pg in the suppression of anti-microbial inflammatory responses at the oral mucosal barrier. Additionally, an
increased understanding of the factors that provide antiviral resistance in the oral cavity is highly significant as a
large number of viruses, including SARS-Cov2, can infect oral tissues and cause local and systemic disease."
10825520,"Sedentary behavior (spending most of the awake time in sitting/ recumbent posture) and physical inactivity
(lack of achieving weekly moderate/ vigorous physical activity goals) are not interchangeable terms but
represent distinct domains; one could be physically active and achieve the weekly goal of 150 min/week of
MVPA but still spend the rest of the awake hours sedentary. Technological advances have led to the
development of accelerometers for objectively measuring the posture, duration and intensity of physical
activities. “Pragmatic Evaluation of Events And Benefits of Lipid-lowering in older adults (PREVENTABLE)”
Trial is a NIA funded ongoing randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of a statin on cognitive function
and physical disability outcomes in older adults (age ≥ 75 years). The trial is in recruitment phase with a target
N of 20,000. Leveraging the resources of the parent study, we propose to recruit 2,500 participants in this
ancillary study and objectively measure sedentary, standing and stepping durations and the number of
steps/day with a validated accelerometer to examine two distinct questions of public health importance.
 First, higher levels of moderate/ vigorous physical activities have been associated with lower risk of
developing Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias (ADRD). However, physical inactivity and sedentary
behavior are distinct domains. Prospective longitudinal studies relating sedentary behavior with the risk of
ADRD are lacking. Hence, in the first specific aim, in a longitudinal, prospective analysis, we will examine the
hypothesis that longer sedentary duration increases risk of incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/ probable
ADRD; whereas, trade-off of sedentary duration for stepping duration is associated with lower risk of these
outcomes.
 Second, there are conflicting data on the associations of statins with physical disability/ physical activity.
PREVENTABLE is examining the possible role of atorvastatin in preventing disability (but not physical activity).
We propose to add objective measures of physical activity. In the second aim, we will examine the hypothesis
that decrease in physical disability and preservation of functional ability with randomization to atorvastatin
compared to placebo will result in higher physical activity levels and lower sedentary duration.
 The investigators on this multi-disciplinary team have the experience and expertise to carry out all aspects of
the project. The proposed ancillary study will be well integrated into the pragmatic design of the parent trial and
place minimal burden on participants and parent study staff. By adding rigorous measures of sedentary
behavior and physical activity, this ancillary study will create synergy with the parent trial to enhance scientific
yield by addressing an important gap in the parent study. If sedentary behavior is associated with incident MCI/
ADRD in older adults, the results of the current study will aid in the design of a future RCT to examine the
effect of a sedentary behavior intervention to prevent ADRD in older adults."

Insomnia is a highly prevalent condition that significantly degrades the quality of life and health of millions of
patients. By diagnostic definition, insomnia is a disease characterized by self-reported subjective criteria, thus
therapeutic developers targeting insomnia typically evaluate their treatment’s efficacy based on patient reported
outcomes in the form of sleep diaries. A critical flaw with this assessment approach is that self-perception of
sleep is inherently noisy due to the inability of patients to perceive the transition to and from unconscious sleep
and sources of variability related to bias, mood, and other contextual factors. To overcome this limitation, many
clinical trials incorporate clinically validated wearable devices into their trials as surrogate assessments which
are interpreted in conjunction with sleep diary data. Wearable devices are also imperfect tools to assess sleep
because they are similarly limited by non-disease, non-treatment related factors including imperfect operation,
imperfect algorithms, and misuse. Furthermore, numerous studies in clinical and non-clinical populations have
demonstrated that there are significant discrepancies between sleep diaries and wearable device derived sleep
metrics raising the question as to which assessment approach is valid. Without a method to reconcile differences
between sleep diaries and wearable devices the current practice for clinical trials is to rely on sleep diary data
which is suboptimal and may contribute to blunted or nonsignificant effects in trials. The improved patient
reported outcome (iPRO) – Sleep Diary is a method and system designed to improve sleep assessment by
combining sleep diary and wearable device data while maintaining the subjectivity of sleep assessment. The
proposed solution is to provide patients their wearable device-derived sleep data contemporaneously with the
completion of the sleep diary. The patient reported sleep diary measurement is still the outcome of interest,
however patients have the freedom to incorporate or disregard their objective data in their assessment. This
approach is inspired by signal processing theory where measurements from two sensors with uncorrelated
sources of error (sleep diary and wearable device) are combined to improve the measurement of the underlying
signal. The approach of providing patients their objective data and then using their sleep diary response (in
contrast to averaging) is used to preserve patient autonomy and leverage the benefits of self-reported data.
Preliminary data suggest the iPRO-Sleep Diary non-linearly improves measurement precision of sleep metrics
and reduces discrepancy between device and sleep diary data. This platform technology is expected to improve
the assessment of sleep in clinical trials and enable more efficient development of effective therapeutics."

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has set guidelines for illicit drug
monitoring for both screening and confirmatory tests. Point-of-care (POC) screening assays usually rely upon
immunoassays that lack specificity among compounds in a given drug class. Confirmation testing usually
employs chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), which is a powerful technique capable of
identifying the relevant analytes of interest in complex samples; however, this approach requires large,
expensive equipment that requires technical expertise to operate, thus precluding it from POC environments. In
this Fast-Track SBIR project, scientists at Axcend Corporation in collaboration with chromatography and drug
analysis experts in academia and advice from practicing health care professionals will pursue further
development of a compact capillary liquid chromatography (LC) platform for rapid POC screening of drugs of
abuse. In Phase I, sample preparation with a novel solid phase extraction (SPE) apparatus will be optimized and
automated, a longer pathlength UV absorption detector flow cell will be created, and capillary LC stationary
phases and mobile phases will be investigated and selected to achieve SAMHSA testing concentration cutoff
limits for relevant compounds using the compact LC system. In Phase II, novel column-column and column-
detector combinations, diode-array detection modules, and data processing approaches combining
chromatographic retention times and UV absorption ratios will be developed to enhance the analysis of these
compounds and provide timely information to support urgent patient treatment decisions. Key aspects of this
proposal that are unique to advancing the field of POC chemical analysis using capillary LC are (1) improved
sensitivity using novel simple off-line and on-line extraction and concentration devices, and a longer pathlength
UV-absorption flow cell; (2) combinations of columns, solvents, and modes of operation for maximum LC
separation, and (3) enhanced selectivity of detection using innovative tandem column–UV-detector
combinations, (4) a new compact DAD UV-absorption detector for capillary LC, and (5) unique data handling
software algorithms for peak deconvolution. These innovations are new to the area of POC analysis as well as
to the broad field of capillary LC in general. The results from this project will be a critical step towards the release
of a POC drug screening solution that provides improved patient care compared to current healthcare practices."

Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes (CMS) are a group of clinically similar neuromuscular transmission
disorders that differ in their underlying genetic mutation. While some phenotypical variation exists, CMS are
commonly characterized by muscle weakness (myasthenia) that worsens with physical exertion. Defects in
Collagen Q (ColQ), a multidomain functional protein of the Neuro Muscular Junction (NMJ) responsible for
AChEticholinesterase (AChE) anchoring and Muscle specific Kinase (MusK) phosphorylation, lead to
endplate AChE deficiency and ColQ CMS. ColQ CMS is a severe, pediatric orphan disease with a prevalence
of approximately 1,600 people in the major developed countries. Severe ColQ CMS can result in early death
and causes decreased Quality of Life due to extreme fatigability, dependency on intermittent respiratory
support, and/or tube feeding, which occurs in 2/3 of patients by early adulthood. No cure nor standardized
treatment has been yet developed for ColQ CMS. While some CMS subtypes are managed via administration
of AChE inhibitors, ColQ CMS is refractory and can deteriorate if treated with AChE inhibitors. Best available
care involves chronic administration of ?2-adrenergic receptor agonists, which only provide modest
symptomatic improvements. Amplo Biotechnology is developing treatments for CMS, seeking to streamline
the process of testing new adeno-associated virus (AAV) by applying a platform approach whereas, by using
the same gene delivery system and manufacturing methods, subsequent indications can be targeted by
changing the animal model and the transgene delivered. This approach will save time, money and will
ultimately allow to address the unmet needs of smaller patients’ populations where traditional drug
development investments cost are commercially unviable. AMP-201, is the first gene therapy product for
ColQ CMS, based on an AAV8 vector carrying the human ColQ gene. The development pathway presented
has been based on regulatory (pre-IND, pre-CTA) and scientific advice (TACT, Treat-NMD) provided for a
closely related gene therapy that Amplo is developing for Dok-7 CMS (Fast-track SBIR recently awarded).
Preliminary results in a ColQ CMS mouse model show that intra-venous injection of a AAV8-COLQ is able
to correct the pathological signs of AMP-201 in the ColQ -/- mice model which recapitulates the phenotype of
ColQ CMS. AMP-201 will enable a shift in the current clinical practice from chronic administration of drugs to
alleviate symptoms to a one-off treatment allowing physicians to treat the entire affected population, curing
adult disease, and stopping disease progression in children. The goal of this STTR Fast-Track project is to
validate the efficacy and safety of using AMP-201 for ColQ CMS. Amplo will use Phase I activities to perform
a pre-clinical dose-finding and efficacy study in ColQ -/- mice. The outcome of Phase I activities will be used
to direct toxicity studies in mice and pivotal DMPK/ADME and toxicology in non-human primates (NHP) in
Phase II. Manufacturing, quality, and stability procedures will also be defined."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health issue globally, and while neuroimaging has been useful in
understanding disruption in brain structure and function after injury, there are a number of factors that attenuate
its prognostic ability. For example, there is tremendous heterogeneity in outcome after injury which is only
partially explained by injury severity. Cost frequently limits sample size in neuroimaging studies, yet given the
myriad factors that have been shown to influence patient outcome (age, injury severity, socioeconomic status),
small samples and mass univariate testing often result in many studies being grossly under-powered. One
solution is to combine data and create novel data sharing platforms, and the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics
through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium has supported this kind of collaboration for over a decade across
a range of clinical disorders. The goal of this proposal is to develop tools and data processing procedures for
use in the ENIGMA Brain Injury working group. In the R61 phase, we aim to develop and test a workflow for
harmonized processing of behavioral data (Aim 1) as well as structural and functional (resting-state) MRI data
(Aim 2). For Aim 1 of the R61, the goal is to offer a decision tree of procedures that is data-dependent, allowing
investigators to establish common cognitive endpoints across cohorts that collect a range of neuropsychological
and clinical measures. This proposal will create sharable procedures, flexible tools, and generalizable guidelines
for best practices for extracting common cognitive endpoints from distinct behavioral test batteries (R61 Aim 1).
In Aim 2 of the R61, we develop an image processing pipeline called Harmonization and Aggregation for
Functional and structural imaging data PIPEline; HAF-PIPE) that allows for aggregation of non-equivalent
imaging data. A primary goal is to decentralize ComBat, an open-source data harmonization tool, so that it can
be used in a virtual sharing environment. Following satisfaction of the R61 Go/No-Go criteria, which is the
curation of the dataset including 13 cohorts, extraction of common cognitive endpoints, and creation of HAF-
PIPE, we will move to the R33 phase. In the R33 phase, we will leverage the large, harmonized dataset and
apply a machine learning technique (CorEx - Correlation Explanation) to identify patient clusters within each
patient population studied. HAF-PIPE and the procedures and guidelines from the R61 phase will then be
extended to additional patient populations and made available to other ENIGMA working groups. The
harmonized data, along with the tools and procedures for creating them, will be accessible to researchers
following proposal submission and approval as a curated dataset. With success, this proposal holds the promise
of significantly advancing data curation, harmonization, and sharing in the clinical neurosciences. We anticipate
that our proposal will significantly advance our understanding of factors that impact outcome after injury and will
yield a tool that will be useful across the neuroimaging community."
10837752,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As the nation continues to grapple with rising alcohol-related hospitalization and mortality, expanding access to
alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment remains an urgent public health priority. While Medicaid is positioned to
be a key policy lever to improve access to AUD treatment and reduce mortality among vulnerable populations,
many state Medicaid programs do not cover the full continuum of AUD treatment and use utilization
management parameters that may restrict access. Moreover, most state Medicaid programs contract with
managed care organizations (MCOs). While over 70% of all Medicaid enrollees participate in MCO plans, little
is known about how these plans cover AUD treatment. To fill this gap in the scientific evidence, we will conduct
the first multi-state study of the effects of Medicaid MCO coverage and utilization management design on AUD
treatment receipt and outcomes. The study will encompass 142 MCO plans, across 18 states, for the full
continuum of treatment. We also propose to make use of innovative random auto-assignment methods in two
state Medicaid programs. Our specific aims will include: (1) estimating how MCO plans’ coverage and
utilization management designs are associated with progression through the major stages of identification and
treatment of AUD (diagnosis, initiation, engagement, and retention); (2) estimating how MCO plans’ coverage
and utilization management parameters are associated with alcohol-related emergency department visits and
hospitalizations; and (3) estimating how progression through the stages of identification and treatment of AUD
is associated with alcohol-related mortality. The proposed study will be the first comprehensive investigation of
the effects of MCO coverage for AUD treatment on treatment receipt and outcomes – evidence without which
the care of a large fraction of the AUD population is compromised. As alcohol-related hospitalization and
mortality continue to rise, evidence regarding the impact of Medicaid MCO coverage for AUD treatment is
urgently needed. This research will equip policymakers with evidence-based guidance on how to structure
MCO contractual arrangements to ensure appropriate and efficient access to AUD treatment.

10831972,"Abstract:
A strong link between early life stress/adversity (ELS/ELA) and age-related disorders, such as cardiometabolic
disease, cognitive and psychiatric/neurological disorders, have been established mostly based on retrospective
human reports. Yet, prospective, longitudinal, studies across the life span are critical to identify biomarkers of
ELA risk embedded earlier in life, during middle age to develop early intervention strategies. Animal models
with short life spans (invertebrates, rodents) have significant limitations to inform about human aging and the
therapeutics developed from those models have failed in clinical trials. Longitudinal nonhuman primate (NHP)
studies could provide significant information on early biological and neural markers of ELA-related cognitive
decline due to their long life span and gradual aging-related cognitive impairments and brain pathology similar
to those in humans emerging in middle age. This proposal builds on our data linking ELA in macaques with
early markers of accelerated cellular aging (accelerated DNA methylation age, shortened telomere length),
inflammation, and neurocognitive alterations detectable from infancy to young adulthood. The goal is to use a
prospective, longitudinal design in NHPs to identify early biomarkers/pathways and underlying mechanisms of
ELA-related accelerated neural aging trajectories and cognitive decline from young adulthood to middle age.
This unique population of adult female macaques with ELA (social subordination stress) are currently living in
social groups at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center and were longitudinally characterized from birth
through puberty as part of NIH-funded studies. These animals (High-ELA: subordinates; low-ELA: dominant)
will be studied longitudinally between 7(early adulthood) and 11 (middle age) years of age. Aim 1 will examine
trajectories of ELA-accelerated neural aging in brain regions that control cognitive and stress/emotional
functions studied in Aim 2 (prefrontal cortex -PFC-, hippocampus -HIPP-, amygdala); it will use (a) MRI, DTI
and resting state fMRI to examine myelin loss, cortical thinning and loss of long-range connectivity; (b)
measures of neuropathology with MR spectroscopy (reductions in N-Acetylaspartate) and markers preceding
dementia in humans (reduced amyloid β(Aβ42)/tau ratio in CSF); and (c) markers of neuroinflammation and
neurotoxicity (CSF levels of kynurenine pathway metabolites). Aim 2 will test whether ELA accelerates age-
related deficits in stress/emotional regulation mediated by PFC-amygdala circuits (HPA axis, Human Intruder
and dot-probe tasks), and cognition: attention (continuous performance task), executive function and cognitive
flexibility mediated by PFC circuits (Intradimensional/Extradimensional discrimination), and spatial relational
memory mediated by HIPP-PFC circuits (spatial memory span). Aim 3 will examine associations between
longitudinal trajectories of neural measures (Aim 1) and cognitive outcomes (Aim 2); we will use innovative
longitudinal statistical approaches developing individualized trajectory biomarkers of risk and resilience that
move beyond association to establishing statistical causation. The hypothesis is that the ELA group will show
early biomarkers of stress and accelerated trajectories of biological and neurocognitive aging in middle age."
10841412,"Project Summary:
 Revolutionary advancements in pacemakers include a miniaturized and leadless design and intracardiac
implantation. However, the bulky and rigid battery creates the largest hurdle towards further development of a soft
system that can be attached and conform to tissue and muscle surfaces without causing unwanted physiologic
changes. To address this critical challenge, this project proposes to develop a self-sustainable power source
(SSPS) for intracardiac pacemakers using swine models. The SSPS integrates a stretchable, frequency-tuning
implantable nanogenerator (i-NG) with a miniaturized supercapacitor and regulating electronics, which can
automatically and consistently power a pacemaker by harvesting energy from heartbeats.
 This project is led by Dr. Wang (PI), with Drs. Hacker and Liu as the co-Is and a cardiac surgeon Dr. Osaki as
collaborator, for the development of a flexible i-NG to harvest energy from biomechanical sources. Previous work from
Wang and Hacker has confirmed the long-term stability of i-NGs and their negligible impacts on normal heart functions
when sutured on swine hearts. Wang has also developed a flexible, micro-grating i-NG capable of converting slow
organ motion to continuous alternating current (AC) electricity desired for efficient capacitor charging. Building on
these supportive preliminary results, this project focuses on designing and validating a SSPS specifically for powering
intracardiac pacemakers by harvesting energy from heartbeats. In Specific Aim 1, we will develop a stretchable SSPS
that integrates a flexible i-NG with a commercial supercapacitor and regulating electronics. The membrane i-NG can
convert heart beats into continuous, high-frequency AC electricity with an output voltage suitable for efficiently
charging the supercapacitor. In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate the bio- and hemo-compatibility of SSPS ex vivo
and test the SSPS device in a simulated intracardiac environment. In Specific Aim 3, we will characterize electrical
output of SSPS in vivo epicardially in different locations and orientations on the epicardial surface of the right ventricle
(RV) of swine hearts. Cardiac function will be monitored over time to ensure SSPS implantation does not alter heart
function. The ability to power a commercial pacemaker will also be tested in vivo. In Specific Aim 4, we will investigate
intracardiac implantation of SSPS on the internal RV free wall of a surgically removed and beating swine heart on a
Langendroff apparatus to test the intracardiac operation ex vivo.
 This proposed research will develop a novel intracardiac energy harvester that is self-sustainable by harvesting
biomechanical energy from heartbeats. Success of this research will establish a technology framework necessary to
move rapidly to in vivo intracardiac implantation and testing of SSPS for powering intracardiac pacemakers . This
intracardiac energy harvesting technique will present an unprecedented engineering solution to address the power
supply challenges for the next generation intracardiac pacemakers by altering flexibility, decreasing size, improving
safety, and eliminating the battery component."

Diversity is essential to maximize scientific rigor, innovation, and generalizability in alcohol research. However,
a lack of participation by investigators and trainees from diverse ethnic and racial groups, disability status, and
disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds is a persistent challenge. Investigators from the field of psychology
are vital in the conduct of interdisciplinary alcohol research and evidence-supported treatment provision, and
integral to the dissemination and implementation of novel behavioral, pharmacological, and combined treatment
approaches for alcohol use disorders. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed alcohol research training
program, titled Enhancing Diversity in Alcohol Research (EDAR), is to address this critical need by increasing
engagement and retention of URM psychology trainees in alcohol research careers. The EDAR program is
aligned with NIAAA’s longstanding mission to support diversity in education, the NIAAA Strategic Plan for 2017-
2021, and the NIAAA Working Group on Diversity and Health Disparity. The specific aims of the EDAR program
are to: 1) attract URM psychology trainees into internship programs with robust alcohol research training
opportunities by providing individualized mentoring from near-peers and senior experts in the alcohol field,
structured didactics focused on diversity and professional development, and financial support, 2) retain URM
psychology trainees in alcohol research careers by engaging them in NIAAA-supported T32 programs and
providing them the skills to become near-peer mentors, 3) examine the effects of the program on research
engagement and career trajectories following program completion, and 4) identify barriers and facilitators to
engaging and retaining URM trainees in alcohol research. Each year, we will recruit and retain cohorts of six
outstanding psychology graduate students from diverse backgrounds during the summer before internship
application. The proposed EDAR program will provide two years of formalized didactic training and individual
mentorship including: personalized feedback on internship and postdoctoral fellowship application materials,
interview skill development, and financial support to offset trainee application and interview expenses. Thorough
program evaluation will occur with direction from an expert panel of federally-funded alcohol researchers and
educators in our Advisory Council to refine and improve the program and provide innovative data on potential
barriers and facilitators to alcohol research involvement for trainees from diverse backgrounds. The highly
qualified leadership team, strong partnerships with senior alcohol investigators leading NIAAA-supported
T32/T35 training programs, and a team of exceptionally qualified and dedicated faculty mentors will ensure that
the proposed alcohol research education program is implemented with a focus on rigor, cultural sensitivity, and
sustainability within a vibrant educational setting."
10834034,"NAACCR Annual Scientific Conference Project Summary R13 20-207
Cancer surveillance data are the lynchpin of the cancer data ecosystem. Only through the collection
of accurate, standardized, curated data on every cancer patient in the U.S. can we truly monitor and
evaluate our progress against cancer. The goal of this application is to convene annual conferences
that will strengthen collaboration between the cancer surveillance community and cancer
researchers to maximize the impact of cancer registries in advancing our scientific understanding.
NAACCR has hosted the most influential and informative annual conference for cancer surveillance
scientists in North America for over 30 years. It is the largest meeting of its kind for population-based
cancer registries to participate in the advancement of cancer surveillance data science, learn new
techniques, exchange information, and develop efficient and cost-effective work practices. This
year, renowned speakers and surveillance experts will highlight changes in cancer care, data
sources, technology, and research requirements and focus on integrating with cancer surveillance
so as to make cancer registries more useful and accessible to researchers.
The objective of this conference grant is to: Convene a conference for cancer researchers, NAACCR
members and the cancer surveillance community to demonstrate the utility and value of cancer
surveillance data in a wide array of cancer research applications, including cancer control, cohort
matching through the NAACCR Virtual Pooled Registry, clinical surveillance,
pharmacoepidemiology, and population-based site specific prognostic indicators. Cancer
surveillance data forms the backbone of countless cancer research studies each year.
The methods used will be the planning and implementation of a world-class scientific conference,
with workshops, break-out sessions, panel discussions, keynotes, plenaries, and posters. In
addition, we plan to encourage attendance and enhance diversity by subsidizing registration for
delegates from under-resourced countries. Awards will be based on need and/or guidelines of NCI’s
Office of Global Health. Due to ongoing uncertainty around travel restrictions and social distancing
measures resulting from the COVID-19 global pandemic, we plan to use a hybrid in-person/virtual
conference model in 2021 and, potentially, subsequent years. Making some portion of the
conference available via an online virtual format allows us to achieve our specific aims while
accommodating the needs of attendees.
The NAACCR meeting is the only cancer surveillance meeting that draws participation from every
state and province in U.S. and Canada. This conference provides an excellent opportunity for
participation by groups that are often under-represented in science, particularly women and
minorities, and the location of the conference is selected to ensure a mix of regional, national and
international participation and representation."
10799611,"Project Summary
 A true enigma of modern medicine has persisted for over 150 years; the mechanism(s) by which
volatile anesthetics (VAs) produce reversible loss of consciousness remains an unsolved mystery. Using
genetic approaches, we demonstrated that mitochondrial complex I, an entry point of the mitochondrial
electron transport chain, specifically controls the sensitivity of multiple species, including worms and
humans, to VAs. These broad phylogenetic effects indicate that an ancient mechanism is at hand, linking
mitochondrial function to synaptic silencing in the presence of VAs.
 We began mechanistic studies in mice by exploiting Ndufs4(KO), a mouse defective in complex I
function and extremely hypersensitive to VAs. Testing cell-specific Ndufs4(KO) mice, we found that VA
sensitivity was fully controlled by glutamatergic KO, with no effect of loss of NDUFS4 from GABAergic or
cholinergic neurons. Surprisingly, an astrocytic-specific KO of NDUFS4 was defective only in arousal from
VAs. Preliminary data indicate that neurons in the locus coeruleus mediate this effect. This novel role of
astrocytes offers a new approach to investigate crucial arousal pathways. In addition, we are exploring the
mechanisms underlying anesthetic induced neurotoxicity (AIN). From our work in nematodes, we have
identified new candidate molecules that can be tested as AIN therapies in mice. We showed that inhibition
of the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum, or inhibition of mTOR, a cellular metabolic
switch, alleviated AIN in worms. We are exploring the roles of these pathways in AIN, and relating them to
exciting new data which indicate that VAs themselves produce metabolic changes specific to neonatal mice.
 Many questions remain unanswered. 1. How do complex I defects control VA sensitivity. We
showed that excitatory neurotransmission in Ndufs4(KO) was hypersensitive to isoflurane inhibition
compared to WT. Our recent data suggest that isoflurane inhibits synaptic endocytosis in both WT and KO
animals and that this inhibition results from a decrease in ATP production. Our aims are to characterize the
mechanism underlying inhibition of neurotransmitter endocytosis by VAs. 2. What pathways transduce
AIN in neonatal mice; how can those pathways be inhibited? We are extending C. elegans studies to
test exciting new small molecule candidates that may alleviate AIN in mice. We are also exploring ER-stress
and mTOR activity as potential signaling pathways mediating AIN in mice. 3. How does mitochondrial
function in astrocytes control arousal from the anesthetized state? We are studying astrocyte
signaling to determine how astrocytes affect synaptic function during and following VA exposure.
 Astrocyte/neural pathways necessary for emergence from the anesthetized state will be
investigated. Mitochondrial function is linked to behavior in VAs in worms, mice, and man. Our proposed
studies are aimed to identify the basic, molecular mechanisms of action of VAs."
10791924,"Project Summary/Abstract
tRNAs are well-known as the physical adaptors of the genetic code, bridging codon-
based information with the appropriate amino acids required for protein translation. tRNA
function can be regulated by a wide variety of mechanisms, including the modulation of
tRNA aminoacylation by cellular amino acid levels. Two previously underappreciated
mechanisms have recently emerged as key regulators of tRNA biology – covalent
modifications of tRNA nucleotides, and cleavage of tRNAs, which generates stable and
potentially functional tRFs.
 Here, we propose to investigate the regulation of tRNA cleavage, and the
functions of resulting tRNA fragments, in budding yeast and in mammalian embryonic
stem cells. First, as tRNA nucleotide modifications have been shown to interfere with
tRNA cleavage in several model organisms, we will first survey the effects of all known
tRNA modifications on tRNA cleavage in yeast. Deep sequencing of small RNAs will be
carried out for a large collection of yeast deletion mutants – covering all nonessential
tRNA-modifying enzymes known at present – following overexpression of various tRNA
nucleases. In parallel, we will develop a comprehensive panel of conditional mutants in
tRNA modification machinery in murine ES cells to extend these studies to a mammalian
model.
 A complementary effort will focus on the roles for tRNA fragments in translational
control. Again comparing yeast and mammals, we will characterize translation by
ribosome footprinting in wild-type and in mutants lacking tRNA cleavage or various tRNA
modifications. To allow biochemical access to specific tRNA fragment activities, we will
use in vitro translation systems to directly investigate the roles for various purified or
synthetic tRNA fragments at well-defined stages of protein translation.
 Together, these experiments systematically address the roles for tRNA
modifications in tRNA cleavage and control of translation by resulting tRNA fragments,
providing important insights with relevance to diseases ranging from neurodegeneration
to cancer."
10925147,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the 3rd leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. and is generally
refractory to chemotherapy. We discovered that the harsh PDA microenvironment primes cancer cells against
additional cytotoxic insults (e.g., chemotherapy) and promotes PDA aggressiveness. A better understanding of
the molecular underpinnings behind this adaptive program would expose PDAs metabolic vulnerabilities. We
identified the RNA binding protein, HuR (ELAVL1), as a major player in the acute pro-survival response. Upon
stress, HuR translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm with key survival transcripts, like IDH1 (an NADPH
generating enzyme). HuR enhances RNA stability and protein translation of target mRNAs, to rapidly adjust the
transcriptome in response to stress. Our research highlights two metabolic processes in the HuR adaptive
program: a) antioxidant defense and b) mitochondrial performance. HuR silencing in PDA cells produced
excessive ROS and NADPH depletion under low glucose or chemotherapy stress. An unbiased RNA seq
analysis of antioxidant genes in HuR deficient cells identified IDH1 as the leading antioxidant enzyme under
HuR control. RNA binding and RNA stability assays showed that HuR regulates IDH1 post-transcriptionally,
and HuR deficient PDA cells had markedly reduced IDH1 mRNA and protein expression. HuR-deficient cells
failed to engraft in nude mice, while IDH1 overexpression rescued PDA engraftment. HuR-deficient cells also
had dysfunctional mitochondria, reflected by reduced oxygen consumption, ATP, and mitochondrial
abundance. Based on this body of work, we hypothesize that PDAs reliance on HuR under low nutrient
conditions exposes new therapeutic opportunities. In Aim 1, we establish the survival impact of the HuR-
IDH1 axis, by editing out HuR binding sites (CRISPR) in the IDH1 3’UTR. We generated a conditional IDH1
knockout mouse, and will cross it with an established PDA model to validate IDH1 as a therapeutic target. We
will test an allosteric modulator of mutant IDH1 (GSK-321) as a novel wild type IDH1 inhibitor in PDA, and
launch hit-to-lead optimization to improve drug properties. In Aim 2, we identify specific aspects of
mitochondrial biology under HuR control through studies of mitochondrial structure and function in HuR-
deficient PDA cells. The importance of the HuR-IDH1 axis on mitochondrial ROS levels will be demonstrated.
Additional transcripts will impact HuR’s regulation of mitochondrial performance will be identified. A novel
mitochondrial inhibitor, CPI-613, will be combined with HuR or IDH1 inhibition as a new synthetic lethal
approach against PDAs adaptive metabolic program. In Aim 3, we will use a diabetic mouse model to show
that a hyperglycemic state suppresses the HuR pro-survival network, and sensitizes PDA to chemotherapy.
Successful engraftment of HuR-deficient cells in hyperglycemic mice would suggest that HuR is less important
under these conditions. Our studies of HuR biology will improve understanding of PDA metabolic tendencies,
and reveal therapeutic opportunities relevant to PDAs nutrient deprived microenvironment."
10816995,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Up to 12% of pregnant women have a new episode of depression, ie, an incident or recurrent depressive
episode with symptom onset during pregnancy. Effects of untreated antenatal depression include unhealthy
maternal behaviors (eg, diminished self-care, smoking, substance use, self-harm) and emotional and
behavioral problems in offspring. Antenatal depression or elevated depression scores, identified by screening
instruments, increase the risk of preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), and small for gestational age
(SGA) birth, and are associated with breastfeeding discontinuation before 3 months postpartum. In-person
psychotherapy and antidepressant medication improve depression symptoms in many with depression, yet
<50% of pregnant women with new episodes of depression initiate these treatments. Although some barriers to
initiating antidepressants and psychotherapy are known, other factors have not been well described, especially
after accounting for depression severity. Furthermore, the impact of antidepressants and psychotherapy on
perinatal outcomes, including PTB, LBW, SGA, and breastfeeding continuation among pregnant women with
new episodes of depression after accounting for confounding by depression severity is unknown.
Given the importance of factors influencing the decision to initiate antidepressant or psychotherapy treatment
during pregnancy and the need for further evidence on the perinatal risks and benefits associated with
antidepressant use and psychotherapy in pregnant women, the goal of this study is to identify predictors and
perinatal effects of psychotherapy and antidepressant use for new episodes of depression during pregnancy
while accounting for depression severity. We will conduct this study in a racially and ethnically diverse multi-
site population using electronic health data, enriched with survey data from a subset of women.
Among pregnant women with new episodes of depression, we will evaluate factors that influence the
propensity to initiate psychotherapy or antidepressants; accounting for these is crucial when studying treatment
effects. We will describe patterns of use of alternative depression management approaches (eg, Internet-
based psychotherapy, peer support groups, and complementary and alternative medicine) and will evaluate
whether initiation of psychotherapy or antidepressants is associated with these practices while accounting for
depression severity. We will quantify the impact of psychotherapy and antidepressants (including dose, timing,
and duration of use) on PTB, LBW, SGA, and breastfeeding continuation accounting for the propensity to
initiate psychotherapy or antidepressants and depression severity.
We are uniquely positioned to overcome limitations of confounding and small size in prior studies given our
data on depression severity and maternal comorbidity for more than 8,000 pregnant women. Our study will be
informative for understanding the mental health interventions utilized by pregnant women with depression and
will inform decision making on optimal depression management during pregnancy."
10804614,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This project investigates the role of the early life gut microbiota in the development of the enteric nervous
system, which controls gastrointestinal (GI) motility. As the most common reason for referral to a
gastroenterologist, chronic motility disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) cost the nation an
estimated $30 billion annually and reduce quality of life for millions of Americans. Though motility disorders are
generally first diagnosed and then managed in adulthood, retrospective patient accounts and several other
lines of evidence implicate early life microbiota-enteric nervous system (ENS) interactions in adult dysmotility.
Despite this evidence, however, no studies to date have mechanistically interrogated how disruptions to the gut
microbiota during early life influence the severity and reversibility of chronic dysmotility. However, our
preliminary data suggest the presence of a critical window of postnatal development, in which metabolites
produced by gut microbes affect Wnt signaling extracellular matrix (ECM) structures in the adult ENS and have
long-term implications for host motility. These findings lead us to hypothesize that 1) disruption or depletion of
gut microbes during a critical window of postnatal development impairs adult GI motility, and 2) these effects
are partially mediated by butyrate-induced epigenetic regulation of Wnt signaling affecting ENS maturation and
are limited after critical period closure by perineuronal net (PNN)-like ECM structures.
We will interrogate these hypotheses using controlled microbial manipulations at several developmental stages
in gnotobiotic and conventionally raised mouse models, coupled with functional motility assays, innovative
multiscale imaging modalities, and single cell transcriptomics and epigenomics. The proposed studies form an
integral part of a fellowship training plan, which takes advantage of state-of-the-art research facilities at the
University of Chicago Digestive Diseases Research Core Center, as well as the expertise of collaborators at
the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratories, and the Mayo Clinic. The collective resources and
expertise to be utilized in this training plan not only will be instrumental for the applicant's development as a
future physician-scientist, but will also provide insights into the fundamental significance of environmental
disturbances during development, and the relevance of such disturbances for GI health. We anticipate that
imprinting processes early in life may be reprogrammed by restoring key developmental factors, depending on
the age at which intervention occurs. Such insights will be critical for the prevention of motility disorders and for
developing effective therapies for the millions of patients whose quality of life is harmed by chronic dysmotility."
10834898,"For decades, there has been a critical gap in translating preclinical work on mechanisms of cerebral edema in
traumatic brain injury (TBI) to clinically available targeted therapies that improve outcome. This is important
because cerebral edema management commands substantial clinical and financial resources in severe TBI, yet
it remains a common cause of death and disability. Current treatments are indiscriminate, reactionary and morbid
- none improve outcome. Guideline-based protocols use a templated approach to this immensely complex
process without addressing individual differences in contributory pathways or edema endophenotypes. The long
-term goal is to harness relevant individual data (genetic, molecular, imaging, physiologic) to direct a precision
medicine approach to treat TBI edema and related contusion expansion. This R01 focuses on logical next steps
to address existing knowledge gaps in a unique, key edema pathway involving Sulfonylurea receptor-1 (Sur1)
and its regulated cation channel Trpm4. Promising results from Sur-1 inhibition (Glyburide, GLY) in preclinical
and early clinical brain injury trials have generated exciting momentum in this pathway. The objective of this
translational R01 is to define the impact of Sur1-Trpm4 related genetic and protein variability on different edema
endophenotypes, contusion growth and response to inhibition in preclinical and human TBI. The rationale is that
identifying these individual differences directly informs patient risk-stratification, prognosis, trial design, and
targeted therapy; ultimately improving outcome. The central hypothesis is that Sur1 protein expression and
genetic variability influence the endophenotype, extent, and therapeutic response of TBI edema. Aim 1 defines
correlations between Sur1-Trpm4 expression and MRI edema endophenotypes in three clinically relevant
complementary mouse models. Aim 2 tests effects of Sur1 inhibition (GLY, inducible knockout) in these models
on MRI edema endophenotypes, contusion, and outcome. Aim 3 identifies impact of genetic variation in the Sur1
pathway on TBI edema and contusion growth (on imaging) in a single-center human test-cohort, and a
multicenter validation-cohort. The work is feasible as shown by robust preliminary results and the tools, expertise
and track record of successful collaborations among coinvestigators. This work is innovative in concept and
methodology: it shifts a guideline-based paradigm toward precision medicine, links clinically measurable edema
endophenotypes (MRI) with a molecular pathway and targeted inhibition in different TBI models, and uses a
novel transgenic mouse to generate Sur1-Trpm4 expression maps. This research is significant, with high impact
if successful: linking Sur1-Trpm4 expression and inhibition to MRI endophenotypes (Aims 1-2) directly translate
to identifying appropriate patients for targeted therapy and trials. Distinguishing high vs low risk genetic profiles
(Aim-3) will identify patients in whom Sur1-Trpm4 is a major contributor to TBI edema and contusion growth, and
channel inhibition may be highly beneficial- directing clinical care and trials. Ultimately, such knowledge has the
potential to transform precision-medicine care of this devastating secondary injury and improve TBI outcome."

Program Abstract
Biology is increasingly becoming an information-driven science. To harness the opportunities of the post-
genomic era in furthering health sciences research and improving health care, there is an enormous demand for
biologists who are trained in mathematics and computer science and can think quantitatively. However, current
disciplinary graduate training programs are not designed to accommodate these rapid changes in the biological
research perspective. This need serves as the motivation for the development of specialized graduate training
programs that will train students at the interface between biology, engineering and computer science. To address
this need, UCSD established an interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Bioinformatics in 2001 under the
directorship of Dr. Shankar Subramaniam. In 2008, it was renamed Graduate Program in Bioinformatics and
Systems Biology and reorganized. The current program directors Drs. Trey Ideker, Euegene Yeo, and Theresa
Gaasterland work closely with the Training Grant co-PIs Dr. Subramaniam, Vineet Bafna, and Theresa
Gaasterland, and with an active steering committee containing representative faculty from all five participating
UCSD schools and academic divisions. The primary objectives of this (renewal) application of the Training Grant
by the three co-PIs are to continue and expand this premier Graduate Program, and support the highest quality
students in their truly interdisciplinary training which blends biomedicine, computer science and engineering. The
Program will continue to evolve the curriculum (including online offerings) and develop and offer electives that
will prepare students for the challenges of big data and computational biomedical research. The program will
continue its mode of training that begins with a set of research rotations in laboratories of faculty members, and

Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects up to 5% of couples, yet nearly half of cases remain unexplained by
current testing recommendations. Euploid pregnancy loss, in the setting of unexplained RPL, is particularly
frustrating for patients and providers because there is no clear explanation or any proven therapies to mitigate
risk of subsequent miscarriages. As clinical presentation and subsequent pregnancy outcomes vary widely, this
complex disorder will ultimately require a precision health approach. While more than 3000 human genes are
conserved and likely essential for early development, remarkably little is known about their contribution to RPL
and current genetic databases are essentially devoid of RPL entries. Moreover, there is currently no database
that annotates phenotypes and genotypes of these essential genes. This proposal aims to define genetic
determinants of RPL through clinical and molecular phenotyping and genomic sequencing of a large RPL cohort,
combined with novel bioinformatics and machine learning approaches to derive predictive risk algorithms. A
comprehensive approach to identify genomic markers of pregnancy loss by whole genome sequencing of well-
characterized RPL trios (mother-father-pregnancy loss) will be undertaken in Aim 1. These genetics efforts will
be paired in Aim 2 with metabolomic, lipidomic and single cell transcriptomic profiling preconception and in early
pregnancy. Leveraged with innovative machine learning strategies in Aim 3, this approach will significantly
advance understanding of the genetic underpinnings of unexplained RPL. A clinical ‘intolerome’ database will
be constructed in Aim 4 to facilitate worldwide collaboration and curation of genotypes and associated
phenotypes, making the genetics and omics data and results available to the public as well as other funded
teams. This multidisciplinary team includes leaders in RPL, genetics, genomics, prenatal diagnosis,
bioinformatics and machine learning at Stanford, UCSF and OHSU. Combined we have a substantial cohort of
RPL patients that will serve as a robust recruitment source, along with a collaboration with the unique UK
Pregnancy Baby BioBank of existing trios to accomplish project goals. The proposed study is anticipated to have
significant clinical and research impact by identifying the genomic contribution to RPL in a large and well
phenotyped cohort and building improved risk predictions based on machine learning incorporating clinical,
genetic, and molecular data. This work will lay the foundation for precision medicine-based interventions for RPL
couples who are difficult to diagnose and have few proven treatments."

Transcription factors are key determinants of gene expression. Lipophilic hormonal ligands and accompanying
co-regulatory molecules trigger the activity of transcription factors, including members of the nuclear hormone
receptor (NR) family. AR and its splice variant AR-V7 are NRs that play key roles in prostate cancer development,
and particularly CRPC. Current therapies targeting AR mainly focus on its ligand-binding domain (LBD), which
is not present in AR-V7. Patients that respond initially to those therapies become resistant to them within a few
years. Both AR and AR-V7 must recruit CoRs to be functionally active. Disruption of the AR–CoR interface
inhibits AR activity in both androgen-dependent cells and CRPC cells. Therefore, knowledge of how AR variants
interact with specific CoRs to form a transcriptionally active complex is critical for the design of therapeutics
targeting AR and AR-V7. Our preliminary studies provided the first structural understanding of active NR–CoR
complex assembly and demonstrated that conformational variability has a profound impact on NR-mediated
transcriptional activation.
In this proposal, we hypothesize that AR and its variants have a common set of CoRs, but that the assembly and
three-dimensional arrangement of those CoRs in AR complexes are unique to each and contribute to the
regulation of transcriptional activities. We propose to leverage the complementary expertise of investigators in
NR biology, cryoEM, and image processing to determine the structural basis of transcriptionally active AR
complexes. We will pursue that goal through two specific aims: 1) Solve a high-resolution DNA–AR structure to
identify domain-domain interactions in detail and then compare it to the structure of DNA–AR-V7; and 2) Improve
the resolution of AR–CoR complexes structures to identify detailed interactions and determine the structural
differences in comparison with AR-V7–CoR complexes. Both aims will utilize cryoEM to visualize functional AR–
CoR complexes. The proposed work is significant because the structures will describe the overall interactions in
the system to determine which components should be targeted for therapeutic modulation. A structural
understanding of how AR forms functional dimers and interacts with CoRs to activates gene expression will
provide critical information about the biology of transcription and enable future studies of looking for small-
molecular inhibitors can affect the AR complex arrangement. The proposed multidisciplinary work is innovative
because it employs advanced imaging techniques to achieve unprecedented insights into the structure and
function of AR–CoR complexes, AR heterodimers, and the drugs that target them."

Globally, approximately 1.4 million pregnancies are impacted by HIV every year. In Eastern and Southern
Africa, nearly a third of women living with HIV initiating ART during pregnancy become lost to follow-up (LTFU)
and 29-42% do not maintain viral suppression in the postpartum period. Differentiated service delivery (DSD) is
an evidence-based implementation strategy endorsed by the World Health Organization to improve retention
and viral suppression for people living with HIV. DSD simplifies and adapts HIV services to meet the needs
and preferences of clinically stable clients, allowing for intensification of service delivery to unstable clients who
are most in need. However, DSD models for prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) are
lacking and data to guide the adaptation of DSD to PMTCT are scarce. The objective of this K23 research is to
adapt, execute and evaluate a DSD model for PMTCT to enhance retention and viral suppression for this
population. The central hypothesis is that retention and viral suppression are driven by a complex interplay of
individual and contextual factors that affect women differently and shape their preferences for services.
PMTCT programs in resource-limited settings can improve outcomes by tailoring service delivery to more
accurately and efficiently meet clients’ needs and preferences using a DSD approach. The specific aims are:
(1) Determine patient preferences for PMTCT services through a discrete choice experiment with pregnant and
postpartum women living with HIV who are retained in care or LTFU, and use these data to identify
components for the DSD model; (2) Develop a DSD model for PMTCT and build organizational readiness for
implementation, using a human-centered design approach that incorporates stakeholders’ perspectives; (3)
Execute a DSD model for PMTCT at one maternal and child health clinic in a resource-limited setting, and
evaluate the model’s implementation using the RE-AIM/PRISM framework. This research will take place at the
Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) in Kenya and utilize the research infrastructure of
the East Africa International Epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (EA-IeDEA) Consortium. In addition to
developing new knowledge, this K23 award will support the career development and training of the PI, Dr. John
Humphrey, so that he can achieve his career goal. His career goal is to become an independent investigator
with expertise in implementation strategies to improve HIV outcomes in resource-limited settings, with a
specific focus on PMTCT. His training aims are: (1) Designing optimized implementation strategies using
discrete choice methodology and integrating data generated through multi-methods research; (2) Executing
and evaluating implementation strategies using implementation frameworks. This K23 will yield an evidence-
based DSD model for PMTCT, filling a major gap in the guidelines and literature for this population. This K23
will also position Dr. Humphrey to develop an R01 to conduct a large-scale trial of a DSD model for PMTCT in
the EA-IeDEA network as an independent investigator."

An Academic-Industrial partnership between scientists and clinicians at the University of Texas Southwestern
(UTSW) Medical Center and Philips Research Hamburg and Philips North America (Philips) has been formed
with the purpose of translating the novel molecular MR imaging method, Chemical Exchange Saturation
Transfer (CEST), into a clinical tool for the assessment of Small Renal Masses (SRMs). CEST has already
demonstrated feasibility in neurooncology applications. The management of SRMs is challenging because a
substantial number of them are benign or indolent malignant tumors, leading to patient exposure to
unnecessary morbidity from biopsies and surgery. Non-invasive distinction between benign/indolent tumors
and aggressive tumors would allow for better risk stratification and patient management. While novel, CEST
has already been adopted by certain clinical centers for assessment in neuro oncology. Recently, our group
demonstrated the promise of CEST to the characterization of breast lesions. Here, we propose to broaden the
application of CEST to renal oncology by addressing the inherent challenges of application of CEST in the
abdomen and by optimizing CEST in patients with SRMs.
 Our hypothesis is that technical development of CEST-MRI allows observation of aggressive tumor
microenvironment in SRM. Our goal is to advance CEST methodology to become a part of comprehensive SRM
evaluation protocol. The goals of the project will be achieved via the following Specific Aims:
 Aim 1: To develop and optimize CEST methodology for SRMs on 3T human MRI system.
 This is technical development Aim, where we will evaluate several approaches addressing major issues
associated with translation of CEST to kidney oncology applications: (i) improved resolution and fat separation,
(ii) acceleration of acquisition using pseudo-cartesian and undersampled algorithms,(iii) motion correction and
(iv) advanced Z-spectrum analysis methods.
 Aim 2: To evaluate the optimized CEST-MRI as a predictive biomarker of SRM hystology.
 The Aim's focus in on the translation of the CEST technology to SRM patients: (i) evaluation of the optimized
in a group of SRM patients: (ii) correlation of the CEST-MRI measurements with histopathology results and
correlation of CEST-MRI with glycogen deposition."

Candidate: Asmin Tulpule, MD, PhD, is a pediatric oncologist and physician-scientist whose long-term goal is
to lead an independent laboratory-based research program studying the basic biology and therapeutic
targeting of fusion oncoproteins in cancer. His recent first-author paper in Cell, as well as contributing
authorship on publications in Nature Medicine, Nature Genetics, Cell Reports and first-author papers from his
graduate work in Cell Stem Cell and Blood, demonstrate his potential as a cancer researcher. This K08
application is crucial for his ongoing career development by providing him with key mentorship and training in
1) Mouse modeling of human cancer and pre-clinical drug testing, 2) Microscopy techniques to study
Biomolecular Condensates, and 3) Training in RTK and RAS/RAF biology.
Research: Resistance to standard of care tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is inevitable for the majority of
patients with RTK fusion-driven lung and other advanced cancers and remains the major cause of mortality.
Dr. Tulpule recently found that multiple RTK fusion oncoproteins self-assemble into membraneless cytoplasmic
RTK protein granules that locally coordinate RAS activation and are critical for oncogenesis. The goal of this
proposal is to develop mechanistically informed therapeutics that target the unique oncogenic signaling
properties of this cancer-specific biomolecular condensate. The following specific aims are proposed: 1) To
test SHP2 inhibitors in xenograft models as a new RTK protein granule-directed therapeutic strategy, and 2) To
determine how membraneless RTK protein granules activate RAF kinases.
Mentorship and Training: Dr. Tulpule’s training will be accomplished through direct teaching of laboratory
techniques, formal coursework, academic conferences, and frequent meetings with his Advisory Committee.
Asmin's primary mentor is Trever Bivona, MD, PhD, a thoracic oncologist with expertise in molecularly targeted
therapies and RAS biology. Dr. Bivona has mentored four post-doctoral fellows to independence within the
past five years and has extensive research support from the NIH (4 NCI-funded R01’s). Dr. Tulpule has
assembled a tremendous team of physician-scientists for his Advisory Committee including co-mentor
Alejandro Sweet-Cordero, MD (pediatric oncologist and expert in xenograft modeling), Bo Huang, PhD (expert
in high-resolution imaging techniques), Kevin Shannon, MD (expert in RAS biology and mouse models), and
William Weiss, MD, PhD (expert in cancer signaling). This Advisory committee has a significant track-record of
mentoring trainees to independence and will provide the necessary scientific and mentoring support.
Environment. Dr. Tulpule's training and research will occur at University of California, San Francisco, a world-
renowned center of biomedical research with almost $700 million in support from the NIH (ranking 3rd among
all institutions). He has the full support of the Division of Pediatric Oncology and the UCSF Cancer Center,
both of which have a long-track record of supporting physician-scientist investigators."
10793337,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Suicide is a leading contributor to global mortality and rates have remained steady, or increased, in low-
resourced settings. South Asia has the highest suicide rate in the world and despite different cultural risk profiles
for suicide, little research has explored strategies for health systems to address its growing suicide burden. Given
rising suicide rates and growing dissemination of mental health training programs for primary care health workers
to treat common mental disorders (the WHO mental health gap action programme, mhGAP), there is critical and
urgent need to incorporate implementation strategies for suicide detection, management and follow up within
these programs. Community health workers remain an untapped resource to provide suicide prevention support
in settings where it is needed most, particularly within overburdened health facilities. Using co-design principals
and RE-AIM with primary health workers and a community advisory board, this project will assess barriers to
implementing mhGAP suicide modules, then adapt and pilot test a package of strategies to optimize
implementation within a decentralized primary care system in Nepal. We anticipate the primary care suicide
prevention package (P-SuPP) will include more systematized screening with decision tool aids, the systematic
integration of CHW task-shifted safety planning and contact follow-up, supportive supervision, and enhanced
digital monitoring systems. The proposed research will in Aim 1 conduct a formative evaluation of current mhGAP
suicide practices among clinicians and then co-develop and refine implementation protocols (including
workflows, health worker training, and support standards) for integrating suicide detection and follow-up
management (P-SuPP) to meet the needs of primary health providers. Aim 2 will complete a pilot feasibility
hybrid type 2 randomized controlled trial (RCT) of P-SuPP versus standard mhGAP. We will use mixed-methods
to assess trial feasibility and acceptability of implementing and sustaining P-SuPP. We will explore patient-level
preliminary effectiveness outcomes including suicidality, depression, and uptake of follow-up care. We will also
explore preliminary pilot RCT implementation outcomes including Reach, Adoption, Implementation, and
Maintenance of P-SuPP at 6 months for a future fully powered trial. This R34 lays the groundwork for a future
R01 to scale a package for suicide prevention strategies that can be integrated into government primary care
facilities, particularly targeting individuals living in low-resourced settings. As the model is designed to be easily
adapted and integrated, we anticipate the findings will be valuable for all researchers looking to improve
population health and mental health services in disadvantaged settings."

Dysfunction of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) is responsible for several forms of catastrophic
childhood encephalopathies. Over 1000 loss-of-function mutations in the VGSC SCN1A have been identified
during the last two decades and are the main cause of Dravet syndrome (DS), characterized by recurrent early-
life febrile seizures (FSs), severe afebrile epilepsy, cognitive and behavioral deficits, and a 15-20% mortality
rate. Mutations in the VGSC SCN8A were more recently identified in 2012, and already over 200 gain-of-function
SCN8A mutations have been reported in patients with a range of clinical features including catastrophic
treatment-resistant childhood epilepsy, autism, intellectual disability and developmental delay. Unfortunately,
most anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) fail to adequately treat the broad range of severe seizures and behavioral
phenotypes in patients with SCN1A- and SCN8A-derived epilepsy. Thus, despite recent progress in
pharmacological treatments for DS, there remains a need to develop more effective, longer lasting treatments
with fewer side effects. Neuropeptides are well known in animal studies to show great promise for controlling
seizures and ameliorating behavioral abnormalities; however, they do not readily cross the blood brain barrier
and are rapidly metabolized when given systemically. Thus, poor brain penetrance is a critical barrier to the
clinical application of these promising therapeutics. To overcome this challenge, we developed and validated an
approach based on the encapsulation of neuropeptides in nanoparticles conjugated to rabies virus glycoprotein
(RVG). Using this approach, we have found that intranasal delivery of nanoparticle-encapsulated oxytocin (NP-
OT) greatly increases brain penetrance and the capacity of OT to confer robust and sustained increases in
resistance to seizures in mouse models of SCN1A and SCN8A dysfunction. We have also extended our strategy
to encapsulate neuropeptide Y (NP-NPY), and similarly observed a robust improvement in its ability to confer
seizure resistance. In the proposed study, we will establish the ability of NP-OT and NP-NPY to ameliorate
spontaneous seizures and behavioral abnormalities in Scn1a and Scn8a mouse mutants (Aim 1). While the role
of OT in social behavior is well-studied, less is known about the mechanisms by which it modulates seizure
susceptibility. Thus, we will also identify the cellular and neural circuit mechanisms that contribute to the ability
of OT to increase seizure resistance in the Scn1a and Scn8a mutants (Aim 2). Our long-term goal is to develop
safe and effective approaches for the brain delivery of neuropeptides for the treatment of epilepsy and other
neurological disorders."

Schizophrenia is a multifaceted neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by positive, cognitive, and negative
symptom categories. One particular negative symptom, amotivation, generates a major impact on public health,
yet the treatment options for this symptom remain sparse. This proposal seeks to investigate a novel circuit
underlying the amotivation phenotype in a mouse model of 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), one of the
most robust genetic contributors to schizophrenia. Data derived from this study stand to provide novel treatment
options aimed at rectifying amotivation. Despite being implicated in motivational states, the dorsal striatum is
largely overlooked when studying motivated behavior. Moreover, disruptions in thalamic nuclei are involved in
all facets of schizophrenia symptomology, but the role of the thalamus in amotivation remains unknown. My
preliminary results demonstrate amotivation in 22q11DS mice, as well as a deficit in synaptic transmission in the
thalamostriatal pathway. Information flow through this circuit is modulated by intra-striatal cholinergic
interneurons. In 22q11DS mice, I find that there is an increase in the number of spontaneously active cholinergic
interneurons and that blocking cholinergic transmission rescues the thalamostriatal synaptic deficit. These
findings are the first to implicate the thalamostriatal circuit and cholinergic signaling in motivated behaviors. To
study this further, I propose to use cutting-edge approaches in three aims of investigation: 1) to determine the
role of striatal cholinergic interneuron activity in amotivation, 2) to elucidate the cholinergic mechanism underlying
weakened thalamostriatal synaptic transmission, and 3) to identify the contribution of distinct striatal microcircuits
in amotivation. The results of this study stand to significantly enhance our understanding of the neural circuits
underlying motivated behaviors and provide important insight into the disruption of motivation that occurs in
neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and addiction."

This innovative project will replicate the successful Health Sciences & Technology Academy from West
Virginia, with important adaptations for our purposes, in rural Alabama (AL). This adaption will be called Health
Sciences & Technology Academy-Alabama (HSTA-AL). The long-term goal of this project is to build a more
diverse nursing, nurse faculty, nurse scientist and other biomedical professions workforce from among rural,
underserved, primarily African American, economically disadvantaged high school students in AL who will
become the first in their families to graduate from college. This goal will be accomplished by implementing the
HSTA-AL program to provide professional development to teachers designed to help teachers build science
content and pedagogical skills. Teachers will then guide students toward STEM fields by helping them learn to
conduct citizen science. These teachers can also transfer their learned skills for use in teaching other high
school students. To teach research skills to teachers and students, we will focus on conditions including
obesity and related cardiovascular conditions, risk behaviors, and opioid use that disproportionately affect
underserved AL communities. It is anticipated that through HSTA-AL activities, health literacy will be built
among the students and community members in these rural counties. The specific aims for this project are to 1.
Establish community led leadership teams comprised of 100% community members in each rural county
partner, and a joint leadership team for the state comprised of at least 51% community members to promote
community ownership of the HSTA-AL program. 2. Provide annual professional development for 5 teachers
and 5 preservice teachers per year across targeted communities for the purpose of promoting science and
research skills for HSTA-AL and other students to increase the pipeline of high school graduates from rural
areas into university STEM education, some of whom will choose nursing. 3. Provide summer camps annually
for 50 students to promote interest and skills needed for engagement in citizen science addressing issues
related to health disparities in rural AL and to promote exposure to the university environment, near-peer
mentors, STEM education, nurses, nursing education opportunities, advanced nursing degrees, nursing
science, and other biomedical professions. 4. Provide a club experience led by teachers for 95 high school
students across 5 years for the purpose of exposing students to STEM fields in general, nursing, and nursing
science by engaging students in community-based participatory research /citizen science addressing issues
related to health disparities in their communities. 5. Compare the outcomes of HSTA-AL to HSTA for
psychometric measures known to predict workforce development in biomedical fields to determine if replication
of the HSTA program in a rural, primarily African American, economically disadvantaged population is feasible
and effective. If HSTA-AL achieves similar outcomes to HSTA in West Virginia, we plan to expand this program
across AL and seek funding to support HSTA-AL students’ college and graduate school education."

More than 9 million Americans are incarcerated in jail each year. Of these individuals, 60% are racial/ethnic
minorities and are from socioeconomic disadvantaged populations. Among individuals incarcerated in a rural,
county jail, there are high rates of anxiety, hypertension, and poor sleep quality while incarcerated. Physical
activity (PA) can mitigate these outcomes and be immediate. A single bout of moderate-to-vigorous PA improves
anxiety symptoms, decreases blood pressure, and improves sleep on the day it is performed. Despite these
benefits, over 75% of individuals incarcerated in jail do not attend recreation time (rec-time), a structured time
dedicated for PA. Of those who attended rec-time, over half were sedentary and no interventions have been
conducted in the jail setting to promote PA. The scientific objective of the proposed research is to develop and
test the feasibility and preliminary impact of a robust physical activity program among individuals while
incarcerated in jail. We hypothesize that individuals residing in housing units assigned to the intervention arm
will have higher rec-time attendance, PA levels, self-efficacy, expectations and values of PA, perceived behavior
of others, sleep quality, as well as lower stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms as compared to individuals
residing in housing units assigned to the control arm. We will identify essential theoretical constructs of Social
Cognitive Theory (SCT, i.e., self-efficacy, social support, self-regulation, behavioral capability, outcome
expectations, environment), as well as behavioral and cultural attributes of PA among individuals incarcerated
to enhance the cultural relevance and effectiveness of a PA program through focus groups and key informant
interviews. From formative research, input from jail administration on feasibility of implementation, and
involvement from individuals incarcerated on acceptability, we will develop a robust PA program to promote rec-
time attendance and increase PA among individuals incarcerated. Once developed, we will determine feasibility
preliminary impact of a PA program using a two-armed clustered randomized control trial to randomize 18
housing units to either an intervention or control arm. Study outcomes include rec-time attendance, PA levels at
rec-time, self-efficacy, expectations and values of PA, perceived behavior of others, sleep quality, stress, anxiety,
and depression. The potential individual gains from even one bout of PA are substantial. Providing individuals
opportunities to attend and be physically active during rec-time may improve health conditions in correctional
institutions. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in
epidemiology that includes new training in (1) qualitative and mixed methods, (2) intervention development,
implementation, and evaluation, and (3) clinical trials. The combined research and training plans will prepare the
applicant for a successful, independent research career focused on identifying approaches to promote PA and
reduce related health disparities among incarcerated populations."

 The management of chronic pain is clinically challenging, and relies heavily on opioid drugs like morphine
and oxycodone. However, opioids are plagued by numerous side effects that impact quality of life, like tolerance,
constipation, and reward/addiction, contributing to an opioid abuse, addiction, and overdose crisis. These clinical
and social challenges highlight the vast medical need for new approaches to pain management. To this end, we
have pioneered an investigation into the role of Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in regulating opioid signal
transduction, anti-nociception, and side effects. We have found that Hsp90 regulates mu opioid receptor (MOR)
signal transduction to different effect in brain vs. spinal cord. In brain, Hsp90 promotes MOR signaling and anti-
nociception, so that Hsp90 inhibition in brain blocks opioid anti-nociception. In spinal cord, Hsp90 blocks MOR
signaling and anti-nociception, so that Hsp90 inhibition in spinal cord enhances opioid anti-nociception. In further
studies, we found that Hsp90 inhibition in spinal cord increases morphine anti-nociceptive potency 2-3 fold
in acute and chronic pain, reduces tolerance and rescues established tolerance, all without altering the
potency of constipation and reward. These results suggest that spinal Hsp90 inhibition could be used as an
opioid dose-reduction strategy, to improve or maintain analgesic efficacy while reducing side effects. However,
one challenge to this approach is our finding that non-selective Hsp90 inhibitors, when given systemically, gave
results similar to the brain, blocking opioid anti-nociception. Seeking a way around this limitation, we found that
Hsp90 isoforms differ between brain and spinal cord, with Hsp90α alone acting in brain while Hsp90α, Hsp90β,
and Grp94 all act in spinal cord. Hypothesizing that an isoform-selective Hsp90 inhibitor could be used to target
spinal cord-specific isoforms, we found that the Hsp90β-selective inhibitor KUNB106 enhanced morphine anti-
nociception while rescuing established morphine tolerance when given systemically. These results strongly
suggest that Hsp90β-selective inhibitors could be used as a novel, first-in-class opioid dose-reduction therapy.
However, KUNB106 is a first generation compound, with poor solubility and pharmacokinetics (PK) and an
uncertain therapeutic profile. In this proposal, we will thus optimize KUNB106 to create a new therapeutic to
enhance opioid therapy and reduce opioid side effects like reward/addiction. In Aim 1 we will utilize cutting edge
medicinal chemistry approaches using Hsp90 isoform co-crystallized structures to create optimized compounds
based on the KUNB106 scaffold. In Aim 2, we will test these compounds for Hsp90 isoform selectivity, ADMET
parameters, off-target interactions, and in vivo PK in mice, aiming to identify highly selective, soluble, and orally
bioavailable compounds. In Aim 3, we will test the best of these compounds for their efficacy in enhancing opioid
anti-nociception in acute and chronic pain models in mice, while reducing tolerance, constipation, reward, and
respiratory depression. Top candidates will be tested for off-target side effects and toxicity. Through this project,
we aim to create optimized candidates for further development as new therapeutics for patient pain management."
10831442,"Project Summary. Community-dwelling persons living with dementia (PLWD) are highly susceptible to avoida-
ble emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. Adult day service centers (ADCs) provide commu-
nity-based care to a growing number of racially diverse PLWD, the majority of whom are low-income. Daily as-
sessment and serial observations by an ADC’s interdisciplinary staff (which includes registered nurses, social
workers, and program directors) support early detection of clinical problems in PLWD. However, when acute
changes in health status occur, ADC staff who wish to provide timely notification to primary care providers
(PCPs) frequently cannot do so effectively. In my prior research, I found that ADC staff relied on facsimile or
voicemail message to communicate urgent information. This resulted in delayed or non-responses from PCPs
and allowed minor health issues to escalate into medical emergencies. As the number of PLWD in ADCs
grows, there is a critical need to strengthen communication of salient clinical information between ADCs,
PCPs, and caregivers to reduce costly hospitalizations and ED visits. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions
have been shown to improve communication and clinical information exchange across a variety of health care
settings, but they have not been designed for ADCs. My goal in seeking a K23 award is to become an inde-
pendent scientist who leads a research program that integrates care from ADCs and PCPs using mHealth in-
terventions to reduce avoidable health care utilization disparities in PLWD. With support from an experienced
interdisciplinary mentorship team, I will acquire training in three areas: using integrated health systems to ad-
dress health care utilization disparities, developing mHealth interventions using user-centered design princi-
ples, and designing and testing behavioral interventions. With the requisite training, I will execute the following
specific aims: (1) identify the key domains of an mHealth application intended to support communication be-
tween ADCs, PCPs, and informal caregivers regarding the health-related needs of PLWD; (2) design and test
the visual layout of an mHealth application intended to support communication between ADCs, PCPs, and in-
formal caregivers of PLWD; and (3) develop and examine the feasibility and acceptability of mHealth applica-
tion use among ADC staff, PCPs, and informal caregivers in reducing hospitalizations and ED visits in PLWD
over a 6-month period. My findings will inform a future R01 proposal to test the efficacy of an intervention using
a fully operational mHealth application. This study is significant because the findings will be used to improve
standards of care and reduce costly and traumatic outcomes in PLWD. It also advances legislation from the
Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology requiring that patients be able to access
information from their medical records using their preferred smartphone application. This study is innovative
because it leverages ADCs’ strengths and incorporates frontline provider perspectives to inform the develop-
ment of a pragmatic user-centered mHealth application to integrate care and reduce disparities in PLWD."

The lifetime risk for acquiring colorectal cancer (CRC) is 7%, with an astounding rate of disease recurrence in
32% of newly diagnosed patients after their “successful” treatment. Patient with recurrent disease have a dismal
14.3% five-year survival. Lack of effective biomarkers hampers early detection of pre-metastatic disease,
impacting overall survival from CRC. We identified a promising disseminated tumor cell—a product of
macrophage (MФ) and cancer cell fusion—that harbors genotypic and phenotypic features of both cells of origin.
Detectable along the metastatic cascade, hybrid cells can initiate tumor growth, migrate in response to MФ
receptor-ligand chemotaxis, and seed metastatic sites. In peripheral blood, hybrids, named circulating hybrid
cells (CHCs) outnumber conventionally defined circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in CRC patients, overcoming the
sensitivity of CTC—a primary barrier—to usage as a biomarker for disease. CHCs are phenotypically diverse
and reflect protein expression of the primary tumor. Based on these exciting findings, we propose that hybrid
cells subpopulations harbor discrete phenotypes of pre-metastatic cells that can be identified and defined using
single cell image-based phenotyping through multiplexed imaging and multimodal integration with –omics. To
this end, we will analyze CHCs derived from early stage and metastatic tumors for image-based phenotyping
with single cell gene expression. Utilizing quantitative and advanced image analytics including deep learning
approach for image-based cell profiling, we will define inter/subcellular spatial features in single cells to identify
new subpopulations and differentiate discrete phenotypic populations associated with metastatic signatures. In
addition, the application of both imaging and genomic technologies to the same specimen independently
measures highly dimensional, yet non-orthogonal, sets of cellular features. Multimodal integration of imaging
and single cell data will quantify systems-level biological functions of cellular subpopulation and enhance imaging
biomarker panel to gain biomarker specificity and sensitivity for validation in a discrete CRC patient cohort. Our
overall goal is to develop a novel tumor biomarker, based upon CHC phenotyping and –omics analyses that can
be used to provide new quantitative insights and develop machine-driven prediction with superior accuracy for
identifying risk of metastases in CRC patients to ultimately impact survival."

Heavy drinking in young adults (YA) is prevalent, and associated with serious negative consequences
including mortality and risk for alcohol use disorders (AUD) 1-7. However, existing interventions have shown
modest efficacy 8-14, and innovative interventions are needed. YA interventions have potential for broad
impact if they are brief, computerized (especially web-based), and target core neurocognitive
mechanisms underlying heavy drinking 14,15. Two such mechanisms are craving and regulation of craving.
Defined in DSM-5 as “a strong desire” 16, craving is prospectively associated with and predicts drinking (e.g.,17-
25, including in YAs (e.g., 26-29). Importantly, alcohol-associated cues increase craving 30; such cue-induced
craving is also prospectively associated with and predicts drinking(e.g.,31-35), including in YA 32,33,36,37. These
data implicate cue-induced craving as a core mechanism underlying drinking 38. Consistently, skills
training in regulation of craving is an important feature of many interventions 39-44, including cognitive-behavioral
therapy (CBT) 45 and mindfulness-based treatments (MBT) 46,47. Further, regulation of craving directly relates to
reductions in craving and drinking, and better treatment outcomes(e.g., 34,41,42,48-52), including in YA 53. These
data implicate regulation of craving as a core mechanism underlying change in drinking/abstinence 54.
We developed the Regulation of Craving (ROC) task to investigate cognitive, affective, and neural mechanisms
associated with craving and its regulation across substances 55-61. In one study, alcohol drinkers were exposed
to alcohol images60. On craving trials, they experienced cue-induced craving and exhibited neural activity in
regions including ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex 62-64. On regulation trials they used a
treatment-based strategy to modulate their craving. We found that self-reported craving and craving-related
neural activity were significantly reduced during regulation 60. However, across studies we found that the
neural mechanisms by which regulation operates depend on the strategy used. Specifically, regulation
with CBT strategies (e.g., ‘think of the negative consequences of drinking’) depends on the PFC 56,60,65 while
regulation with MBT strategies (e.g., ‘notice and accept craving without judgment’) does not 57,66,67.
Based on this, we developed two brief, web-based, mechanism-focused interventions: CBT-based and
MBT-based Regulation of Craving Training (ROC-T) 58,68,69, in which participants repeatedly practice
regulating craving in the presence of alcohol images. We propose to evaluate the efficacy of ROC-T and its
mechanisms by randomizing 177 YA heavy drinkers to 4x45 minute sessions of (1) CBT-ROC-T, (2) MBT-
ROC-T, or (3) CONTROL (no strategy). Alcohol use will be measured via Timeline Followback 70 for 10 weeks
as well as a wearable transdermal sensor 71,72. Pre- and post-training, we will evaluate cognitive, affective, and
neural mechanisms underlying ROC-T using the ROC task and fMRI. The current project has the potential to
significantly advance mechanism-targeted interventions for heavy drinking, AUD, and other addictive disorders."

The goal of this proposal is to dissect the underlying mechanism of the Tao and TAOK
subfamily of Ste20 kinases in mediating mechanosensing and tissue growth in both Drosophila
and mouse intestines. Billions of cells in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract epithelium are
shed and replaced every day. This fast pace of cell replacement also allows the intestine to
afford adaptive growth, during which the epithelium can expand or shrink rapidly according to
the need. Mechanistic study of tissue homeostasis in the human GI tract epithelium is, however,
rather difficult because of the complexity of cell types, pathways and microbes involved. The
Drosophila midgut has a similar but yet simpler anatomy and physiology than mammalian
intestines. With highly cell-specific markers and sophisticated genetic techniques available, as
well as a short life cycle to allow multiple generations of in vivo experiments, the Drosophila
midgut has become a highly valuable system to study complex intestinal biology. We have
recently discovered a novel function of the Drosophila Ste20 kinase Misshapen that mediates
food particle ingestion caused mechanical stretching signal to regulate growth. Another Ste20
kinase Tao functions upstream, and may link the membrane mechanosensing components to
Misshapen and downstream growth signaling. This pathway is well-conserved in mammals, with
homologs of Misshapen (MINK1, MAP4K4, and TNIK), as well as other Ste20 kinases including
Hippo (MST1 andMST2), can similarly interact with the downstream components LATS and
YAP. The functional analysis of these mammalian homologs, however, post a strong barrier due
to the high level of overlapping functions. Therefore, the complementary study of Tao in
Drosophila midgut and TAOK1/2 in mouse intestine will provide a better understanding of how
this conserved pathway mediate mechanosensing to affect intestinal tissue growth. This model
has physiological relevance, because human patients recovering from bowel resection, bariatric
surgery or radiation therapy have better intestinal growth after solid food intake. Meanwhile,
total parenteral nutrition, that is through intravenous supply only, causes intestinal mucosal
atrophy. Therefore, interaction between solid food and intestinal epithelium is beneficial, but the
mechanism is not well-understood. The genetic studies in Drosophila midgut and in mouse
intestine, followed by molecular and protein-protein interaction analyses will unveil their
sequence of action of this Tao pathway in transducing mechanical signals for adaptive growth
and should provide important insights into similar processes in human intestines."

The goal of the Summer Medical Research Internship (SMRI) is to exploit the rich research community at
the University of Virginia (UVA) to expose medical students to the excitement, capabilities, rigors, and
breadth of opportunities for careers in allergy and infectious diseases research. From its inception, the
major goals of this NIAID-supported program have been to: (1) provide a high-quality, immersive, hands-
on research experience in allergy or infectious diseases, igniting the passion of the next generation of
physician-scientists; (2) introduce trainees to the rich synergy between basic research and clinical care;
(3) instruct trainees on how to communicate about scientific discovery to audiences with different
backgrounds and levels of expertise; and 4) inform trainees about different approaches through which
research can be successfully incorporated into a career in clinical medicine, with an overarching goal of
kindling and nurturing a passion for doing research that truly makes a difference and leaves a mark on
mankind. This application seeks support to continue this successful program, through which ten (10)
medical students will be supported each year. The ten-week program has three educational components.
The first and most important is an immersive, hand-on research experience mentored by of one of our 52
program faculty and focused in the mission areas of the NIAID. Second, the trainees participate in a
weekly 1-hour workshop focused on developing and refining written and oral scientific communication
skills appropriate for various contexts and audiences. Finally, the trainees attend a weekly professional
development luncheon series. One part of this series, titled “Conversations with a Physician-Scientist,”
features faculty who have each taken a different approach to incorporating research into their career in
clinical medicine. The second part is a seminar series which features highly successful researchers from
across the UVA community, who present their research and discuss their career path. Through strong
mentorship, hands-on research, innovative educational initiatives, and exposure to a wide range of
perspectives on combining research and clinical interests, trainees in the SMRI are uniquely prepared to
pursue advanced training with the ultimate goal of becoming members of the physician-scientist workforce.

10825439,"Project Summary
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critically important for pediatric care. However, patient motion
significantly limits our ability to produce high-quality images in young children who may be unable to respond
well to verbal instructions and who have difficulty remaining still inside the scanner. Head motion during MRI
disrupts spatial encoding and leads to data loss, generating a range of artifacts in the images, which hinders
diagnostic utility. Thus, sedation and anesthesia are routinely used in pediatric populations; however, these
practices are associated with severe adverse events and are extremely time-consuming and costly to
administer. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art motion compensation technologies are not fast or accurate
enough to adequately compensate for large and frequent head movements in uncooperative children, or
require external hardware, which is far from ideal for clinical workflow. Under the previous grant period, we
made significant progress towards our overarching goal of improved motion-robust pediatric MRI by
successfully developing a new markerless motion tracking approach utilizing free induction decay (FID)
navigators and novel algorithms to generate diagnostic images from small periods of motion-free time. The
goal of the research proposed under this renewed application to the NIH is two-fold: 1) to continue to develop
and refine novel markerless technologies for motion measurement and correction to enable high-quality MRI in
the presence of large, frequent motion and 2) to evaluate these technologies for improving the quality and
success rate of pediatric MRI without the use of sedation and anesthesia. We hypothesize that improving the
accuracy of FID navigator motion measurements, and the extent and speed of our correction algorithms, will
successfully compensate for sources of persistent artifacts in the images. To achieve these ambitious goals,
we propose to undertake the following Specific Aims over the 5-year period of requested support: 1) develop
and evaluate an extended model that can, for the first time, simultaneously measure head motion and induced
magnetic field changes using FID navigators; 2) develop and evaluate a novel self-navigated 3D radial
acquisition with augmented reconstruction for retrospective correction of motion, and induced magnetic field
and coil sensitivity variations; 3) develop and evaluate prospective motion correction and dynamic shimming
utilizing real-time motion and field measurements to produce artifact-free images; and 4) apply and evaluate
these highly innovative motion compensation techniques for imaging 0–8 year old patients without the use of
sedation. The motion-robust imaging technologies proposed in this application can be easily deployed in
clinical settings with widely-available, standard MRI hardware, and are therefore expected to have rapid
translational impact for the countless pediatric diseases and disorders presently evaluated by MRI. The ability
to image young children without the use of sedation and anesthesia will dramatically decrease the time, cost
and risk involved in generating diagnostically useful images with MRI."
10761760,"Effective testing for HIV allows for detection of acute infections (new and rebound), appropriate
antiretroviral treatment, suppression of viral load, and interruption of transmission. However, early
detection of infection or regular self-monitoring at point-of-need or at home remains a challenge. Lateral
flow assays are a well-established, inexpensive point-of-need diagnostic method, and commonly are
favored when applicable because of their ease of use and low cost. Where they most commonly fall
short is in analytical sensitivity, notably in antigen-detection diagnostics for infectious diseases. Our
goal is to develop radically-improved LFAs by implementing the inexpensive, shelf-stable
chemi-excitation chemistry of glow sticks in a point-of-care format to excite fluors without light or optical
filters. Our preliminary results suggest this chemistry enables LFAs with greatly improved limits of
detection (very low pg/mL), using a standard smartphone with a $2 adaptor and no sophisticated optical
components. Our central hypothesis is that our novel, reagent-optimized chemi-excited lateral flow
assay technology integrated with a storage-stable reagent cartridge and readable with a smartphone
will lead to a new, widely-useful and potentially very-superior class of highly-sensitive lateral flow
assays. We will test this hypothesis through 5 specific aims: (1) Development of a highly-sensitive and
easily-usable lateral flow assay for HIV p24 in human blood, including development of novel
avidity-enhanced dual-fibronectin-domain binders, (2) Immune complex dissociation (ICD) for
rebound/breakthrough HIV diagnosis, (3) Testing with 300 negative and archived-positive human
samples from diverse cohorts, (4) To evaluate clinical performance using fresh samples from patients
and usability with a diverse population of subjects at high risk of HIV infection/rebound (R33 Phase), (5)
Easier usability by more people, quality assurance for test items (R33 Phase)."
10755746,"Project Summary:
The development of a novel therapeutic strategy to effectively target multiple pathological mechanisms of
secondary brain damage after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a top clinical priority. The metabolic
reprogramming of neurovascular inflammatory cells after TBI may contribute to the cellular
oxidative/neuroinflammatory stresses and play critical roles in the early triggering and acceleration of
secondary brain injury cascades. However, the detailed knowledge remains largely unknown. Recent
experimental discoveries demonstrate that itaconate, one of the most abundant tricarboxylic acids (TCA)
cycle intermediates, produced by an enzyme called immune-responsive gene 1 protein (Irg-1), may function
as a signaling transducer in modulating the metabolic reprogramming. Our central hypothesis is that the Irg-
1/itaconate modulates the metabolic reprogramming and thus controls neurovascular inflammatory signaling
pathways of the microglia and the cerebrovascular endothelium by preserving mitochondria oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS), suppressing hyperglycolysis/NFκB activation, and activating nuclear factor E2-
related factor 2 (Nrf2), which results in the inhibition of microglial activation-associated neuroinflammation,
and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity disruption; these actions interactively prevent the secondary brain
damage and ultimately improve the long-term neurological outcome of TBI. Our preliminary data are highly
supportive of our proposed hypotheses and experimental approaches. In this project, we will pursue three
integrated aims using bioenergetics/metabolomics and transcriptomics, functional energy metabolic assay
of brain slices and isolated cells, and in combination with cell-specific transgenic and pharmacological,
molecular pathology, and neurological outcome assessments. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role of
microglial Irg-1/itaconate in the modulation of microglial pro-inflammatory activation after TBI. In Aim 2, we
will investigate the role of cerebrovascular endothelial Irg-1/itaconate in the modulation of BBB integrity after
TBI. In Aim 3, we will investigate the role of itaconate supplementation in long-term neurological outcomes
after TBI in mice. The proposed studies will provide detailed insights into the dynamic
bioenergetics/metabolic reprogramming of inflammatory microglia and cerebral endothelium, elucidate the
role of Irg-1/itaconate in modulating the metabolic reprogramming, and associated neurovascular
inflammatory mechanisms after TBI."

Abstract
Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, significant racial disparities in oral health persist, particularly
between African Americans and other ethnic groups. Increasing diversity in the oral health research and care
workforce is critical to improve the Nation's capacity to address and eliminate oral health disparities.
Howard University is a comprehensive, research-oriented, historically black private university. The student
body has traditionally been predominantly black (currently approximately 67%) and other underserved
minorities. The College of Dentistry is one of the two dental schools at a historically black college or university
in the United States and the only dental school in the Washington, DC, area providing dental health care to
primarily low-income populations. Since 2016, the College and Johns Hopkins University have jointly led a
summer research education experience program (SREEP), funded by the National Institute of Dental and
Craniofacial Research under PAR-13-104. During this time, 45 underrepresented minority undergraduate
students from Howard participated in the program. Thirteen of these students ultimately pursued postgraduate
training in the health science professions (5 in dentistry, 6 in medicine, 1 in a MD/Ph.D. program, and 1 in a
Ph.D. program) after graduating from their undergraduate programs. The PAR-13-104 program was not
renewable; therefore, we seek new funding to support and expand the SREEP.
We propose a SREEP at Howard University to engage, recruit, promote, and train Howard undergraduate
students from underrepresented minorities into oral health and health disparity research. The SREEP will be a
specialized didactic and mentored academic program with a series of formal and informal research and
education activities tailored to recruiting and training undergraduate students. Through the SREEP, we will
provide full-time eight-week-long summer research training for ten highly qualified students every year over the
5-year funding period.
To provide effective mentoring for the students, we will 1) develop a highly networked team of motivated and
skilled mentors from various disciplines by establishing a strong partnership between Howard and Johns
Hopkins Universities; and 2) develop an effective and sustainable research training and education
infrastructure by establishing a three-tiered mentoring system and executive, advising, and evaluation
committees. The three-tiered mentoring system involves matching each participating undergraduate to a
primary mentor with a basic, translational, clinical, community-based, or public health research focus at
Howard, a secondary senior mentor at Hopkins, and a career development mentor.
By participating in multi-disciplinary research projects and education events with experienced investigators who
will serve as mentors and role models, the students will gain valuable research experience and knowledge in
oral health and promote them into advanced education in oral health. Successful completion of this program
will have significantly impacted the dental, oral and craniofacial research and training environment at Howard
University College of Dentistry."
10758525,"Summary
Embryonic development is a series of tightly regulated events that build a single cell into a complex organism. A
key milestone in early embryonic development is gastrulation, when the body plan is first shaped by the behaviors
of thousands of individual cells. However, how these cells communicate to ensure proper morphogenesis is not
completely understood. Mesoderm and neuroectoderm (NE, future neural tube) tissue morphogenesis is driven
by convergence and extension (C&E), when cells intercalate to simultaneously narrow and elongate the body
axis and bring the neural folds together to ensure proper neural tube closure. Disruptions in these highly
conserved cell movements can result in neural tube defects that affect many pregnancies worldwide. Nodal is a
well conserved signaling pathway that is active during gastrulation and most well-known for the role it plays in
mesoderm and endoderm specification in vertebrates. However, little is understood about the role of Nodal in
C&E morphogenesis independent of mesoderm formation, particularly in NE. By utilizing zebrafish ex vivo and
in vivo models, I will study the role of Nodal specifically in morphogenesis independent of its better-known
function during tissue specification. To examine the role of Nodal underlying NE morphogenesis, I can
independently analyze NE extension using ex vivo zebrafish blastoderm explants, naïve clusters of embryonic
cells that form all three germ layers and undergo C&E morphogenesis in response to exogenous Nodal signaling.
An early peak of Nodal signaling in explants promotes mesoderm extension and specification. However,
preliminary data from our lab demonstrated that a relatively delayed peak of Nodal signaling promotes NE-
specific C&E morphogenesis that is independent of its role in mesoderm specification. This suggests that the
temporal regulation of Nodal regulates NE-specific morphogenesis. Based on my promising preliminary data, I
hypothesize that Nodal signaling activates a novel, temporally regulated, NE-specific transcriptional program
that drives C&E morphogenesis independent of mesoderm specification. To test this hypothesis, I propose 3
aims: Aim 1 will investigate the role of temporal Nodal signaling dynamics in NE-specific morphogenesis using
optogenetic Nodal receptors to precisely manipulate signaling in embryonic explants. In Aim 2, I will restore
Nodal signaling specifically within the NE of Nodal-deficient zebrafish embryos using innovative transgenic lines
to determine whether Nodal can drive in vivo NE extension in the absence of mesoderm. Finally, in Aim 3 I will
perform over expression and knock-down of temporally regulated candidate genes to determine if they are
drivers of NE-specific extension both explants and in vivo. This proposal will define the foundational knowledge
on the primary role of Nodal in NE-specific morphogenesis, disruptions in which may contribute to neural tube
defect prevalence and severity."
10923784,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia that is estimated to affect over 40 million people
worldwide. Increases in atrial electrophysiological (action potential duration dispersion, altered conduction
velocity) and structural heterogeneity (fibrosis, scarring) can increase the risk for AF. The cause for AF is
unknown, but a variety of factors such as genetic predisposition, age, cardiovascular co-morbidities,
inflammatory diseases can increase its risk. Ulcerative colitis (UC), a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease,
was recently shown to increase a patient’s risk for AF. UC is an intestinal inflammation within the colon and
rectum of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) that promotes gut dysbiosis. Patients with active colitis have a two-fold
increased risk for AF, and even in remission exhibit changes in atrial excitation and contraction that show atrial
remodeling. Yet, the mechanism with which UC increases the risk for AF remains undetermined and is the focus
of my project. Preliminary data in a mouse model of active colitis show an attenuated vagal tone, increased
sensitivity of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 (M2R) to cholinergic signaling, and prolonged atrial
conduction. These changes are reversible during remission, but in the chronic colitis model are maintained along
with a reduction in the heart/atrial weight, atrial myocyte size and electrophysiological and structural remodeling
of the atria. Based on my pilot data I propose to test the overall hypothesis that UC-induced dysregulation of
vagal nerve activity increases the risk for AF during UC disease progression. To test this hypothesis, I will use a
mouse model of active and chronic colitis. Aim 1 will examine the mechanism by which the risk for atrial
arrhythmic activity is increased during active colitis. In a mouse model of active colitis, I will determine if AF
occurrence is a consequence of a dysregulation in vagal signaling, promoting electrophysiological heterogeneity.
Aim 2 will determine the mechanism by which UC induces an exaggerated response of the heart to cholinergic
signaling. I will examine if a UC-induced attenuated vagal tone promotes an upregulation of atrial cardiomyocyte
M2R expression. Aim 3 will examine the mechanism by which the risk for atrial arrhythmic activity is increased
during chronic colitis. In a mouse model of chronic colitis, I will determine if AF occurrence is a consequence of
an increase in structural heterogeneity. The proposed work will elucidate a mechanism in which AF risk is
increased during UC disease progression. Successful completion of the proposed research would provide an
understanding of the interplay between the heart, GIT and ANS, and allow for a one possible mechanism of AF
to be determined. The findings will lay the groundwork for the creation of a translational treatment for one of the
diseases associated with UC. The research project will be guided by an exceptional team of sponsors that are
well-suited to provide the proper training of the techniques needed to complete the research, mentorship, and to
ensure short-term and long-term success of the trainee. The proposed work will also promote my ability to
execute a scientific project and development as an independent scientist."
10745328,"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Substance Use Disorder (SUD) are highly comorbid, and
comorbidity increases risk for poor functional outcomes. SUDs are associated with poor functional outcomes
such as quality of life, community engagement, and suicide (Teeters, Lancaster, Brown & Back, 2017). Risks
for poor quality of life and suicide increase further for those with co-occurring PTSD and SUD diagnoses as
compared to either condition alone, with suicide attempt rates three times higher for Veterans with alcohol use
disorder and PTSD (Norman, Haller, Hamblen, Southwick & Pietrzak, 2018). For patients with PTSD-SUD,
there is evidence of greater PTSD symptom severity and poorer SUD treatment outcomes (e.g., Back et al.,
2000), as well as higher rates of homelessness and disability (Bowe & Rosenheck, 2015). PTSD-SUD
treatments have shown promising reductions in PTSD and SUD symptoms (Flanagan, Korte, Killeen & Back,
2016). Yet, there are still major challenges in widely implementing concurrent or single-target gold-standard
treatments for this population, especially with rural veterans where care access may be limited (e.g., Flanagan
et al., 2016). Written Exposure Therapy (WET) is a front-line, brief and effective treatment for PTSD that
addresses some of the challenges posed by other gold-standard treatments. This project is designed to
examine the feasibility and acceptability of Written Exposure Therapy (WET) delivered to Veterans with
comorbid PTSD-SUD while they are completing a 28 day-residential SUD program (DOM SUD). The
preliminary effects of the treatment during the program, and at one month and 3 month follow-up periods will
also be examined, with particular attention to rates of substance use, homelessness, treatment attendance,
treatment completion, quality of life, suicidality, and PTSD and depression symptoms. Veterans enrolled in the
DOM SUD with PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5) scores over 33 will be recruited for further screening into the study.
Those that meet criteria for PTSD through confirmation using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-
5 (CAPS-5) will be randomized into one of two treatment arms: Treatment as Usual (DOM SUD) and Written
Exposure Therapy in a residential SUD program (resWET). Randomization will be stratified by gender and
oversampling for women and minority participants will be used. Those in the TAU control group will participate
in the DOM SUD treatment program, while those in the resWET group will also have five individual treatment
sessions of WET. Participants will complete weekly measures of symptoms, in addition to rating cravings for
substance use. Treatment completion rates will also be compiled for both DOM SUD and resWET. Participants
will complete pre-treatment, post-treatment, 1 month, and 3 month follow-up measures in person, over video,
or by phone, and these measures, along with data available from the treatment record, will be examined using
descriptive analyses to look for important trends regarding both symptom responses (e.g., PTSD, depression)
to treatment, as well as behavioral and functional outcomes (such as suicide attempts, homelessness,
treatment attendance, treatment completion, substance use, disability). This preliminary data will be used to
inform future studies using this treatment approach. Additionally, providers in the DOM SUD will complete
treatment feasibility and acceptability measures and focus groups to provide essential information about
implementation barriers that need to be addressed for the uptake of the treatment approach and to enhance
the accessibility of the treatment. All Veterans will also provide feedback about their treatment, through survey
when the treatment is complete, and focus group participation. Findings from both qualitative and quantitative
data will be used to improve the treatment and assessment approach and to determine effect sizes of key
measures (WHO-DAS, PCL, PHQ-9) to prepare for a fully powered RCT to systematically evaluate resWET."
10765677,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic debilitating disease affecting over 1% of Americans. Women are affected
about 3 times more often than men. RA also constitutes a major health problem among the U.S. Veterans. The
Veteran population is aging, and the number of women serving in the military is gradually increasing. In
addition, military personnel in combat zones are exposed to extreme stress and toxic substances in different
forms. All these factors may directly or indirectly influence host immunity and induction/aggravation of RA. The
pain, discomfort, lost working days, and disabilities caused by RA can adversely affect Veterans’ quality of life
in many ways, as well as impose heavy cost of healthcare and rehabilitation. Therefore, studies advancing new
modalities of treatment of RA are highly relevant to the U.S. Veterans. Using the rat adjuvant-induced arthritis
(AA) model of human RA, we developed a peptide-guided targeted liposomal drug delivery system for arthritis
therapy. For this purpose, we used a novel joint-homing peptide ART-2 to guide liposomes entrapping
dexamethasone (DEX) to arthritic joints of rats. Peptide-guided liposomal DEX was more effective in
suppressing arthritis in rats than untargeted liposomal drug or free drug. Importantly, the increased efficacy of
the ART-2 liposomal group was not associated with concurrent increase in systemic toxicity. Thus, peptide-
guided liposomal drug delivery improved the therapeutic profile (benefit/risk ratio) of DEX over the other two
modalities. However, unlike inbred rats (used in the rat AA model), which are genetically homogeneous (same)
and generate immune response mainly to heat-shock protein 65 (Hsp65), RA patients have diverse genetic
make-up and generate immune response to both Hsp65 and type II collagen (CII). Therefore, we need to
validate our current findings from the rat AA model in an independent second model, the mouse collagen-
induced arthritis (CIA) model, which differs in genetics and certain disease parameters from the AA model.
This validation will be the first step to de-risk the translational application of this technology to RA patients
before undertaking further development and evaluation to meet the criteria of an investigational new drug (IND)
for the FDA. This is significant because the Veterans Affairs (VA) has filed a non-provisional patent on the use
of peptide ART-2 for arthritis therapy with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The AA and CIA models of
arthritis share some (but not all) features with human RA, but they also differ in a few critical characteristics:
1) unlike Lewis rats (RT-1l), inbred wild type mice do not develop AA; 2) the predominant target of the T
cells/antibodies is CII in CIA, but Hsp65 in AA; 3) antibodies are pathogenic in CIA, but either show no effect or
are protective in AA; and 4) drug metabolism is different in rats and mice. We will use two CIA models: wild
type DBA/1 (H-2q) mice and “humanized” mice (H-2b) expressing HLA-DR4, one of the disease-susceptibility
genes for RA. [We will test methotrexate (MTX), the gold-standard for RA. We have successfully prepared
liposomes entrapping MTX, and pilot testing in the parent rat arthritis model (AA) showed that MTX
entrapped in liposomes is biologically active and effective in suppressing arthritis. Recently, we have completed
setting-up of the CIA model in our laboratory to validate the above findings from AA model.] The specific
aims of our study in CIA model based on peptide ART-2 and methotrexate (MTX) are: Aim 1: (a) To
validate the preferential in-vivo homing of systemically administered peptide ART-2-displaying liposomes
entrapping a near-infrared dye (Cyanine 7) to arthritic joints of mice with CIA; and (b) To examine the
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of liposomal MTX delivery in mice having CIA. Aim 2: (a) To
validate the comparative efficacy of MTX delivery via peptide ART-2-displaying liposomes, control liposomes,
and free drug in suppressing arthritis in CIA mice; and (b) To determine the relative multiorgan toxicity of these
three drug delivery modalities to assess their comparative therapeutic efficacy/toxicity profiles. We believe that
with appropriate validation, this technology can be adapted and further refined for use in Veterans with RA."
10804617,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HI) complicates 2-6 per 1,000 term births and is associated with significant
mortality and poor neurologic outcomes. HI is also the leading cause of neonatal seizures (NS). Current
treatments are both ineffective and potentially harmful. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that neonatal
seizures independently worsen brain injury after neonatal HI. Whether neonatal seizures are a critical second
hit after HI or just a biomarker of injury severity has been a long-debated question and we now have the
technologies available to address it at the temporal and cellular resolution necessary to answer it. Specifically,
in vivo real-time monitoring of seizures and neuronal death overcomes many of the limitations of past studies
to enable a more rigorous understanding of these dynamic processes. The immediate goals of this proposal
are to validate two-photon imaging methods for in vivo real-time seizure and cell death monitoring in a neonatal
pup and to define the relationship between neuronal seizure burden and the probability of cell death in a
neonatal HI model. Transgenic mouse lines expressing neuronal fluorescent proteins and calcium indicators
will undergo neonatal HI and be followed with chronic time-lapse two-photon imaging. The experiments
proposed will generate high-resolution correlational data between seizure burden and the probability of
neuronal death. The long-term goal is to obtain definitive data indicating whether NS are independently harmful
or not after HI, which is essential to determine how aggressively to treat patients and how to prioritize research
efforts to develop improved NS treatment strategies. The techniques and data acquired in this proposal will be
applied to future NIH-funded studies by the applicant to examine these processes and test treatments in this
clinically relevant pathophysiologic condition.
This proposal combines innovative and rigorous methodologies with directly translational implications,
excellent mentorship in science and career development in the laboratory as well as through the applicant's
scientific advisory committee, and extensive institutional resources at Massachusetts General Hospital and
Harvard Medical School. Completing the proposed aims in conjunction with the applicant's career development
plan will lead to the independence of the applicant as a clinician-scientist by the end of the award period. The
proposal closely reflects the applicant's research and clinical interests and provides key training to accomplish
the applicant's long-term career goal to become an expert in the clinical care of neonates and infants with
epilepsy while conducting laboratory-based research into mechanisms of and therapeutic strategies for brain
injury, seizures, and epileptogenesis in the developing brain."
10733451,"Current lung cancer screening eligibility guidelines were developed in a civilian population and miss the
majority of Veterans who develop lung cancer. The guidelines include 50-80 year old heavy smokers, with a 20
or more pack years history, who either currently smoke or quit within the last 15 years. These criteria only
capture 20-35% of lung cancers in the civilian population and Veterans. Furthermore, Veterans suffer from
lung cancer at higher rates than the rest of the United States population, smoke more, and have unique
exposures to known causes of lung cancer including Agent Orange, asbestos, diesel fumes, ionizing radiation
and Open Burn Pit hydrocarbons. Veterans also have additional risk factors for lung cancer such as race, low
socio-economic status, previous history of cancer, HIV, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) each of which have been shown to increase lung cancer risk. Other, population specific
models effectively identify at risk subgroups who may benefit from screening, but none of these models have
been validated in Veterans and none consider Veterans’ unique risks. A personalized and Veteran-specific
model that adds service-related lung cancer risks and leads to the identification of high-risk groups that may
benefit from lung cancer screening is needed. The objective of this proposal is to combine general population
and Veteran-specific lung cancer risk factors into a Veteran's lung cancer screening eligibility model. Our
overall hypothesis is that service histories and novel risk factors can be used in a Veteran-specific lung cancer
risk model to broaden the population who may benefit from lung cancer screening. This effort to improve
Veterans’ health through the early detection of lung cancer with screening has two aims.
In Aim 1 we will define and discover novel phenotypes associated with increased lung cancer risk in
Veterans that include longitudinal clinical and military service-specific exposures. We will generate a
comprehensive, longitudinal set of lung cancer risk factors from all Veterans who have received care at a VA
facility in the last decade. We will use linked Department of Defense service and VA Electronic Health Record
(EHR) data to identify service-related exposures and lung cancer risk factors. Using artificial intelligence, we
will mine unstructured text data from clinical notes radiological reports to discover novel data pattern
(phenotypes) that help predict future lung cancer diagnosis. We hypothesize that we will accurately determine
risk variables used in current eligibility models and discover a set of novel Veteran-specific phenotypes
associated with lung cancer risk. In Aim 2 we will build a Veteran-specific lung cancer screening model
and compare it to existing screening eligibility criteria and models. We will use a combination of standard
lung cancer risk variables, military service-specific risk factors and novel discovered EHR lung cancer risk
phenotypes to develop a lung cancer screening model. The variables for this model will include a rich mosaic
of static and time varying metrics (smoking behavior, lab values, pulmonary function, etc.), lung cancer risk
EHR phenotypes (COPD, HIV, etc.), and service-specific risks (Agent Orange, asbestos, etc.). We will
compare our new model to the existing lung cancer screening guidelines, the Bach, Liverpool Lung Project and
PLCO screening eligibility models. We hypothesize that a Veteran-specific model will identify more at-risk
individuals with greater accuracy and calibration compared to current screening eligibility models.
With nationally recognized leaders in lung cancer, informatics, VA data use, machine learning, epidemiology,
and biostatistics, we are uniquely positioned to accomplish these goals. At the completion of this proposal, a
Veteran-specific model will be developed and compared to existing lung cancer screening eligibility models for
at-risk Veterans."
10814799,"Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) remains a major clinical challenge. Although androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT) is effective in treating PCa, majority of the patients quickly develop resistance to therapy and the tumor
relapses as hormone refractory castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Men with CRPC frequently
progress to an aggressive lethal disease that metastasizes to bones and other visceral organs accounting for
high morbidity and mortality. Transcriptional activation of steroid receptor coactivator-2 (SRC-2; also known as
NCOA2/TIF2/GRIP1) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of PCa by driving a metabolic switch towards de
novo fatty acid biosynthesis. Although increased lipogenesis is a known hallmark of hormone refractory PCa
progression, it is less clear how mitochondrial enzymes communicate with nuclear receptor coregulators to
rapidly fuel and support fat biosynthesis. Our preliminary findings indicate that sustained activity of mitochondrial
aconitase (ACO2) enzyme is critical for regulating citrate synthesis. We found that acetylation of ACO2 is
essential for enzyme functions, which is negatively regulated by sirtuin-3 (SIRT3). In human prostate cancer
patients, SIRT3 expression is repressed and increased expression of SRC-2 with concomitant reduction of
SIRT3 was found to be a genetic hallmark in metastatic PCa. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the
transcriptional coregulator SRC-2 drives the nuclear-mitochondrial regulatory axis by repressing tumor
suppressor SIRT3 thus promoting prostate tumor survival and metastasis competence. So our objectives in this
proposal are (1) to investigate the mechanisms regulating sustained activation of mitochondrial ACO2 to promote
lipogenesis, (2) define the role of nuclear receptor coregulator SRC-2 regulating SIRT3 expression, and (3)
evaluate the impact of this nuclear-mitochondrial regulatory axis on prostate tumor survival and adaptation
leading to bone colonization and growth. Our study will uncover molecular links between mitochondrial
metabolism and transcriptional regulation that enables hormone refractory PCa adaptation, survival and
ultimately metastatic competency."
10815850,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cancer cells co-opt autophagy - an evolutionarily conserved cellular recycling pathway - to maintain
metabolic fitness. Prior studies have shown that Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDA) up-regulates
autophagy and lysosomes – acidic organelles where autophagic cargo is degraded – to dramatically increase
the bulk breakdown and recycling of diverse intracellular substrates. An additional, less well understood
function of autophagy is the selective removal of specific proteins in order to endow PDA cells with
enhanced fitness.
 We now show that the autophagy-lysosome pathway selectively targets major histocompatibility
complex class I (MHC-I) protein for degradation as a mechanism of immune evasion. Through affinity-
based capture of intact lysosomes (LysoIP) from normal and PDA cell lines coupled with proteomics-based
analysis, we identified MHC-I as a significantly enriched lysosomal substrate in PDA cells. Consistent with this
finding, immuno-fluorescence staining demonstrates that, unlike normal cells where MHC-I localizes to the
plasma membrane (PM), in PDA cell lines and primary patient PDA specimens, MHC-I is trapped inside
autophagosomes and lysosomes. Importantly, tumor-specific suppression of autophagy is sufficient to 1)
stabilize and re-localize MHC-I to the PM, 2) increase antigen presentation and 3) boost T cell mediated tumor
killing in vitro and in vivo. Building on these findings the goal of this study is to determine the molecular
mechanisms underlying aberrant MHC-I trafficking, and to identify targetable nodes that can be manipulated to
restore MHC-I on the cell surface of PDA cells. Our revised application will leverage the combined power of
biochemistry, genetics, organelle purification and proteomics, a novel mouse model and patient PDA samples
to address the following specific aims: 1) determine how post-translational modifications of MHC-I cooperate
with the autophagy machinery to facilitate capture by autophagosomes, 2) identify where along its trafficking
route is MHC-I diverted to autophagosomes and 3) determine when during the course of PDA evolution does
MHC-I dysregulation occur and can we exploit this information to establish more effective strategies to enhance
antigen presentation and immune mediated tumor killing.
 In summary, our discovery of autophagy dependent degradation of MHC-I highlights an important new
paradigm for immune evasion in PDA and potentially other cancers. Findings from our proposed studies will
determine key molecular mechanisms underlying MHC-I dysregulation and establish new nodes that can be
targeted to restore antigen presentation in PDA."
10834019,"The essence of an immune system is to ensure defense against pathogens without collateral damage to
self. In plants, this is accomplished, in part, through the regulation of the immune signal salicylic acid (SA).
Production of SA during the effector-triggered immunity (ETI) is associated with programmed cell death
(PCD) of the infected cells to restrict pathogen growth at the site of infection and survival of distal cells with
broad-spectrum systemic acquired resistance (SAR). This binary function of SA is achieved through
activities of NPR1. NPR1 is not only a master immune regulator, but also involved in key cellular functions,
such as the circadian clock. In the absence of pathogen challenge, SA is rhythmically produced through the
direct regulation of the clock component CHE and subsequently controls the nuclear translocation of NPR1.
NPR1 is required for the expression of not only SA-mediated defense genes, but also both morning and
evening clock genes. Hence, the npr1 mutant is hypersusceptible to infection and has significantly
dampened clock activities. However, how PCD is executed at the site of infection, how NPR1 inhibits PCD
in distal cells and promotes SAR, and what role the circadian clock plays in regulating SAR are long-
standing fundamental questions. This project will investigate how the nuclear pore complex permeability
and the nuclear Ca2+ are specifically increased in executing ETI/PCD in infected cells and test the
hypothesis that NPR1 reprograms the defense transcriptome and promotes survival of distal cells as a
substrate adaptor for the Cul3 ubiquitin ligase complex through the formation of SA-induced NPR1
condensates in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The project will also determine the mechanism by
which CHE is activated in systemic tissue to induce SA synthesis and explain why a clock component is
involved in regulating this key step of SAR. Finally, genetic analysis will be performed to provide the
molecular basis for the clock-mediated gating of the SA immune response towards the morning in avoiding
plant desiccation at night and to highlight the importance of time-of-the-day chemical application in
agriculture and in medicine for maximizing efficacy and reducing side effects. This continuously developing
project fits the NIGMS mission of “understanding the principles, mechanisms, and processes that underlie
living organisms, often using research models” and the MIRA funding model. Besides its obvious
significance to basic biology and agriculture, the project may have even broader implications because SA is
the oldest herbal medicine known to mankind. In recent years, aspirin (acetylated SA) has been repurposed
in treating cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer (e.g., colon cancer). Non-acetylated SA
derivatives have shown promising results in treating type II diabetes in clinical trials. However, the
underlying mechanisms for these diverse medicinal effects are not completely understood and the issue
over how to enhance the drug efficacy while reducing the side effect (e.g., bleeding) has to be addressed."

The microbiome has been associated with disease processes throughout the body and is therefore an
intriguing target for therapeutics and diagnostics. Multiple preclinical studies have shown that the microbiome
can influence bone. Our prior work has indicated that modifications to the microbiome during bone acquisition
can influence bone strength by modifying bone tissue quality. “Bone quality” describes aspects of bone that are
not well represented by measures of bone mineral density (BMD). Our findings raise the intriguing possibility
that microbiome-based therapies may be able to improve bone tissue quality – a contributor to bone strength
that is not directly targeted by existing therapies. In the proposed work we ask: What microbial taxa within the
gut microbiota are responsible for changes in bone strength and tissue quality? What is the pathway linking the
gut microbiota to bone strength and tissue quality? and; How does the influence of the microbiome on bone
strength vary based on age and the stage of skeletal maturity (growing v. skeletally mature)? The proposed
work is based on our PRELIMINARY STUDIES in which we associated microbiome-induced impairment of
bone strength with large changes in the microbial taxonomic and genetic composition as well as impaired
production of vitamin K by the gut microbiota and reduced abundance of matrix bound osteocalcin (a vitamin K
dependent protein). The proposed work has three aims: 1) Determine the components of the gut microbiota
that lead to impaired bone strength and quality; 2) Determine the dependence of microbiome-induced
reductions in bone tissue quality on microbiome-derived vitamin K.; and 3) Determine the modifications in bone
matrix caused by changes in the microbiome in an adult skeleton as compared to the growing skeleton. The
proposed work includes manipulation of the gut microbiota through transfer of gut flora among animals using
gnotobiotic chambers and depletion of microbes (“knock out”) from the gut microbiota using narrow spectrum
antibiotics. Taxonomic and functional characterization of the gut microbiota and examination of the resulting
bone biomechanical, chemical and geometrical phenotypes is performed at the whole organ, micro- and
nanoscale. By establishing a mechanistic relationship between the microbiome and bone strength in both the
growing and adult skeleton, the proposed work will perform the necessary first steps toward the identification of
microbiome therapeutics that modulate bone tissue quality to reduce bone fragility."

10814789,"In the US, approximately 10,000 patients are newly diagnosed annually with cholangiocarcinoma, and their 5-year
survival rate is less than 10%. Heterogeneity in cellular origins and molecular signatures of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
(ICC) highlight the demand for biomarkers to stratify tumors and generate targeted therapies. Besides biliary epithelial cells
(BECs), hepatocytes (HCs) have been considered as a cellular origin of human ICC. This is evident by rapid HC-driven
ICC induction through the co-expression of activated AKT (myrAKT) and Notch intracellular domain (NICD) in mouse
HCs using sleeping beauty transposon system.
 Our preliminary analysis using large ICC patient cohorts demonstrates that the genetic signature of AKT-NICD
(AN)-driven murine ICC correlates significantly with ~30% of human ICC, supporting the clinical relevance of this ICC
model. Deletion of either Sox9 or Yap delayed ICC formation, and instead induced AN-driven SOX9-/YAP+ or SOX9+/YAP-
ICC respectively, which also have been identified in human ICC. These data indicate that Notch independently regulates
Sox9 and Yap in HC-driven ICC. Importantly, we found that co-repression of Yap and Sox9 completely prevents Notch-
dependent ICC formation. However, the mechanisms of tumorigenesis driven by YAP and SOX9, as well as their
interactions with AKT signaling, remain poorly understood. Based on our preliminary observations, our central hypothesis
is that HC-driven ICC tumor growth depends on transcriptional and epigenetic alterations driven by two major downstream
effectors of Notch signaling, SOX9 and YAP, alongside AKT signaling.
 In aim 1, we aim to test therapeutic effect of co-repression of YAP and SOX9 in advanced ICCs to better address
the clinical need for late-stage therapy. We will employ genetic AN-ICC model as well as liver toxin-based ICC model
using innovative inducible gene modulation systems to induce simultaneous, conditional and inducible Sox9 and YAP
repression in advanced ICC. In aim 2, we are proposing 3 subaims to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying AN-
mediated HC-driven ICC formation. First, using ChIP-seq and bioinformatic tools, we will identify both the unique and the
overlapping downstream targets regulated by Sox9 and Yap during HC-derived ICC formation. Second, we will elucidate
the pathologic role of the NICD-YAP/TEAD-DNMT1 epigenetic axis in HC-driven ICC development by modulating this
axis with pharmacological and genetic tools in the in vivo system and studying its effects on the methylome of ICC tumors.
Pursuing these 2 subaims, we will identify downstream effectors of Sox9 and Yap for more selective and safer therapeutic
targeting in ICC. Third, we aim to elucidate how AKT mediates HC-to-ICC transformation, which remains poorly
understood.
 The successful execution of this study will 1) provide an essential evidence for considering SOX9 and YAP co-
inhibition as an attractive candidate for precision medicine therapy, which is theorized to be the most effective approach to
conquer lethal tumor, and 2) reveal the key downstream effectors for AKT, SOX9 and YAP which will help to develop
more potent therapeutic options for ICC."

Development of an oral cancer-specific quadra-functional theranostic platform for advanced bladder
cancer
SUMMARY
Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer and seventh most common cause of cancer death in men.
Almost all bladder cancer deaths are caused by advanced bladder cancer (aBC) which is the focus of this
project. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is only moderately effective, costly,
inconveniently administrated through intravenous infusion and associated with significant immune-mediated
toxicity secondary to delivery of ICIs to and activation of immune response against non-cancerous tissues. The
goal of this project is to develop oral cancer-specific theranostic platform that can not only deliver an ICI to
cancer sites with enhanced efficacy, decreased toxicity, low cost and convenient oral administration, but can
also be used for photodynamic diagnosis and therapy. In this project, cancer-specific attenuated Salmonella
will specifically deliver a protein photosensitizer to cancer sites which is then activated by light to emit red
fluorescence for photodynamic diagnosis, and to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) for photodynamic
therapy. Salmonella itself can also modify and create pro-immune tumor microenvironment (microbiotherapy).
Furthermore, the cancer-specific Salmonella can express an ICI locally at the cancer sites to activate anti-
cancer immunity while eliminating immune-mediated toxicity associated with intravenous immunotherapy. More
importantly, photodynamic therapy, microbiotherapy and immunotherapy can achieve synergistic anti-cancer
effects and enhance the efficacy. Four specific aims are proposed in this project. Aim I is to determine the most
effective cancer-specific Salmonella regimen for bladder cancer immunotherapy; Aim II is to determine whether
the cancer-specific Salmonella can eradicate locally advanced bladder cancer, induce abscopal effect, and
prevent cancer metastasis; Aim III is to determine the underlying mechanisms of action and resistance; and
Aim IV is to determine the potential of the cancer-specific Salmonella for photodynamic diagnosis.
Accomplishment of the proposed work will lead to the consultation with the US Food and Drug Administration
for clinical trials in human patients."
10739303,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Currently no cure exists for Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Due to immune-mediated destruction of the insulin-
producing  cells, treatment of T1D is limited to daily exogenous insulin administration. Needed are
immunotherapies that effectively suppress  cell autoimmunity longterm in order to prevent and treat T1D. One
approach is the administration of cell autoantigens to induce differentiation of adaptive regulatory CD4+ T
cells (aTreg). The approach is appealing since autoimmunity can be selectively targeted while leaving acquired
immunity unperturbed. A major hurdle, however, is inducing a sufficiently sized and subset diverse aTreg pool,
while avoiding expansion of pathogenic effector T cells (Teff). The size and nature of the aTreg pool is
particularly important at late preclinical T1D stages and at the onset of clinical diabetes, when a high frequency
of diabetogenic CD4+ and CD8+ Teff is found. This R21 outlines a novel approach to enhance the efficacy of
antigen therapy by “tuning” the function of CD4. CD4 binding to MHCII activates a signaling cascade that
contributes to overall TCR signaling strength. We hypothesize that modulating CD4 function and TCR signaling
strength, results in increased and selective induction of aTreg by antigen vaccination. In our model,
differentiation of aTreg subsets is determined by varying the level of coreceptor tuning (CoT). We will employ
nondepleting CD4 antibody to achieve CoT. Key objectives of this R21 are to gain initial insight into the
mechanism(s) by which CoT selectively promotes aTreg differentiation (Aim 1), and determine the therapeutic
efficacy of this combinatorial approach (Aim 2). If successful, combined CoT and self-antigen vaccination is
expected to be applicable not only for the prevention and treatment of T1D, but also for other T cell-mediated
autoimmune diseases and pathologies."
10906737,"The Oropharyngeal Microbiome in COVID-19
Summary (Abstract)
SARS-CoV-2 first infects the oropharynx and upper respiratory tract, where it either remains localized and is
cleared, or propagates to the lower respiratory tract where it can progress to pneumonia and respiratory failure.
Several patient factors correlate with increased COVID-19 severity, including older age, obesity and diabetes,
but the mechanisms linking these factors to COVID-19 pathogenesis are incompletely understood. What
determines the extent of SARS-CoV-2 upper respiratory tract (URT) replication and whether infection remains
localized or propagates to the lower respiratory tract (LRT) is therefore a critical knowledge gap.
Studies with other respiratory viruses (RSV, influenza) suggest that the local URT microbiome can regulate
immune responses and influence lung consequences of infection. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2
is an interferon-stimulated gene, suggesting that it could be modulated by local microbiota. Thus, the microbiome
could play a key role in local SARS-CoV-2 replication and consequences of infection through mechanisms
involving both immune modulation and viral receptor expression. Furthermore, we and others have shown that
the oropharyngeal microbiome is the principal source of lung microbiota, which are derived from the URT by
microaspiration, and so factors that affect the oropharyngeal microbiota likely also impact the lung microbiome
with similar effects.
We investigated hospitalized COVID-19 patients and found that the oropharyngeal (OP) microbiome differed
markedly from healthy subjects and also from hospitalized patients with other illnesses. The OP microbiome at
early sampling points correlated with maximum disease severity over the course of hospitalization. The OP
microbiome also correlated with systemic immune parameters in blood. These findings raise the possibility that
the microbiome in the oropharynx and upper respiratory region may influence severity of COVID-19. However,
there is limited knowledge on the OP microbiome in groups and comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, elderly)
associated with severe COVID-19 disease that might underlie this relationship.
Our hypothesis is that the oropharyngeal microbiome plays a key role in regulating consequences of SARS-
CoV-2 infection through modulation of ACE2 expression and/or immunity that determine whether infection is
locally contained in the URT or propagates to LRT involvement to cause severe disease. This mechanism may
act locally within the URT and also, by URT-LRT microbiome crosstalk, on the LRT. Our aims are to:
(1) Define the oropharyngeal microbiome of individuals at risk of mild vs severe COVID-19, relationship
to expression of ACE2 and relevant mucosal genes, and to microbiome communities seen in early
COVID-19 patients.
(2) Determine the effect of human-derived oropharyngeal microbiome communities, introduced in a
novel murine model, on ACE2 and immune genes in oropharyngeal and lower airway epithelial cells."
10878691,"Medications to treat substance use disorders (SUD) exist for many drugs of abuse, but not for psychostimulants,
such as amphetamine (AMPH), and methamphetamine. They are also lacking for increasingly used synthetic
drugs designed to mimic the actions of known psychostimulants. Both known and new psychoactive substances
continue to pose a major and increasing public health threat. To develop effective treatments, the mechanisms by
which these stimulants produce their abuse-related effects need to be better understood. Many stimulants interact
with the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT), which is thought to mediate their abuse-related effects. However,
strategies targeting DAT have yielded little to no benefit in the treatment of psychostimulant addiction, raising the
possibility that these stimulants have significant actions elsewhere to modulate dopaminergic neurotransmission.
Consistent with this, a rapidly growing literature supports a prominent role for organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3)
in regulating dopaminergic neurotransmission. Our preliminary data support this idea, showing that decynium-22
(D22), an inhibitor of OCT3, inhibits DA release in vivo in male OCT3 wild-type (WT) mice, an effect lost in
constitutive OCT3 knockout (KO) mice. Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that AMPH-induced substrate efflux
could be inhibited by D22 in a manner independent of cocaine-sensitive transporters. These finding were paralleled
by a loss of conditioned place preference (CPP) for AMPH in male mice, and an attenuation in female OCT3 KO,
with D22 preventing CPP in both WT sexes. Preliminary data in male mice show that the dose-response curve for
self-administration of AMPH is dramatically downward and rightward shifted in male OCT3 KO mice relative to their
WT counterpart. In light of these findings, we have established and validated OCT3 floxed mice so as to examine
the role of OCT3 in the absence of any developmental compensation that may occur in germline KOs. Harnessing
the power of these mice, new data show that tamoxifen inducible or viral KO of OCT3 robustly attenuates AMPH-
evoked DA release and CPP. Proposed studies will interrogate OCT3’s role in the ability of AMPH to impact
behavior and DA efflux by testing the novel and potentially transformative hypothesis that AMPH driven DA release
is not mediated solely by DAT but by reverse transport via OCT3 as well. Thus, DAT-OCT3 redundancy may
explain why DAT-based therapeutics have been unsuccessful in treating AMPH use disorders. We will use a
combination of pharmacology, novel and established transgenic mouse models (DA neuron-specific vs glia-
specific), and brain-region specific viral knockdown, to determine the role of OCT3 in AMPH-induced behavioral
effects (locomotion, rearing, stereotypy, sensitization, CPP, self-administration) (Aim 1), and AMPH-induced DA
efflux and clearance in vivo (Aim 2). In Aim 3 we will determine how tamoxifen inducible KO or viral KO of OCT3
impacts key elements in DA signaling and how OCT3 adapts to chronic AMPH self-administration. These studies
will fill fundamental knowledge gaps about the importance of OCT3 in abuse-related effects of AMPH, and its
congeners, which will help identify novel molecular targets for medications to treat AMPH addiction."
10817003,"ABSTRACT
Maternal metabolism during pregnancy is a key contributor to developmental origins of metabolic disease.
Offspring exposed to maternal hyperglycemia and obesity have increased rates of obesity and disordered
glucose metabolism. The lactation period is also a critical window for programming. Lactogenesis initiates in
the second half of gestation, thus human milk (HM) biosynthesis is susceptible maternal metabolism.
Interindividual variation in HM nutrients reveals the influence of maternal metabolism on milk biosynthesis. A
knowledge gap exists as to whether HM composition alters developmental pathways of offspring programmed
in utero. Maternal metabolic states including gestational diabietes (GDM) and obesity alter HM nutrient profiles,
including milk fatty acids (FA). Our studies identified altered HM linoleic acid and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid
(DGLA) in conditions of maternal diabetes, hyperglycemia, and obesity, as well as HM palmitic acid and DGLA
associations with infant growth. However, any impact of maternal metabolism across the entire range of
glycemia on both HM composition and offspring programming has not been evaluated in context of detailed
profiling of in utero exposures. Our goal is to understand how HM susceptibility to maternal metabolism
impacts offspring metabolism, identifying interventions to mitigate adverse developmental programming. This
proposal’s objective is to determine the impact of maternal glycemia in pregnancy on HM composition and
effects of HM nutrients on offspring adiposity. Translational science approaches will determine how maternal
glycemia alters mammary gland epithelial cell gene expression and how HM lipids across the range of
maternal glycemia regulate infant adipoctyes. Our overarching hypothesis is that maternal glycemia in normal
and pathologic ranges impacts HM composition, which in turn influences offspring metabolic programming as
reflected by early childhood adiposity. Capitalizing on the detailed metabolic phenotyping of the GO MOMs
cohort, we will conduct prospective HM profiling at 1, 2 and 6 months post-partum in a cohort of 450 women to
associate maternal glycemia during and after pregnancy, focusing on HM lipids known to regulate offspring
adiposity (Aim 1). Mammary epithelial cells shed in expressed HM will be evaluated using transcriptomics
(SubAim 1). For reproducibility, HM lipids will be compared to a separate validation cohort enrolling women
with GDM. We will measure offspring body composition to discern adiposity at months 1, 2, and 6 and 2 years,
accounting for childhood diet (Aim 2). A human infant preadipocyte strain will be exposed to HM lipids collected
and grouped by quartiles of maternal glycemia to determine mechanisms altering infant adipocyte development
(Aim 3). Completing the aims will define HM composition in a pregnancy cohort with comprehensive metabolic
profiling throughout pregnancy and lactation across the range of glycemia and BMI. Offspring growth and
translational studies will advance understanding of how lactation exposures modify in utero programming. This
will further the field by revealing interventions to reduce risk of adverse offspring metabolic health."

worldwide, and an estimated 23 million people affected by unilateral corneal blindness globally. In a conservative

4% of people aged over 40. Given the large prevalence of corneal disease and the near-impossibility of

diseases, and treatment. Additionally, the cornea is the most commonly transplanted tissue worldwide.
Gabor-domain optical coherence microscopy (GDOCM) is a high-resolution, non-invasive imaging technology
that can visualize microscopic structures in vivo in 3D. Preliminary data suggest that GDOCM has the following
key advantages over existing corneal imaging techniques, which include specular and confocal microscopy: 1)
10-100x increase in field of view – this will lead to more accurate qualification of the corneal tissue, since a larger
area can be assessed; 2) simultaneous measure of corneal thickness, quantification of endothelial cell density,
as well as identification of morphological variations due to corneal disease – this will lead to full corneal evaluation
in one instrument; 3) 3D imaging capability at the cellular level of the mosaic of translucent corneal cells – this
will enable a detailed understanding the volumetric progression of the diseases.
We have assembled an exceptionally strong team of clinical investigators to collaborate on this proposal, and
with their help we have identified four use cases for clinical application of our dual-imaging technology to image
the cornea with volumetric cellular-resolution. We envision that in the future the dual OCT (optical coherence
tomography) and GDOCM instrument enabled by this Phase II SBIR proposal will provide an image-guidance
method to assist clinicians in the assessment and treatment of corneal diseases and other diseases affecting
the anterior segment of the eye, including diabetes and glaucoma."

 This study directly responds to NIMHD Program Announcement for Health Services Research on Minority
Health and Health Disparities (PAR-20-310). Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD), which include
depression and/or anxiety in the year before and/or after delivery, are common complications of pregnancy,
affecting up to one in four women, with costs over $15 billion per year in the US. PMAD can negatively affect
mothers, babies, and families beyond the perinatal period, and have lasting clinical and economic effects. PMAD
treatment can improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes, yet mental health services are rarely used.
 No comprehensive data source documents the: 1) magnitude, 2) predictors, and 3) variation in disparities by
race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography in healthcare utilization or obstetric delivery outcomes
among women with PMAD. Almost no evidence documents the impact of community characteristics on these
outcomes. There is no national plan for how best to address PMAD, overall, or within high-risk subgroups.
 Using data from publicly (Medicaid) and privately (Optum) insured women with PMAD, state survey data,
input from a panel of perinatal mental health services and policy experts, and interviews with state maternal and
infant health (MIH) and MH policy makers, we will: 1) identify patient-level clinical characteristics
associated with MH and overall perinatal utilization and delivery-related outcomes among
women with diagnosed PMAD, and establish accurate national and state-level estimates of
disparities in care patterns and outcomes, including MH utilization, overall utilization, and
delivery-outcomes; 2) determine contributions of community-level characteristics to perinatal
utilization and delivery outcomes among women with PMAD using data from Pregnancy Risk
Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), Area Health Resource File (AHRF), and National Mental Health
Services Survey (N-MHSS); and 3) collaborate with an expert panel to develop an evidence-based
policymaking guide for PMAD, which we will use to interview state maternal and infant health
and mental health policy officials. Using Aim 1-2 findings and expert panel input, we will develop an EBP
guide for PMAD. This guide will provide structure for interviews with state maternal and infant health and
mental health policy officials from states with high and low relative performance on PMAD treatment and
outcomes to help interpret quantitative findings, tailor recommendations, and assist in future PMAD
policymaking initiatives.
 Given the dearth of research on disparities in addressing PMAD and associated utilization and delivery
outcomes, and the high, inter-generational costs for mother and baby of ineffectively managed PMAD, this
innovative, large-scale investigation will provide evidence for future policymaking and clinical interventions. Our
findings and policy guidance could address disparities in outcomes for high cost, high risk subpopulations."

precursor lesions hold important clues to the developmental origins of MPNST and for identifying novel
therapeutic strategies for MPNST treatment and prevention. Work by our team of intramural and extramural
investigators has demonstrated that malignant transformation of PNF often occurs through the development of
atypical neurofibroma (ANF), characterized by distinct histopathological and molecular features including copy
number loss of the CDKN2A/B tumor suppressor locus. Natural history data shows that these pre-malignant
lesions are direct precursors of MPNST. While clinical trials lead by our group have spurred transformative
advances for the treatment of NF1-associated PNF, including FDA and EMA approval of selumetininb (MEK
inhibitor) for the treatment of pediatric PNF, we have discovered that MEK inhibition does not induce treatment
responses in most ANF and does not appear to prevent MPNST. Surgical resection of ANF has become a
strategy to prevent MPNST. However, surgery may be associated with significant morbidity or infeasible due to
ANF location or presence of multiple ANF. To address the challenges of treating and preventing malignant
transformation of ANF precursor lesions in this vulnerable patient population, we will leverage a robust
infrastructure spanning the preclinical-to-clinical continuum to rapidly test and translate novel therapeutic
strategies to the clinic for the treatment of ANF and to identify response biomarkers. Our work will center on
CDK4/6 inhibition to strategically oppose the dysregulated signaling induced by CDKN2A/B loss. The
overarching goals of this project are to (1) develop single agent and/or combination therapies for ANF informed
by preclinical murine models that spontaneously develop ANF and MPNST, allowing interrogation of therapeutic
interventions at each stage of tumor progression, (2) establish a pipeline to accelerate the translation of first-in-
kind therapies to the clinic to effectively treat ANF and prevent malignant transformation, and (3) identify robust
molecular biomarkers associated with treatment response. Harnessing the specialized expertise of translational
and clinical investigators at the NCI, and extramural experts in NF1 biology and therapeutic development, this
collaborative effort will employ state-of-the-art approaches in preclinical modeling, window of opportunity trials,
single cell analytics, and non-invasive liquid biopsy coupled with integrative multi-omic profiling to understand
ANF to MPNST evolution and drive therapeutic innovation for increasingly aggressive orphan cancers where no
current treatment options exist."

This is a new application of the University of Colorado T32 postdoctoral training program in anesthesiology
research. The broad objective of this training program is to provide training to MD postdoctoral fellows in clinical
and basic science related to anesthesiology and perioperative medicine. We propose the training of one fellow
per year who will spend 2 years cumulative time in research in one of the participating training faculty's
laboratories or clinical research setting. We propose to recruit 2 fellows the first year to create a cohort and the
opportunity for peer mentoring. In year 3 we will again recruit 2 fellows and recruit our final fellow in year 4, for a
total of 5 fellows over the 5 year duration of the grant. The training faculty are from several departments within
the University of Colorado System, including Anesthesiology, Division of Cardiology, Cell & Molecular Biology,
Emergency Medicine, Psychology and Neuroscience at CU Boulder. Research opportunities are offered by 21
NIH-funded faculty mentors, 9 of whom are in the department of Anesthesiology, with strong records of training
postdoctoral fellows. The research opportunities are organized into three major research areas relevant to
anesthesiology 1) Neuroscience, cell injury & repair and pain 2) Clinical and Translational Drug abuse and 3)
Trauma, coagulation and cardiac physiology. We have developed a didactic program that will provide training in
research methods, presentation skills (written and oral), grant writing and responsible conduct of research. In
addition to our outstanding group of faculty mentors, we have an external scientific advisory committee and an
executive committee that will assist the Program Directors in the selection of candidates and oversight of the
training program. The specific aims/goals of the training program are:
 1) Recruit outstanding anesthesiology postdoctoral fellows from a diverse background pulling from a local
 and national applicant pool.
 2) To develop an outstanding training program using didactic and experiential training to provide scientific
 training and the practical skills needed to successfully compete for National funding and develop and
 independent research career in anesthesiology.
 3) Assemble a group of faculty mentors that are not only highly successful scientists, but excellent mentors
 that help create a supportive mentoring environment that keeps postdoctoral fellows engaged,
 enthusiastic about research and moving forward towards their career goals of becoming leading
 academic anesthesiologists."
10766822,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Ollier disease (OD) and Maffucci syndrome (MS) are untreatable, poorly characterized, newly recognized cancer
susceptibility syndromes. Their genetic bases and pathways responsible for the formation and progression of
benign and malignant tumors are not known. Our long-term goal is to identify pharmacological approaches to
treat bone deformities and malignant transformation in patients with OD and MS and to prevent/treat related non-
syndromic forms of cancers associated with these conditions. Our central hypothesis in this application is that
OD and MS are distinct under-characterized cancer susceptibility syndromes caused by variants in multiple
genes that disrupt the HIF-1 pathway. The rationale for our project is that phenotypic characterization and
identification of the genetic causes of OD and MS have the potential to offer a strong scientific framework
whereby new pharmacological strategies to cancer therapy in these patients and patients with the non-syndromic
forms of the same cancers, such as chondrosarcomas and gliomas, can be developed. The central hypothesis
will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Comprehensively define the phenotypic features of patients
with OD and MS; 2) Discover the causative genes and variants of OD and MS in previously uncharacterized
cases; 3) Determine the effect of causative variants of OD or MS in the HIF-1 pathway. We will pursue these
aims using an innovative combination of genomic and functional techniques applied to a unique set of deeply
phenotyped patients. The proposed research is significant because it will: 1) Define the natural history of novel
cancer susceptibility syndromes; 2) Establish a unique OD and MS germline and tumor sample collection for
research use; 3) Identify the genetic bases of untreatable cancers, and; 4) Determine the role of the HIF-1
pathway in OD and MS. Our expected outcomes are to define the responsible variants and genes that cause
benign and malignant tumor formation in OD and MS and to fully elucidate the phenotypic features and natural
history of these disorders. Our results will have an important positive impact providing new opportunities for the
development of novel pharmacological therapies to treat patients with these diseases as well as those with
related non-syndromic forms of cancers such as of chondrosarcomas and gliomas."

 glutamatergic crosstalk at tripartite synapses

 Project Description
1 Introduction and Background
Transmission at chemical synapses is the central mechanism by which information is
transferred between neurons. Synaptic connections such as glutamatergic excitatory
synapses are often perceived and modeled as point-to-point connections. However, there is
substantial evidence that crosstalk between various glutamatergic synapses can occur when
the presynaptically released glutamate is sensed not only by its direct postsynaptic partner
but also by nearby synapses of the same and other neurons [4]. Notably, this phenomenon
termed “glutamate spillover” not only defines the input-specificity of a given synaptic
connection and its crosstalk to neighboring synapses, but is also involved in and controlled by
activity-dependent plasticity [1, 7, 8].
 How easily glutamate escapes from its release site and how far it spreads into the tissue
depends on the morphological and molecular properties of the extracellular space (ECS) as
well as on the efficacy of glutamate clearance, which primarily depends on astrocytic uptake
[11, 12]. We and others have shown that the efficacy of perisynaptic glutamate uptake by
astrocytes displays a remarkable heterogeneity between brain regions and, importantly, can
vary drastically from one synapse to the next within a brain region [3, 7, 8]. This is in part
because the morphological coverage of synapses by perisynaptic astrocyte processes (PAPs)
can differ strongly between individual synapses [14]. Moreover, the Henneberger lab has
recently shown that higher synaptic coverage by PAPs correlates with a higher local efficacy
of glutamate uptake [3]. We have also demonstrated that in addition to being heterogeneous,
astrocytic glutamate uptake and PAPs morphology both are controlled by neuronal plasticity
[1]. Moreover, glutamate uptake is governed by the transporters’ stoichiometry, importing one
glutamate molecule into the astrocyte by using the energy gained from co-transporting three
Na+ and one proton down the electrochemical gradients, whilst also exporting one K+ [12].
While the inwardly-directed Na+ gradient is the main driving force for glutamate uptake, recent
work by Rose lab and others have shown that glutamatergic activity causes local or global Na+
transients in astrocytes ([Na+]A) [15]. In the mouse hippocampus, astrocytic Na+ signals in fact
arise predominately due to the activity of glutamate transporters themselves, degrading the
Na+ gradient and thereby transiently weakening uptake capacity in a negative feedback-loop
[15-17]. In the neocortex, glutamatergic synaptic activity in addition results in prominent Na+
influx through NMDA receptors, boosting astrocyte Na+ gradients [18].
 Thus, it is increasingly appreciated that astrocytic glutamate uptake is neither static nor
uniform. First, it is functionally dependent on the gradients of the transported ions which
dynamically change with synaptic transmission [12]. Second, it is plastic because structural
remodeling of PAPs on time scales of minutes profoundly alters perisynaptic glutamate spread
[1]. Therefore, the emerging hypothesis is that the degree of glutamate spillover and,
therefore, synaptic crosstalk in most brain regions are dynamically regulated and controlled at
the level of the astrocytes. Furthermore, since a single astrocyte can contact thousands of
synapses of various neurons, it has the potential to locally control the crosstalk of many
synapses. In such a scenario, an astrocyte, or a subcellular domain of it, can coordinate
crosstalk between many glutamatergic synapses on different neurons. Thereby, astrocytes
and their PAPs set the spatial fidelity of glutamatergic synaptic transmission and as a
consequence profoundly control neuronal signal exchange.
 So far, these important hypotheses remain largely untested. We will fill this gap by
combining quantitative fluorescence imaging, astrocytic manipulations, and predictive
computer modelling. This will be accomplished by investigating perisynaptic astrocytic Na+
gradients, the main driving force of glutamate uptake, and local mechanisms controlling them

10931328,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Obesity is a well-established risk factor for developing cardiometabolic diseases such as diabetes and
hypertension. While the impact of obesity on reproductive health is less understood, studies conducted in high-
income countries have associated obesity with menstrual and ovulatory dysfunction and subsequent infertility.
These findings have significant public health implications for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where
access to assisted reproduction treatment remains practically nonexistent despite rapidly increasing obesity
prevalence. Obesity-related morbidity and mortality are particularly high among Pacific LMICs. However, few
studies have assessed the relationship between cardiometabolic and reproductive health in this region.
Previous attempts to characterize menstrual irregularity among Pacific Islander women have relied on
retrospective self-report of cycle length and variability, which is notoriously subject to recall bias and
interlocuter variation. No studies to date have characterized anovulatory cycles among Pacific Islander women.
This is likely because the gold-standard for determining ovulation involves daily transvaginal ultrasonography,
an invasive and resource-intensive procedure that is impractical for epidemiological studies.
 My proposal addresses these gaps through two scientific aims and five training aims that leverage an
existing cohort of approximately n=150 Samoan women aged 25-39, whose families Dr. Nicola Hawley
(sponsor) and colleagues have followed since 2015. These women have participated in health and wellbeing
assessments in 2015, 2017/2018, and 2019/2020. During the fourth data collection wave planned for 2022, I
will measure adiposity and prospectively assess ovulatory function. In Aim 1, I will examine associations
between menstrual irregularity and current adiposity and longitudinal trajectories of change in adiposity among
Samoan women. In Aim 2, I will biochemically evaluate the presence or absence of ovulation among regularly
menstruating women and explore the association between anovulation and BMI. Findings will provide critical
insight on secondary infertility among women with obesity and inform the development of protocols for
evaluating female reproductive potential in low-resource settings. Moreover, this project will shed light on the
dual burden of cardiometabolic and reproductive risk among Pacific Islander women, who despite having
among the highest obesity prevalence globally, are underrepresented in epidemiologic research.
 My training plan will enable me to develop research, clinical, and professional skills necessary to
become a physician-scientist who conducts longitudinal epidemiologic studies to investigate the impact of
obesity on maternal and child health outcomes in low-resource settings. My training plan outlines coursework,
mentored research, and clinical experiences to enhance my skills in biostatistics, epidemiological study design
and implementation, and reproductive endocrinology."
10791819,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) affects more than 16 million US adults, many of whom
experience high rates of acute care revisits (emergency department and hospital) after initial COPD
hospitalization. These frequent exacerbations, often due to transition of care (TOC) failures, lead to lung
function decline and earlier mortality. Large multi-site studies are needed to address ongoing gaps in
fundamental effectiveness and implementation data, before widescale implementation of effective COPD TOC
programs and successful reduction of revisits. My current NHLBI R01 aims to address these gaps in
effectiveness and implementation by testing COPD TOC programs across 20 diverse US hospitals to improve
health care delivery and outcomes for patients with COPD. My R01 simultaneously uses implementation
science (IS) and human-centered design (HCD) methods. While these methods are rigorous and
complimentary, integrating these qualitative approaches in a prospective manner could optimize their potential
to impact the design and implementation of interventions in order to obtain data and ultimately inform care
transformation. Further, standardizing metrics for evaluating and reporting COPD TOC program and revisit
data could significantly improve outcome comparisons between COPD TOC programs and studies. The K24
will allow me to address these methodology gaps by building upon my R01 research, mentoring program, and
infrastructure to develop, test, and disseminate integrated IS and HCD qualitative and quantitative methods for
use in Patient Oriented Research. I will collaborate with my mentees and R01 research team experts in IS and
HCD methods to develop an integrated approach named ""CHIMERA""; additionally, I will collaboratively
develop harmonized reporting metrics called ""SMART COPD"". I will complete these aims by working with my
mentees to develop, test, and disseminate the ""CHIMERA"" and ""SMART COPD"" tools. CHIMERA will use a
step-wise approach to identify HCD and IS domains and methods, followed by the use of logic models and
concept mapping of stakeholder assessments from my R01 Aim 1 to develop a CHIMERA “cross walk”
methodology that integrates both methods. CHIMERA will be tested in conjunction with my R01 Aims 2 and 3,
implementation and post-implementation. The SMART COPD metrics will be developed using systematic
literature review and a modified Delphi approach, in which our R01 team will identify and prioritize COPD TOC
Program metrics to standardize reporting. This K24 will allow me to provide mentoring opportunities to my
mentees through development of novel research tools. The enriched research program of my K24 entitled:
""SMART POR: Supporting and Mentoring Across Respiratory Topics in Patient Oriented Research"" will also
provide ample opportunities for me to support current and future research mentees to implement research and
drive investigator-based careers."

 Although interest has focused on crucial roles for amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau in
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), an earlier and persistent hypothesis attributes
cognitive impairment to loss of cholinergic signaling. We recently demonstrated that all these
elements are linked by Ly6h, an endogenous inhibitor of Ca2+-permeable alpha7 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). We found that amyloid beta reduces Ly6h, resulting in
increased assembly of alpha7 nAChRs and thus a conversion of basal cholinergic to neurotoxic
signaling. Importantly, we also found that Ly6h levels in temporal cortex and cerebrospinal fluid
are inversely correlated with disease severity in AD patients. The present proposal seeks to
complement these findings with related data in an animal model of AD. In particular, we will
determine the degree to which lentiviral knockdown of Ly6h in the hippocampus exacerbates AD-
driven increases in alpha7 nAChRs and phosphorylated tau. To correlate expected cellular effects
with changes in hippocampal-dependent behaviors, we will also test for worsening of performance
in Y-maze, Morris water maze and novel object recognition assays. We will also perform
pharmacological experiments on neurons from AD model mice to extend our in vitro results, which
suggest that Ly6h and alpha7 nAChRs reciprocally regulate each other, and that amyloid beta
requires the open conformation of alpha7 to drive this process. Lastly, we will correlate Ly6h levels
in CSF and exosomes with disease severity in individual patients, and we will develop a rapid
ELISA assay to allow for related measurements to be made more routinely. Results from
experiments in our proposal will thus provide an integrated overview about how Ly6h functions at
a molecular, cellular and behavioral level to contribute to AD pathogenesis. At the same time our
experiments will also provide valuable clinical data and a new tool that may aid in earlier diagnosis
of AD."
10763397,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a devastating illness in which traumatic autobiographical memories
are intrusive and lead to anxiety symptoms. These symptoms align with the functions of the default mode
network (DMN) and, in fact, PTSD patients have abnormalities within the DMN and in its interactions with other
networks, notably the salience network and the frontoparietal or central executive network. Focal repetitive
pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) enables neuromodulation of selected brain regions and
connected networks to treat specific symptoms, but the brain targets to support this therapy in PTSD are under
discovery. A recent analysis uncovered a brain circuit associated with improvement in anxiety and somatic
symptoms following the rTMS treatment of depression. The left hemisphere region with the strongest fMRI
functional connectivity with this circuit lies within anatomical area 8Av and the DMN. This association suggests
that modulating the DMN through stimulation at left 8Av could be a novel rTMS approach for the treatment of
anxiety and may help ameliorate anxiety symptoms in PTSD. This target would be novel since the vast majority
of clinical trials of rTMS in PTSD have targeted the right frontal regions of the salience and frontoparietal
networks instead of the DMN. One potential reason is that the most established nodes of the DMN do not lie
directly below the scalp/skull and are thus unreachable by rTMS. In this proposal we test the overall hypothesis
that left area 8Av can serve as a robust, direct brain target for the DMN thus facilitating therapy for PTSD and
the many other disorders involving the DMN. We propose to use TMS-fMRI in 30 Veterans with PTSD to test
the causal connections between left 8Av and other regions that could mediate a response. We will test the
connectivity between 8Av and the inferior parietal lobe (IPL), a region in the DMN involved in context
processing, and other nodes of the DMN (e.g., posterior cingulate, ventromedial prefrontal cortex). We have
pilot data in which we found the functional connection between 8Av and the IPL to be abnormal relative to
controls, and also that delivering rTMS to these regions ameliorates anxiety. We will also explore whether
stimulation at 8Av modulates the anterior insula, a node of the salience network whose functional connectivity
predicts benefit from prolonged exposure therapy in PTSD. We will measure the TMS induced BOLD response
in these areas to stimulation of 8Av and compare this response to conventional seed-based resting-state fMRI
functional connectivity analyses that could serve as an alternative marker for capacity for modulation. In
addition we will deliver thetaburst rTMS stimulation and study how connectivity changes with respect to
baseline. Our overall goal is to characterize left 8Av functional connectivity in PTSD, and explore the
effects of rTMS stimulation parameters. This project will thus provide a mechanistic understanding of
rTMS therapy at 8Av, and will reveal the effects of a novel connectivity-based atlas target."
10748410,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early-stage dementia (ED) have a significant impact on elderly patients’
quality of life, healthcare utilization, and cost. Despite nationwide efforts for timely diagnosis of MCI and ED
(MCI-ED), more than 50% of patients remained underdiagnosed and undertreated. This is mostly due to
patients’ inability to recognize early symptoms, limited availability of biomarkers, and clinicians’ insufficient time
to assess patients for MCI-ED, particularly for patients admitted to the home healthcare (HHC) setting. This
K99/R00 will address barriers to early identification of MCI-ED via the development of an innovative algorithm
built on a combination of multiple data streams, including data extracted from electronic health records (EHRs)
and audio-recorded patient-clinician verbal communication during routine encounters. Our primary goal is to
utilize the routinely generated data in the HHC setting, including OASIS (Outcome and Assessment
Information Set - a federally required assessment of patients admitted to HHC), HHC nurses’ notes, and HHC
patient-nurse verbal communication to develop an MCI-ED screening algorithm. The long-term training goal is
for Dr. Zolnoori to become an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to
mitigating the burden of delayed care for patients with MCI-ED by developing low-cost, effective informatics
solutions. The solutions will take advantage of easily accessible data generated in clinical encounters and will
be built on novel data science methods, particularly speech analysis, the focus of her postdoctoral work. Using
exceptional resources available from Columbia University and the Visiting Nurse Service of New York, the K99
phase of this project will focus on gaining essential competencies and skills in theory and practice of speech
analysis and cognitive impairment to quantify properties of MCI-ED patients’ verbal communications in
interactions with HHC nurses. The R00 phase will focus on the development of a screening algorithm for the
early identification of MCI-ED. The specific aims are to 1) model MCI-ED patients’ verbal communications with
HHC nurses using an automated speech analysis system; 2) utilize existing natural language processing
algorithms to automatically identify MCI-ED related information, including i) clinical symptoms, ii) lifestyle risk
factors, and iii) communication deficits from both HHC clinical notes and patient-nurse verbal communication;
and 3) develop a sensitive screening algorithm to identify HHC patients with MCI-ED. To accomplish the
research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in speech analysis,
cognitive impairment, HHC services, biostatistics, and career development mentorship has been assembled.
This project is significant because this algorithm will be built on easily accessible data streams generated
during routine patient-nurse encounters. The algorithm has a strong potential to be integrated into HHC clinical
workflow to raise clinician’s attention to the patient’s cognitive functioning for further evaluation and
development of proper interventions to reduce the risk of negative outcomes."
10930039,"Our collaborative groups, led by Drs. Price at UT Dallas (UTD), Dougherty at MD Anderson Cancer Center
(MDACC) and Curatolo at University of Washington (UW), have been on the forefront of using human dorsal
root ganglion (DRG) and other tissues to understand mechanisms that cause chronic pain in patients. Our work
is on the leading edge of transcriptomic studies that have revealed unique features of the human DRG at the
single neuron level. The goal of this project is to create the scientific foundation that will empower pain
researchers around the world to approach the problem of treating pain in a new way, deeply rooted in a
fundamental understanding of the first neurons and first synapses in the pain pathway. Our Center will focus on
two prioritized aims. The first is identifying molecular phenotypes, using single cell and spatial transcriptomic
technologies, of human sensory neurons from the DRG in organ donor recovered tissues and in patients suffering
from chronic pain who are having surgeries where DRGs or peripheral nerves are removed. We will use this
information to understand how nociceptors are activated in chronic pain disorders, with a focus on neuropathic
pain, chronic neck pain and low back pain. These chronic pain disorders are the most disabling and the latter
two are poorly modeled in animals. The second is to use spinal cord recovered from organ donors for single cell
and spatial profiling with the goal of understanding the connectome of the human pain pathway at the first
synapse. We will provide an integrated view of how nociceptors likely communicate with spinal cord neurons
with the goal of understanding the pharmacology of projection neurons that send nociceptive signals to the brain
to create pain perception. Our established collaboration and demonstrated track record of productivity ensures
the success of this complex project. We envision creating actionable knowledge and data resources that can
transform our understanding of human pain conditions leading to the generation of the treatments pain patients
need."
10865035,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dual use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes (i.e., dual use) is a common tobacco use pattern among adults in the
United States. The most common use for e-cigarettes among dual users is for harm reduction (i.e., the
complete transition to e-cigarettes or total cessation). Dual use may reduce the burden of tobacco use if it is a
temporary stage, i.e., cigarette smokers using e-cigarettes to quit, transition to e-cigarette use only, or total
cessation (i.e., harm reduction). However, this does not always translate in real life. A significant number of
dual users still maintain dual use, and evidence is mixed as to the effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a cessation
tool. Furthermore, dual users face barriers to and facilitators of harm reduction that are not clearly understood.
As such, we must understand these barriers/facilitators to develop effective interventions to help dual users
quit or reduce their harm. This study aims to identify these contextual and individual barriers that prevent dual
users from quitting cigarettes and the daily triggers associated with cigarette smoking and identify some
facilitators that may promote harm reduction. I will recruit two separate groups of adult users of e-cigarettes
and cigarettes (n= 50 each; 50% women; age ≥21years) to 1) use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in
a longitudinal within-subject study design to identify daily triggers and settings of cigarettes smoking for 14
days and 2) conduct focus group discussions to explore the contextual barriers/facilitators of harm reduction.
Combined, the proposed studies will give real-world evidence on the barriers that prevent adult dual users who
use e-cigarettes with the intent to quit but do not quit or reduce their harm. Though I have expertise in tobacco
research, I lack formal training in qualitative and EMA methodology. The mentoring team has outstanding
experience in epidemiological research of tobacco product use, qualitative methods, and EMA methodology
and is committed to supporting Dr. Osibogun in her training and professional development. Through this K01,
Dr. Osibogun will develop the skills to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independent researcher with
expertise in tobacco research, which will position her to develop and submit a R01 intervention grant proposal
that can leverage EMA and other techniques learned through the K01 training experience to improve cessation
outcomes among dual users."
10868471,"Abstract:
Despite the irreplaceable contributions of physician-scientists to clinical, the pipeline of clinician-scientist
trainees remains on the decline. A critical barrier to the physician-scientist career is the lack of protected time
and access to research mentorship available to physicians during clinical training. With the heightened acuity,
volume and complexities of modern medicine, clinical training has increasingly focused on the acquisition and
application of existing, rather than generation of new, knowledge. An unfortunate consequence of this shift in
focus is the increasing compartmentalization of scientific training into fragments of time that are inadequate to
provide the training and continuity needed to become proficient in the scientific investigation. The Tri-
Institutional Stimulating Access to Research during Residency (Tri-I StARR) program seeks to remedy this
deficiency by developing an integrated, longitudinal mentored research training program that will lead to the
development, implementation, and evaluation of new clinical interventions to prevent, diagnose, treat and
ameliorate health disparities of disorders of infectious, immunologic and inflammatory etiologies, with
mentorship from across Weill Cornell Medicine, Rockefeller University, and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Tri-I-
StARR will train residents on an integrated clinical-research pathway across 3 departments: Pediatrics,
Medicine, and Pathology in areas along the full biomedical research continuum and include the themes of
healthcare disparities and health and disease over the life course. The program proposes four training aims:
(1) Acquisition of skills in the scientific method and design of hypothesis-based projects to address human
diseases across the lifespan and their inequities, (2) Individualized, multidisciplinary mentorship in the design
and completion of a research project, (3) Development of short, intermediate, and long term IDPs that
integrate scientific and clinical training within and across career stages, and (4) Active engagement in
horizontal and vertical networking among physician-scientists within and across career stages and institutions.
The Tri-I-StARR will be led by an Executive Committee (EC) consisting of Kyu Rhee, MD PhD (Medicine),
Sallie Permar, MD, PhD (Pediatrics), and Ethel Cesarman, MD (Pathology), an Expanded Executive
Committee (EEC) of Residency Program Directors and Program Coordinators, and a team of 36 multi-
departmental, multi-disciplinary, well-funded, and experienced faculty preceptors. Three Resident-Investigators
each year will be supported for 12 months of research with the options to add an additional 12 months. Upon
completion, trainees will be capable of transitioning to research-intense fellowship training, successfully
competing for follow-on funding opportunities, including the K38, that will enable them to become the next
generation of physicians leading and mentoring trainees in clinically-oriented research. This program will fulfill
the urgent need for: 1) more full-time academic physician-researchers in medical schools throughout the
country, and 2) innovations and clinical translation of novel strategies to improve health across the lifespan."
10799629,"The p53 tumor suppressor is frequently inactivated by mutations in cancer. Most p53 point
mutations are located in the DNA binding domain that prevent folding or disrupt the DNA binding surface.
Rescuing the structural defect and transcriptional activity of mutant p53 in tumor cells should induce cell
death or cell cycle arrest that bring significant therapeutic benefits. However, this hypothesis remains
unproven because currently there are no specific drugs capable of efficiently reactivating mutant p53. To
bypass this limitation and rigorously test the clinical potential of mutant p53 functional rescue, we
established a procedure to induce sustained hypothermia in mice by pharmacological blockade of brain-
regulated thermogenesis. This mouse model enabled us to use hypothermia to reactivate temperature-
sensitive (ts) p53 mutants in tumors to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Preliminary experiments
demonstrated the ability of ts p53 activation in combination with chemotherapy to induce regression of
lymphoma xenografts. Importantly, durable remission was observed in a subset of tumors. This
promising finding provides proof-of-concept for mutant p53 functional rescue as a potential cancer
treatment. Furthermore, since ~14% of p53 point mutants in cancer are temperature-sensitive, our
results raised the possibility of using therapeutic hypothermia to treat tumors expressing ts mutant p53.
To explore the translational potential and molecular mechanism of this novel approach, we propose the
following specific aims: (1) Investigate tumor response to ts p53 activation and optimize therapeutic
efficacy. (2) Investigate the potential of ts mutant p53 in solid tumors and PDX models. (3)
Investigate the effect of endogenous ts p53 activation using a genetically engineered mouse
model. (4) Identify all p53 ts mutants with tumor suppressor activity in vivo by saturation screen.
These experiments will provide proof-of-concept for specific targeting of tumors expressing ts mutant
p53, with the potential to impact a large number of cancer patients."
10807012,"Project Summary
 Metastatic melanoma, a cancer derived from pigment-producing melanocytes, is the deadliest type of skin
cancer. Metastatic melanoma that is refractory or resistant to current therapies has a poor prognosis. Melanoma
growth and therapy resistance is dependent on dysregulated gene expression, and gene expression in
melanoma remains poorly understood. The transcriptional cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) are a
phylogenetically distinct group of kinases that directly regulate transcriptional subprocesses. I found that CDK13
is mutated in melanoma; these mutations are kinase-dead and act by interfering with WT CDK13 function
(dominant negative). Downregulation or mutation in CDK13 is associated with poor prognosis in metastatic
melanoma patients, expression of mutant CDK13 in a zebrafish model expedites melanoma onset, and
expression of mutant CDK13 in human melanoma cells causes the cells to be more proliferative. Mutant CDK13
fails to phosphorylate a protein that activates nuclear degradation of prematurely truncated ‘junk’ RNAs
(ptRNAs). Subsequently, ptRNAs accumulate, are exported to the cytoplasm, and are translated into short
proteins. This work is newly published on BioRxiv. I have also recently identified recurrent truncations in two
nuclear RNA surveillance members: ZFC3H1 and ZC3H18. Here, I propose to further investigate the mechanism
of mutant-CDK13 oncogenesis and nuclear RNA surveillance in melanoma. In Aim1, I plan to a) determine how
protein stress pathways are affected in CDK13-mutant cells and b) to test whether truncated protein expression
is sufficient to recapitulate the CDK13-mutant phenotype in zebrafish melanoma. In Aim 2, I will investigate
whether recurrent truncating mutations in two nuclear surveillance complex members (ZFC3H1 and/or ZC3H18)
cause more aggressive melanoma and if so, how nuclear RNA surveillance is impacted using proteomics and 3’
transcriptomics. This work has the potential to open a new cancer biology field and to lead to therapeutic
strategies for cancers with deficient nuclear RNA surveillance.
 This research will be conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Leonard Zon, a renowned hematologist/oncologist

10817221,"Maternal hyperglycemia including Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) disproportionately affects 5-11% of
African American Pregnant Women (AAPW). GDM and even nondiabetic hyperglycemia are linked to
preeclampsia, primary cesarean section, macrosomia, birth trauma in the short-term, and increased risks of
obesity, Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in mothers and offspring in the long-term. National medical
costs of GDM even for short-term consequences are high at $1.8 billion yearly. Overweight/obese AAPW have
the highest increased risk of GDM, GDM recurrence and nondiabetic hyperglycemia of any race. Sleep
disparities also exist. AAPW have shorter sleep, later midpoints of sleep (timing), worse sleep continuity and
quality than White women. We and others have shown short sleep duration, poor sleep quality and later sleep
timing are associated with increased GDM risk. Sleep disturbances, ubiquitous in pregnancy, may represent
MODIFIABLE risk factors for maternal hyperglycemia. While cognitive/behavioral methods have yielded robust
improvement in sleep duration and quality in general population, we are the only group to test the effects of a
nonpharmacologic sleep intervention to improve maternal glucose metabolism in AAPW. Our preliminary work
suggests that sleep B.E.T.T.E.R. addressing 6 principles of wake-sleep hygiene (Bedroom, Exercise, Tension,
Time in bed, Eating, and Rhythm), targeting 24-hr behaviors and multiple lifestyle components can successfully
improve sleep in pregnant women. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to establish the
effectiveness of our culturally targeted and individually tailored BETTER intervention to promote maternal
glucose metabolism in AAPW. We will enroll 150 overweight/obese nulliparous AAPW aged 18-40. They will be
randomized (75 per group) to: 1) sleep BETTER or 2) attention control (Birth-Prep). Data will be collected at 16-
20 (baseline), 28-30 (end of treatment) and 34-36 (post treatment) gestational weeks (GWs) using valid and
reliable instruments monitoring sleep in free-living conditions with state-of-the-art methods assessing glucose
levels and insulin sensitivity. Our specific aims are to: (1) Define the impact of BETTER versus Birth-Prep on
glucose tolerance (fasting glucose-primary outcome) and insulin sensitivity, and (2) Determine the efficacy of
BETTER versus Birth-Prep to improve sleep duration, sleep quality and timing in participants, and (3) Determine
the extent to which other factors represent key effect modifiers including economic hardships, psychosocial
stress and racial discrimination for the intervention (exploratory aim). The long-term goals of our research are
1) to develop low-cost and effective approach on optimizing maternal metabolism and well-being that can be
easily employed in prenatal care from hospital- or community-based clinics, and 2) to integrate sleep hygiene
principles in mainstream prenatal education to improve maternal glucose metabolism in low income African
American women. This can contribute to better health outcomes in mothers, their offspring and next generations.
This proposal supports NIMHD’s mission of improving minority health and eliminating health disparities."
10820495,"Project Summary/Abstract
Emergence of multidrug and extensively drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria is a growing problem that threatens
established antimicrobial treatment protocols. Acinetobacter baumannii is an emerging critical threat pathogen
notorious for its ability to rapidly develop intrinsic multidrug resistance. A. baumannii causes hospital-acquired
infections, which manifest as bacteremia, urinary tract and wound infections. In the US, an estimated 60% of
hospital-acquired A. baumannii infections were multidrug resistant, often including carbapenem resistance, which
leaves colistin as the “last-resort” treatment option. However, colistin resistance has also emerged. There is an
urgent need to understand intrinsic mechanisms that promote antibiotic resistance phenotypes in A. baumannii to
guide alternative antimicrobial strategies. Our preliminary work has identified factors that promote acquisition of
multidrug resistance, including carbapenem and colistin resistance, in A. baumannii. Specifically, links between the
outer membrane and peptidoglycan layers of the cell envelope are key for the resistance phenotypes, where one
layer compensates for defects in the other. While enzymes that assemble the outer membrane and cell wall are
largely known, A. baumannii encodes unique regulatory mechanisms to control their activity in response to stress.
In this proposal, we will address three important questions to understand intrinsic antibiotic resistance in A.
baumannii. The questions will explore the relationship between peptidoglycan and outer membrane assembly, which
is poorly understood in Gram-negative bacteria. Findings from this work will enable us to build a model of intrinsic
factors in A. baumannii that lead to multidrug resistance and will help in the design of combinatorial drug regimens
that target both essential layers, thus precluding resistance; consequently, our findings support the National
Institute of Health mission, which aims to foster fundamental discoveries to reduce human disease."
10837825,"Abnormally phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (p-tau) is one of the diagnostic hallmarks of AD
pathologies, which strongly correlates with synaptic loss and cognitive decline in AD. Tau pathology first
appears in the transentorhinal cortex and entorhinal cortex layer II (EC II), then spreads to the Cornu Ammonis
1 (CA1) field of the hippocampal region at the prodromal stage of AD (Braak stage I-II). However, no animal
model has ever succeeded in showing tau propagation from EC II specific to CA1 as typically seen in the early
Braak staging. A recent study has discovered that Wolfram syndrome-1 (Wfs1) positive cells in EC II project to
CA1 via the stratum lacunosum moleculare along the temporammonic (TA) pathway. We hypothesize that
misfolded tau propagates from Wfs1+ cells in EC II to CA1 via the TA pathway, and that the TA pathway is a
novel therapeutic target to suppress tau propagation in the prodromal AD stage. Our exciting preliminary data
showed that the stereotaxic injection of adeno-associated virus expressing Cre-inducible P301L tau into EC II
of Wfs1-Cre mice induced: 1) robust human tau transfer from EC II to CA1 pyramidal neurons, 2) direct tau
transfer between axonal terminals of Wfs1+ EC II neurons and dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, 3)
suppression of excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons, and 4) impaired associative working memory. Thus, this
new mouse model may recapitulate tau pathology progression from Braak I to II, and develop
neurophysiological dysfunction and hippocampal learning impairment. The object of this current application
is to fully characterize the pathology of this EC II-CA1 tau propagation mouse model and delineate the
connectivity and mode of tau transmission from EC II to CA1. Our overarching goal is to invent therapeutics
for prodromal AD using this mouse model. In Aim 1, we will i) characterize the post-translational modification of
tau and cell types in EC II-CA1 mice using multiple p-tau antibodies and neuronal specific markers. ii) Validate
the translatability of the findings in human AD brain tissues using early Braak stage and age/sex matched
control specimens.iii) Investigate the gene expression profiles in EC, CA1, and prefrontal cortical regions of
male and female mice to understand the molecular basis of sexual dimorphism in the behavioral outcome. In
Aim 2, we will i) employ immuno-electron microscopy and super-resolution confocal microscopic imaging to
capture tau transfer between EC II axonal terminals and radial dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons;ii) explore
monosynaptic tracing between CA1 pyramidal cells and EC II neurons using Cre-dependent complementation
of a modified rabies virus and WGA-GFP reporter system, and iii) determine the effect of activating/inhibiting
neuronal firing on tau propagation, the role of neuronal extracellular vesicle release, and LDL Receptor Related
Protein 1 as the predicted receptor for free tau secreted from the synaptic terminals. The proposed research
project will develop a new understanding of tau propagation mechanism seen in the early Braak stages and
provide a new insight for the sexual dimorphism in cognitive phenotype."
10833516,"Project Summary/Abstract
Intracellular cargo transport, such as lipid-bound insulin granules and presynaptic vesicles that are destined for
secretion at the plasma membrane, rely on the concerted effort of kinesin-1 (kin1) and myosin Va (myoVa)
molecular motors. These double-headed molecular motors carry their common cargo by stepping processively
for considerable distances along their respective cytoskeletal tracks, i.e. microtubules (MTs) for kin1 and actin
filaments for myoVa. To successfully deliver cargo, teams of kin1 and myoVa motors on the cargo surface,
must overcome the physical challenges presented by the 3-dimensional (3D) complex network of MTs and
actin filaments that comprise the cell’s cytoskeleton, which also serves as these motors’ highways. To
determine how efficient intracellular cargo transport and delivery are accomplished despite the physical
challenges presented by the cell’s complex cytoskeletal highway, we have developed a near-physiological in
vitro model system of kin1 and myoVa transport that is composed of a complex, but well-defined, 3-
dimensional (3D), MT and actin filament network. Physiologically-relevant lipid-bound liposomes will be formed
having Rab receptor proteins embedded in the liposome membranes so that molecular motors can be linked to
the Rab receptors through their respective adapter proteins as in vivo. Once formed, motor-coated liposomes
are introduced into the 3D networks and their transport trajectories defined using state-of-the-art single
molecule biophysical techniques with high spatial and temporal resolution. Track-binding proteins to MTs
(MAP7, Tau) and actin filaments (tropomyosins) will be added to dictate the direction of liposome transport.
Key questions to be addressed using this well-defined model system are: 1) How are motors loaded onto the
cargo surface? 2) Are motors on the cargo surface that are not engaged in transport, passive hitchhikers or are
they cargo tethers that electrostatically interact with the heterologous track to enhance cargo transport by the
actively engaged motors? 3) Is cargo hand-off from MT- to actin-based transport a coordinated event or the
result of a tug of war? 4) Do track-binding proteins help to sort cargo by enhancing or inhibiting transport on
specific MT and actin filaments? To interpret the results of these experiments, we will develop a mechanistic in
silico transport model that incorporates the mechanical interactions between motor teams on the liposome
surface. We propose that a functional interplay exists between the properties of the cytoskeletal tracks, motors,
and cargos, which determines how teams of molecular motors meet the cellular demands placed on them by
3D cytoskeletal highways. The data obtained will provide a rich, mechano-spatial knowledgebase for the field
and serve as a foundation for understanding molecular motor transport in the complex cytoarchitectural
environment of the cell and how efficient motor transport systems are designed for delivery and retention of
cargo at its destination."

A diverse oral health care workforce of both clinicians and researchers has been repeatedly called for.
The absence of such diversity and its relationship to oral health disparities has been recognized as a
persistent problem. Further, “the NIH recognizes that achieving diversity in the biomedical research
workforce is critical to the full realization of our national research goals and is the best interest of our
country”. The long-term goal is a sustainable summer research education program, Research Education
in Oral Health Sciences (REOHs), that stimulates trainees and provides mentorship support for students
to pursue future training opportunities in oral health research. The overall objectives in this application
are to (i) encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds to pursue further studies or careers in oral
health research; and (ii) foster a better understanding of biomedical, behavioral and clinical research and
its implications. The rationale for this proposed program is that early exposure increases interest and
consideration of health science careers. The overall objectives will be pursued through three specific
aims: 1) Develop, implement, and evaluate, and sustain a 9-week comprehensive summer program that
provides hands-on exposure to research and supports participants’ scientific and career development; 2)
Recruit, enroll and retain a cohort of 8-10 high school and undergraduate student participants, annually,
that are underrepresented in the biomedical sciences and oral health professions; and 3) Evaluate the
effectiveness of the REOHS program. The proposed program will emphasize translational science
principles and education of social determinants of health. Ultimately, the proposed summer research
education program, REOHS, has the potential to enhance the training of an oral health workforce to meet
the nation’s biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs."
10738793,"Rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among military personnel have surged in recent years. In
response, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has launched nationwide training initiatives to disseminate
two PTSD treatments with strong empirical support: prolonged exposure (PE) therapy and cognitive processing
therapy (CPT). Despite the well-documented effectiveness of PE and CPT, only a minority of Veterans with
PTSD initiate these trauma-focused treatments. One approach to addressing PTSD in a non-trauma focused
fashion is to utilize empirically supported treatments focused on safety aid reduction. Safety aids are
maladaptive cognitive and/or behavioral strategies designed to prevent, avoid, or alleviate anxiety. Initially
introduced as a way to explain how pathological anxiety can persist despite repeated exposure to feared
stimuli, safety aids have been found to play a critical role in the etiology and maintenance of various anxiety
and related conditions including PTSD. Importantly, a separate line of research suggests that safety aids are
amenable to change through cognitive behavioral interventions. While promising, these trials did not include
patients with PTSD. In this context, the purpose of the proposed Clinical Science Research and Development
(CSR&D) Career Development Award-2 (CDA-2) is to adapt and extend an existing safety aid reduction
treatment protocol for use among Veterans with PTSD. This treatment protocol, termed Safety Aid Reduction
Treatment for PTSD (START-PTSD), will then be evaluated for acceptability and feasibility, prior to testing the
efficacy compared to a wait-list control. Participants will include individuals with a diagnosis of PTSD who
decline to participate in evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) for PTSD, namely PE or CPT."
10827868,"Project Summary/Abstract
The main goal of these studies is to discover novel ways to prevent chemotherapy-related intestinal injury. Dox-
orubicin is a chemotherapy drug administered to treat metastatic cancers in patients and is commonly used to
model intestinal injury in mice. Chemotherapy has many off target side effects, including the inflammation of
mucus membranes termed mucositis. Patients commonly present with pain, vomiting and diarrhea causing high
morbidity. Worsening symptoms reduce patient adherence to treatment and limit physician administration of
therapeutic chemotherapy doses. There are no effective therapies to attenuate mucositis, and despite the need,
there is limited research on intestinal mucositis. Intestinal stem cell (ISC) damage is a common feature of murine
intestinal mucosal damage by various insults. Pathways related to the regenerative process of the intestine in-
clude those that drive cellular remodeling, such as autophagy. Fasting prior to doxorubicin chemotherapy ad-
ministration in mice has been shown to protect intestinal stem cells from DNA damage by activating autophagy.
Furthermore, terminally differentiated Paneth cells (PCs) are resistant to injury and can de-differentiate to help
reestablish the integrity of the intestinal epithelium. While the early cellular reconstructive mechanisms that
allow post-mitotic PCs to revert to an ISC state are relatively unknown, insights can be extrapolated from the
acquired plasticity of other terminally differentiated cell types. Notably, the early activation of autophagy is an
essential step in the reprograming of terminally differentiated fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells invitro.
These findings highlight the importance of autophagy in the protection from injury, and the recovery from injury
when protection is not possible. Aim 1 of this proposal will elucidate the role of autophagy in the protection
against doxorubicin-induced intestinal mucosal damage. First, rapamycin, an autophagy inducing drug, will be
administered to mice to determine if the protective effects of fasting can be emulated by the stimulation of au-
tophagy alone. To enhance the translatability of these findings the effect of fasting/autophagy on intestinal injury
and tumor responsiveness will be examined in a doxorubicin-sensitive metastatic cancer model. Aim 2 will ex-
amine the role of autophagy in PC-mediated intestinal regeneration following injury. Two PC-specific genetically
modified mouse models will be generated to determine if autophagy is required for PC-mediated intestinal re-
generation. The long-term goal of this project is to produce generalizable breakthroughs that have broader im-
plications for the gamut of GI medical conditions that result from epithelial damage. All experiments will be
conducted at Baylor College of Medicine, with the assistance of numerous core facilities with state-of-the-art
equipment and technology. This project is strong vehicle for physician scientist training and will foster profi-
ciency in technique, critical thinking, communication and mentorship."

Now in its 13th year, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium is perhaps the most innovative and productive
experiment in the history of psychiatry. The PGC unified the field and attracted a cadre of outstanding
scientists (802 investigators from 157 institutions in 41 countries). PGC work has led to identification of ~500
genetic loci in the 11 psychiatric disorders we study. Our work has led to 320 papers, many in high-profile
journals (Nature 3, Cell 5, Science 2, Nat Genet 27, Nat Neurosci 9, Mol Psych 37, Biol Psych 25). As
summary statistics are freely available, psychiatric disorders often feature prominently in papers by non-PGC
investigators. To advance discovery and impact, we propose to continue the work of the PGC across 11
disorder groups. Considerable new data are coming in the next five years. We thus can rapidly and efficiently
increase our knowledge of the fundamental basis of major psychiatric disorders.
Aim 1: we will continue to advance genetic discovery for severe psychiatric disorders in all working groups,
systematically interface with large biobank studies to ensure maximal comparability, and aggressively promote
new studies of individuals with psychiatric disorders from diverse ancestries to increase discovery and improve
fine-mapping. Aim 2: most studies analyze common variation (Aim 1), rare CNV (Aim 2), and rare
exome/genome resequencing results (via collaboration) in isolation: we will apply an integrative framework to
rigorously evaluate the contributions of all measured types of genetic variation on risk for psychiatric disorders.
Aim 3: we will move beyond classical case-control definitions to a more biologically-based and nuanced
understanding by enabling large trans-diagnostic studies, convene trans-disciplinary teams to use genetics to
address unresolved questions about the nature of psychiatric disorders, and to promote large studies of the
severest cases seen in psychiatric practice (leveraging the global reach of PGC investigators). Aim 4: we will
work to maximize the impact of our work via translational efforts: close collaborations with neuroscience
consortia to understand the biological implications of our findings; work to identify modifiable causal risk
factors; and work to robustly predict clinical outcomes and identify patient subsets. Aim 5: we will increase
impact of our work by extending and formalizing outreach to different communities (including pharma and
biotech), via digital media (Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia), and by developing, distributing, and updating
resources/educational material for patients, families, and medical professionals. We will convene a Scientific
Advisory Board to ensure we respond positively to those invested in our results
Successful completion of this body of work will greatly advance knowledge of the genetic basis of psychiatric
disorders with potentially major nosological and treatment implications. These goals are consistent with a core
mission of the NIMH, and the central idea of the PGC: to convert the family history risk factor into biologically,
clinically, and therapeutically meaningful insights."
10805105,"Project Summary/Abstract: Small-vessel-related vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia
(VCID) represent the second leading cause of cognitive dysfunction in older individuals. However, quantitative
measures indexing key vascular processes related to VCID that are suitable for use as diagnostic biomarkers
or endpoints in clinical trials are still lacking. In particular, biomarkers are playing an increasingly important role
in biological/etiological classification of patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD),
following the development of the “A/T/N” classification system. However, the current “A/T/N” scheme is only
applicable to dementia of AD type. Therefore, the development of a biomarker to extend the “A/T/N”
classification scheme to “A/T/N/V” is of potentially high impact.
 Cerebral physiological parameters can report key process leading to the pathological cascade in the brain
and usually occur early in disease. Drugs that can alter physiological process such as perfusion are also
readily available. Therefore, a physiology-based biomarker in VCID will have a major impact on the diagnosis
and treatment selection/monitoring of patients with vascular cognitive impairment, vascular dementia, or mixed
dementia which are common in ADRD. The PI’s lab recently pioneered a non-invasive MRI technique to
measure the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) of the brain, a parameter indexing the balance between
oxygen supply and consumption, with a scan time of merely one and a half minutes. Our preliminary studies
provided strong evidence that elevated OEF is a physiological hallmark of VCID and tracks the progression of
vascular risks and the growth in white-matter-hyperintensity (WMH) volume. Therefore, the central hypothesis
of this project is that OEF is a sensitive and practical marker in classifying “V” in the A/T/N/V system.
 This project has three Aims. Aim 1 will examine the cross-sectional relationship of OEF with vascular
abnormalities on MRI, cognitive function, and clinical diagnosis in a VCID-enriched cohort. Our novel cohort
will consist of impaired patients (subjective cognitive decline, MCI, and mild dementia) with MRI-confirmed
small vessel abnormalities such as WMH, microbleeds, or lacunar infarcts. Aim 2 will be a longitudinal study
(30-month follow-up) of these participants. Changes in OEF will be studied along with their relationship with
changes in cognitive function and vascular abnormalities. Baseline OEF will also be investigated to examine if
it can predict changes in clinical and cognitive scores. Aim 3 will operationalize the OEF marker to make it
ready for use in clinical/research studies. We will also consider the relationship of OEF with other markers
being tested in the field such as the MarkVCID Study. The PI has assembled an outstanding team of multi-
disciplinary investigators for this project and all of them have worked together previously."
10588597,"Low-dose methotrexate (MTX) is first-line therapy for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis or
skin disease, but as many as 50-70% of patients do not adequately respond to MTX. A study of the Veterans
Affairs Rheumatoid Arthritis registry demonstrated that the mortality rate among veterans with RA is more than
double the rate of those without RA, which highlights the need for adequate treatment in this population.
Modifying factors that limit MTX response would enable more patients to benefit from this anchor drug that
synergistically increases the efficacy of other immunomodulatory medications. We recently showed that the gut
microbiome of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients predicts MTX responsiveness, raising the possibility that gut
microbiota contributes to MTX response. Unexpectedly, we found that MTX, originally designed to inhibit human
folate enzymes, exerts growth-inhibitory effects on gut microbiota, and transplantation of MTX-exposed
microbiotas into gnotobiotic mice led to decreased immune activation. Our findings suggest that one mechanism
by which MTX exerts its anti-inflammatory effects is via modulation of the gut microbiota. Thus, the gut
microbiome may be a modifiable factor that can be targeted to enable more patients to benefit from MTX.
 There is, therefore, a critical need to identify microbial genes responsible for sensitivity to MTX and
mechanisms by which MTX affects the microbiota to shape host immunity to determine how to enhance MTX
response in the host. This information can enable us to potentially modify the microbiota and better target MTX
therapy to advance precision medicine for RA patients. The long-term goal of our lab is to identify the molecular
mechanisms by which the human gut microbiome impacts the treatment of rheumatic and autoimmune diseases
and determine how modulation of the microbiome can enhance therapeutic responses.
 The overall objectives of this application are to (i) identify microbial genes that determine the sensitivity
of microbiota to MTX and (ii) and evaluate the mechanisms by which MTX acts on microbes to affect host
immunity. We will test the hypothesis that targeting bacterial pathways involved in antibiotic resistance and folate
metabolism can increase bacterial sensitivity to MTX, leading to increased extracellular adenosine and reduced
inflammation in the host. The rationale is that identifying these mechanistic links is critical to determine a scientific
framework for development of microbiota-targeted therapies to improve patient response to MTX. Using an
innovative combination of microbial genetics and genomics, bacterially targeted drug therapies, gnotobiotic
mouse models, and studies of patient-derived microbiotas, we first aim to (1) identify genetic determinants of
MTX sensitivity in bacteria, and (2) decipher mechanisms of immunomodulation by MTX-altered bacteria. This
project is significant because MTX non-response affects a majority of those tried on MTX. This project is
innovative because it systematically probes drug-microbiota interactions to determine contributions to MTX
response in the host. The results from these studies are critical to lay the foundation for the development of
microbially-directed therapies to improve MTX response, potentially enabling a greater number of patients to
benefit from an anchor drug in rheumatology."

This project is submitted under NIH Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant Program Number: PA-
20-195. Mitragyna speciosa Korth., commonly known as kratom, is a tree native to Southeast Asia. The leaves
of kratom and its commercially available products are self-prescribed to treat pain, enhance mood, and mitigate
opioid withdrawal symptoms. According to reports, there are more than 15 million kratom consumers in the
United States, including childbearing age females. Women with a history of opioid intake consume kratom to
treat their pain and opioid withdrawal symptoms during pregnancy with a belief that herbal replacement of
traditional opioids will be safer for their child. According to published case reports and discussions with neonatal
medicine specialists, exposure to kratom may affect fetal development and opioid withdrawal symptoms have
been observed in neonates. However, most mothers that consume kratom during pregnancy have a history of
illicit substance intake and there is no clear scientific evidence if kratom can be directly connected to withdrawal
symptoms in newborns. There is an urgent need to understand if kratom alkaloids can cross the placental barrier
and lead to serious withdrawal symptoms in newborns. We believe it is important to assess the in utero effects
of not only mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, but also the traditional kratom preparation (as a lyophilized
tea) and a commercially used product (OPMS Gold). In rats, we will establish the fetal exposure and metabolism
of mitragynine and metabolites along with other major kratom alkaloids. We can simultaneously quantify eleven
kratom alkaloids and/or mitragynine along with its three major metabolites in biological matrices. In a
pharmacokinetic-based Specific Aim 1, we will establish the fetal exposure of kratom alkaloids after oral doses
of mitragynine, lyophilized tea and commercially used product (OPMS Gold). We will check the systemic
excretion of mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine and other kratom alkaloids through fetal urine by analyzing the
amniotic fluid. We will establish a multi-compartmental pharmacokinetic model to describe the concentration-
time data for mothers and fetuses. In a pharmacodynamic-based Specific Aim 2, we will test if in utero exposure
of kratom alkaloids leads to withdrawal symptoms in newborns. We will evaluate naltrexone precipitated opioid
withdrawal symptoms in pups immediately after birth. We will also perform immunohistochemistry studies for
withdrawal-specific biomarkers (NR2B, Arc, GFAP and C-fos). After 2 years, we will establish a direct relationship
between kratom intake during pregnancy and its consequences on newborns. If deemed reasonable, a blanket
warning can be issued to stop the use of kratom during the gestation period and further studies will be performed
to evaluate the effect of in utero exposure of kratom on long-term memory and learning capacity of progeny."
10758614,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is caused by BCR-ABL1, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase generated from
the Philadelphia chromosome. In the chronic phase of CML (CP-CML), myeloid cells are expanded, but maintain
terminal differentiation. Most CP-CML patients achieve durable responses to BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs), and their extended survival is reflected by a steep rise in CML prevalence. Unfortunately, TKIs
fail to eliminate quiescent CML stem cells (LSCs) whose survival is independent of BCR-ABL1, necessitating
lifelong TKI therapy to prevent CML recurrence. In 5-10% of patients, a differentiation block converts CP-CML
into blast phase CML (BP-CML), an aggressive acute leukemia that is often BCR-ABL1-independent and TKI
resistant. Our overarching hypothesis is that blocked differentiation is central to the BCR-ABL1 independence
that characterizes the extremes of the clinical CML spectrum: Persistence of residual leukemia despite TKI
therapy and TKI-resistant BP-CML. We have discovered that expression of MS4A3, a member of the MS4A
(membrane-spanning four A) family of signaling proteins, is profoundly reduced in quiescent, TKI resistant and
BP CML cells, and that low MS4A3 correlates with shorter survival. MS4A3 knockdown (KD) in CML CD34+ cells
inhibits myeloid differentiation, and promotes TKI resistance, while ectopic MS4A3 expression has opposite
effects (Zhao et al. Blood. 2021;Epub ahead of print. PMID: 34780648). Our preliminary data suggest that MS4A3
promotes IL-3 and GM-CSF signaling in CML CD34+ cells by promoting endocytosis of their cognate β common
chain (βc) receptors. We hypothesize that MS4A3 promotes myeloid differentiation by enhancing response to βc
cytokines in leukemic stem and progenitor cells (LSPCs). TKI resistant CML cells downregulate MS4A3 to blunt
response to differentiation-inducing cytokines, thereby maintaining a primitive, therapy-resistant state. Re-
establishment of MS4A3 expression will enforce differentiation and enhance drug sensitivity. In Aim 1, we will
delineate how MS4A3 regulates endocytosis and signaling of βc cytokine receptors. We will track endocytosis
by high-throughput immunofluorescent and confocal live cell imaging, identify MS4A3 cofactors by mass
spectrometry, and MS4A3-regulated signaling pathways by reverse phase protein array. In Aim 2, we will
determine the function of MS4A3 in normal hematopoiesis. We will generate mouse strains with hematopoietic-
specific conditional Ms4a3 knockout or inducible overexpression and characterize their hematopoietic system at
steady state and under stress. In Aim 3, we will delineate the role of MS4A3 in CML hematopoiesis and as a
therapeutic agent in CML. We will test whether modulating MS4A3 expression in LSPCs affects leukemogenesis
and TKI response, and whether MS4A3-loaded nanoparticles attenuate BP-CML in xenografts. If successful, we
will establish MS4A3 as a novel master regulator of βc cytokine signaling that governs signal strength by
modulating endocytosis. BP-CML remains mostly incurable, and most CP-CML patients require lifelong TKI
therapy. Our work may provide proof of concept for using forced MS4A3 expression to overcome TKI resistance."
10788411,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Nearly half of the U.S. population sometimes or always experiences loneliness.
This is alarming, in part, because loneliness confers risk for negative mental and physical health outcomes.
Extensive research suggests loneliness is characterized by subjective isolation: many lonely individuals maintain
a number of relationships but still report feeling lonely. Thus, a neurobiological account of loneliness requires
that we understand how the brain represents our subjective connections to others and how loneliness alters
these representations. The long-term goal of this proposal is to identify how subjective isolation is represented
in the brain in order to identify novel ways to intervene on this representation to attenuate loneliness. We propose
that medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and posterior cingulate (PC), which comprise a functional network in the
brain, organize our representations of people based on our subjective connection to them and that loneliness
systematically alters this organization. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine whether subjective closeness
organizes self and other representations in MPFC/PC. While undergoing fMRI, participants will complete tasks
in which they reflect on their own and other people’s personalities and mental states. They will also report on
their subjective closeness, similarity, and familiarity to the other people. Representational similarity analysis
(RSA) will test 1) whether the brain organizes mental representations of the self and one’s own social network
members based on subjective closeness and 2) whether the subjective closeness model better explains the
organization of self and other representations than the alternative possibilities of perceived similarity, familiarity,
or trait-dimensions. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine how loneliness modulates self and other representations
in MPFC/PC. We predict that trait loneliness corresponds with MPFC/PC patterns reflecting 1) greater
differentiation between self and others and/or 2) less differentiation between close others and acquaintances.
Individual difference measures that are related, but non-redundant, with loneliness (i.e., self-esteem, depression)
will also be collected to isolate the specificity of our findings to loneliness. In Specific, Exploratory Aim 3, we will
determine the cognitive consequences of altered self and other representation in loneliness. Participants will
also complete fMRI tasks designed to test novel hypotheses generated by our pilot data regarding the
neurocognitive processes altered by loneliness. Participants will be asked to judge the interpersonal closeness
and similarity in personalities between self and social network members. We predict that loneliness will be
associated with exaggerating the difference between self and other personalities while also overgeneralizing the

10798144,"Signal transduction pathways function in interconnected networks comprising
common or shared proteins. How specific signals are directed through a common
protein module to induce a highly specific response is not clear. Some diseases like
cancer can arise because a signal that is meant to follow one path is misdirected into
another. One MAPK pathway in yeast regulates a microbial differentiation response
called filamentous growth. In fungal pathogens, filamentous growth is required for
virulence. The MAPK pathway is composed of G proteins and protein kinases that
function in multiple pathways. A major regulator of the pathway is the Rho GTPase,
Cdc42, which is widely considered a master regulator of cell polarity and signaling.
In this proposal is reported the discovery that Cdc42 is degraded by a mechanism
that involves ubiquitin modification of the protein. This discovery is important
because it provides a new way to regulate signaling pathways that require Cdc42 for
function. Thus, one objective of the proposal is to determine the functional
consequences of Cdc42 turnover on MAP kinase signaling (Aim 1). In addition to
Cdc42, several protein kinases are shared among MAPK pathways. In Aim 2, a
newly identified scaffold of the Ral GDS type will be examined that binds to kinases
to direct them to the MAPK pathway. The filamentous growth pathway is regulated
by a sensor protein of the mucin family. Mucins are large glycoproteins that regulate
signaling pathways through mechanisms that remain uclear. In Aim 3 of the
proposal, how the mucin connects to and regulates Cdc42 will be determined. One
candidate is the cell's main polairty scaffold, which has recently been found to also
regulate the MAPK pathway. Experiments are proposed to determine how the mucin
directs the polarity scaffold to the Cdc42 module. Collectively, this proposal will
define new mechanisms of G protein regulation, as well as how commom proteins
are directed to specific pathways. Given that the proteins in this pathway are highly
conserved from yeast to humans, insights gained from this proposal will likely extend
to signaling pathways in general, including those that are relevant to human health.

10800735,"PROJECT SUMMARY
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2018, there were an estimated 405 000 deaths from
malaria. Children aged under 5 years are the most vulnerable group affected by malaria and accounted for 67%
(272 000) of all malaria deaths worldwide. The WHO African Region was home to the highest number of
malaria deaths in with 94% of all malaria deaths in 2018. In regions with highly seasonal malaria transmission,
several studies have shown a sharp decline in malaria infections through the use of intermittent preventive
treatment pregnant women and young children between the ages of three and fifty-nine months. Seasonal
malaria chemoprevention (SMC) in these young children consists of treatment courses of sulfadoxine–
pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine given at monthly intervals during the malaria season to maintain therapeutic
anti-malarial drug concentrations in the blood throughout the period of greatest malaria risk. Despite the
substantial benefits provided by SMC, one concern is that SMC will impair the acquisition of protective
immune responses, thereby increasing the risk of disease in later years. Studies have shown changes in the ages
of peak susceptibility to malaria, with older children more vulnerable to disease following the implementation
of control strategies. In 2016, SMC was implemented nationwide in Mali. This project will measure the age-
specific incidence of malaria in children in Bandiagara, a rural town in central Mali that has been a malaria field
research site for two decades. This will include three age groups: 0-4 years (representing the targeted group for
SMC), 5-10 years (a “mixed” group of children who received SMC and older ones who did not) and 11-18
years (no history of SMC). We will compare the incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic malaria to that
measured in similar strata before the implementation of seasonal malaria chemoprevention in the community.
Using custom protein microarrays, we will compare the antibody responses to malaria antigens by age group
before and with SMC implementation. We will identify and map the spatial distribution of parasite reservoirs
(including both symptomatic and asymptomatic parasite carriage) using ultra-sensitive molecular testing and
define asymptomatic parasite carrier hotspots, particularly in the dry season (January to May). The dry season is
of particular interest because during this period, parasite carriage (symptomatic or asymptomatic carriage) and
transmission (gametocyte carriage) are very low, and the human reservoir of parasites is significantly reduced.
The dry season is thus a critical temporal window of opportunity to eliminate malaria. The results of this study
will define the consequences of SMC in pediatric populations in Mali and identify parasite reservoirs, helping to
shape new approaches for future malaria control strategies, including treating populations with high
asymptomatic carriage and targeting mosquito populations in defined hotspots."

 Allergic rhinitis is the most common mucosal allergy. Its cardinal symptoms include excessive sneezing
and rhinorrhea, which severely impact our life quality and productivity. Although antihistamines effectively
relieved sneezing induced by intermittent mild allergic rhinitis, they are ineffective against persistent
moderate/severe allergic rhinitis. The development of new drugs for alleviating allergic sneezing is hindered by
a lack of information about the principal nasal sensory neurons that mediate sneezing and their interactions with
immune cells. In this proposal, we hypothesize that a highly restricted population of nasal sensory neurons
defined by the expression of MrgprC11 detect mast cell mediators in allergic rhinitis and trigger the sneezing
reflex. In Aim 1, we will characterize the innervation pattern of MrgprC11-expressing fibers in the nasal mucosa
and examine their pathological changes under allergic rhinitis using genetic labeling and axonal tracing
approaches. Furthermore, we will determine their physiological responses to a variety of sneeze-inducing
molecules using a novel ex vivo calcium-imaging tool. These studies will provide important information on the
initial detection of nasal irritants and transduction of sneezing signals. In Aim 2, we will define the role of
MrgprC11+ fibers in acute sneezing. We will determine whether ablation of MrgprC11+ neurons attenuates
sneezing responses to a variety of nasal irritants and whether selective activation of MrgprC11+ sensory fibers
in the nasal mucosa evokes sneezing. These studies will establish whether MrgprC11+ sensory fibers are
required for sneezing induced by different sensory stimuli. In Aim 3, we will investigate the neuro-immune
interactions between MrgprC11+ nasal sensory fibers and mast cells in allergic rhinitis. We will test whether
degranulated mast cells activate MrgprC11+ nasal sensory fibers to induce sneezing in allergic rhinitis.
Furthermore, we will determine whether pharmacological silencing of MrgprC11+ sensory fibers is a feasible
therapeutic strategy to control sneezing associated with allergic rhinitis. These studies will not only advance our
understanding of the neuro-immune interactions that trigger sneezing, but also provide a novel neuronal target
for controlling nasal allergic symptoms."

The 2020 NIMH Strategic Plan for Research calls for investigations targeting neurobiology of mental
illness across the lifespan. Recent innovations in the field of early psychosis have established the critical
importance of timely interventions. However, little progress has been made in broader lifespan approaches to
schizophrenia (SZ) neurobiology and treatment. The lack of specific biomarkers capturing dynamic alterations
along the SZ trajectory hinders progress in targeted treatment development. Growing evidence suggests that
the SZ lifespan is the product of two distinct dimensions: aging and disease course. However, the exact
trajectories of these dimensions remain unclear. Specific biomarkers capturing unique and/or overlapping
aspects of their mechanisms are unavailable. Cognitive and broader clinical correlates of aging and SZ disease
course, and their implications for treatment, are yet to be identified. We propose to investigate differential
aspects of SZ neurobiology captured by aging and disease course, in order to develop specific biomarkers which
may offer actionable targets for intervention. The proposal is predicated on a novel mechanistic Model of SZ
Trajectories across the Adult Lifespan, positing distinct biological fingerprints within the anterior limbic circuit
for aging and disease course in SZ: (1) alterations in the circuit’s function and structure that occur earlier in the
lifespan and are larger in magnitude than the alterations expected with normal aging (accelerated aging
dimension); and (2) regionally-specific anterior limbic “hyperactivity” in early SZ, with a subsequent
transformation into “hypoactivity” in advanced SZ (disease course dimension). The proposed Model has a strong
evidential basis; it is testable; and, if confirmed, it will provide important guidance for the development of future
targeted therapeutics, e.g., reducing anterior limbic hyperactivity in early SZ vs. enhancing this same circuit’s
function in advanced SZ and along the aging trajectory. In a sample of SZ and matched healthy controls (n=168,
84/group) aged 18-75 years we will ascertain a broad panel of biomarkers [via multimodal brain imaging: novel
triple-refocusing 1H-MRS, high-resolution perfusion (Vascular Space Occupancy), and task-based fMRI], along
with comprehensive cognitive and clinical characterization. All measures will be acquired at baseline and
repeated at 2-year longitudinal follow-up. Using cutting-edge computational approaches, we will examine (i)
effects of aging and SZ disease course on anterior limbic system biomarkers, and interactions between these
effects; (ii) lifespan trajectories for different biomarkers; (iii) patterns of limbic system biomarkers in age- and SZ
disease course-based subgroups (e.g., Younger vs. Older, Early-Course vs. Advanced SZ), as well as in data-
driven subgroups (e.g., those with vs. without accelerated aging profiles); and (iv) associations between
biomarkers and cognitive and clinical outcomes. This research will advance the field by providing novel
biomarkers that capture unique neurobiological contributions of aging and disease course in SZ, and will motivate
future studies on SZ mechanisms across the lifespan, and development of precision treatments."
10892054,"Cannabinoid receptor subtype 2 (CB2) is a class-A family G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), located primarily
in immune-associated tissues but also in specific regions of the brain, and implicated in several inflammatory
diseases and addiction. Drugs targeting CB2 are attractive treatment alternatives for chronic neurological pain
and neuroinflammatory autoimmune diseases since they avoid deleterious psychotropic effects that are
associated with CB1. While drug development efforts have been primarily focused on small molecules targeting
the orthosteric site, limitations of poor selectivity, lack of efficacy, and development of resistance have hampered
such effort. At present, there is great interests in identifying GPCR allosteric modulators that either enhance
(positive allosteric modulators, or PAMs) or inhibit (negative allosteric modulators, or NAMs) agonist-induced
receptor activity. PAMs/NAMs often exhibit improved subtype selectivity and spatiotemporal sensitivity, as well as
potential biased signaling properties compared to orthosteric ligands. We have recently reported a 3.2 Å cryo-EM
structure of the agonist-bound human CB2-Gi complex. Based on such progress, the overall goals of this proposal
are to obtain a structural understanding of CB2 allosteric modulation and use our integrated computational and
experimental medicinal chemistry/biology approaches to design and synthesize novel allosteric modulators for the
development of CB2-specific small-molecules with potential to treat CB2-associated maladies. Thus, we first propose
to elucidate the structural basis for the action of CB2 allosteric modulators by cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography
approaches. To achieve the goal, we will advance our established methods for structural studies on CB2 to obtain
structure of CB2 with known PAMs or NAMs. Subsequently, we plan to perform in silico design of novel CB2 allosteric
modulators by our established molecular fingerprint machine-learning (ML) computing algorithms and receptor
docking approaches, on basis of our reported chemogenomics cannabinoid molecular information database (CBID)
and 3D CB2-Gi cryo-EM structure; a virtual allosteric modulator library will be constructed using our fragment-based
design (FBD) method and our established ML-classifiers and features-ranking will be applied for selection of virtual
hits. Results will be correlated with CB2 structure-based modulator design via adapting the structural information
obtained from our recent CB2-Gi cryo-EM structure and our novel molecular complex characterizing system (MCCS)
algorithm. Finally, we will carry out medicinal chemistry synthesis of CB2 PAM and NAM ligands and validate them
by radiometric binding and cellular functional assays. With the proof-of-evidence of our recent discovery of a putative
CB2 NAM, successful completion of these Aims will provide unprecedented structural information on CB2 allosteric
pockets, identify promising new CB2 allosteric modulators, and help to elucidate CB2 signaling and pharmacology."
10760304,"Project Summary
 Although there is a robust training infrastructure in the neurosciences that is supported by NIH, there
remain several important opportunities for increasing the representation of underrepresented minorities and
other historically disadvantaged groups in brain science. There is a population of undergraduates with formal
training in the neurosciences (obtained via classroom-based work) who nevertheless have not had the
opportunity for a high-quality, longitudinal research experience. This same population frequently also lacks
access to the relevant mentorship required for success in applying to graduate school and then subsequently
for success in neuroscience research. Because longitudinal research experience is arguably one of the few
traditional admissions criteria that predict future success in graduate school, many applicants that lack such
experience are denied admission to graduate school on this basis alone. There therefore exists an educational
gap, one we propose to address here through PiNBAC, the Harvard Program in Neuroscience post-
baccalaureate program. Through the support of the Department of Neurobiology and the T32-funded Harvard
PhD Program in Neuroscience (PiN), PiNBAC was started in 2021 with an inaugural class of seven total
scholars; two of these scholars applied to graduate school this year (one will matriculate to Harvard, the other
to Yale), with the remaining five to apply in the fall. The initial iteration of PiNBAC included a substantial
research experience in which each scholar was asked to make an intellectual contribution to a project (rather
than solely serving in a technical support role), substantial mentorship both in applying to graduate school and
in the “hidden curriculum” of higher education and scientific training, integration of PiN graduate programming
to enhance PiNBAC training, and a specific longitudinal course to give each scholar space to reflect and learn
more about science from their peers. Informal feedback and early survey results suggest that the initial version
of PiNBAC has been a success: feedback from students and mentors reveals both that the program addresses
a clear gap in available educational resources, and that participants feel the program is effective at making a
difference. Here we propose to further develop PiNBAC, and to build on its strengths, by expanding the formal
neuroscience-specific curriculum offered to scholars. PiNBAC is rooted in an innovative data-driven
pedagogical approach that has been very successfully piloted in the last year. It is our hope that through this
application we can help to build the next generation of diverse leaders in the field."

Our long-term goal is to identify neural mechanisms and the functional roles of sensorimotor signals in health
and disease as needed to guide mechanistically targeted diagnoses, assessments, and treatments for
neurological movement disorders. Here we address the scientific barriers to understanding and treating a
broad class of movement disorder symptoms recently defined as joint hyper-resistance, which encompass
spasticity in stroke, spinal cord injury, or cerebral palsy; parkinsonian rigidity, and hypertonia. The objective of
this collaborative, interdisciplinary proposal is to identify neural mechanisms of hyper-resistance and dissociate
their relative roles in abnormal movement. We will focus on the neural mechanisms underlying two clinically-
defined neural contributions to hyper-resistance: non-velocity dependent involuntary background activation and
velocity-dependent stretch hyper-reflexia. We hypothesize that increased spinal excitability in many
neurological disorders causes involuntary background activation and velocity-dependent stretch hyper-reflexia
via three dissociable neural mechanisms: 1) alpha-drive to extrafusal muscle fibers increasing background
muscle tension, 2) gamma-drive to specialized intrafusal muscle fibers in muscle spindles sensory organs,
increasing their sensitivity to muscle stretch, and 3) sensorimotor gain of the spinal transformation of
monosynaptic sensory input into motor output. Our proposed tests of this hypothesis will advance understanding
of the important, yet still unresolved relative contributions made by these neural mechanisms to hyper-resistance.
Based on our neuromechanical and multiscale modeling advances in the prior funding period, in Aim 1 we will
develop a multiscale in silico neuromuscular circuit model to predict how independent changes in alpha-
drive, gamma-drive, and sensorimotor gain differentially affect clinically-relevant movements such as the tendon
tap and pendulum test. In Aim 2, we will characterize the relative increases in alpha-drive, gamma-drive,
and sensorimotor gain across clinically-relevant spinal excitability levels in a living biological
neuromuscular circuit in vivo using a decerebrate rat preparation. In Aim 3 we will identify clinically-relevant
movement abnormalities across spinal excitability levels in a novel biohybrid robotic system coupling
the living neuromuscular circuit (in vivo) to a virtual biomechanical limb (in silico). A robotic controller will enforce
the physics of dynamically changing inertial and gravitational forces, allowing movement to emerge from the
causal interaction between the in vivo neuromuscular circuit and the virtual limb. Through the close coordination
of these Aims, we will establish a computational and experimental framework to address clinical barriers (1) to
determine how changes in neural mechanisms and the inertial properties of the limb could correct movement
abnormalities, (2) to provide insight into how these mechanisms could be identified through different clinical
assessment scenarios, and (3) to compare the relative effects of different treatment targets. The proposed work
will likely impact both clinically-relevant human sensorimotor research and basic sensorimotor neuroscience."

HIV-1-infected individuals are at a higher risk for non-AIDS related co-morbidities, including cerebrovascular
and neurological diseases. These pathologies may be driven, at least in part, by low levels of viral replication
that persist in HIV-infected brains, which can lead to immune activation, chronic inflammation, and viral
reactivation. Experiments on microglia, astrocytes, and brain pericytes indicate that these cells are all capable,
to different degrees, to harbor HIV infection. We have pioneered research on HIV-1 infection in brain pericytes,
and indicated that these cells possess the receptor profile enabling HIV-1 infection. Recent evidence on
pericyte ontogeny identified that a substantial subpopulation of brain pericytes originates from myeloid
progenitors. We recently demonstrated HIV-1-infected pericytes in human brains with HIV encephalitis.
Furthermore, our new and exciting preliminary data suggest that brain pericytes may be capable of latent
infection and reactivation, similar to other myeloid cells. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that
brain pericytes are a key, albeit previously unrecognized, cell type for the formation of HIV-1
reservoirs in the CNS. The overarching goal of the current proposal is to characterize the latent HIV-
1 infection in brain pericytes as the necessary step for successful eradication of CNS reservoirs and
HIV cure. Consistent with this goal, Specific Aims will evaluate the formation of latent HIV infection in brain
pericytes both in vivo and in vitro. In a cohort of human brain samples with a history of achieved viral
suppression obtained from the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC), we will determine whether
brain pericytes harbor latent HIV-1 infections in HIV-suppressed patients (Aim 1). In addition, we will evaluate
transcriptional signatures of latently HIV-1-infected human primary brain pericytes (Aim 2), and delineate
functional outcomes associated with HIV infection of brain pericytes (Aim 3).
The focus on the role of pericytes in the development of viral brain HIV reservoirs is an innovative and cutting-
edge conceptual approach, consistent with the current RFA. Focusing on pericytes as a novel myeloid cell
population in the context of HIV-1 infection and brain reservoirs has also a paradigm-changing potential and
is likely to lead to new discoveries in the field. The planned experiments will help us to better characterize the
pericyte reservoirs in the CNS in order to design future therapies for reservoir clearance and HIV cure."

Project Title: “Birth to Three – Cavity Free: Effectiveness of a Psychoeducational Intervention
for ECC Prevention”
 Early childhood caries (ECC) is a potentially painful and debilitating disease, which represents a
significant public health problem among young children. There are profound disparities in ECC experiences
such that children from minority and low-income families suffer a disproportionate share of the disease
burden. The likelihood of parents of high-ECC risk young children seeking prevention in dental facilities is low;
therefore, there is a need to increase preventive dental opportunities where these children already seek health
care services. In particular, there is an urgent need to develop and evaluate ECC behavioral interventions for
use in public health settings attended by high-risk children. Many authors recommend early implementation of
oral health education as one means of preventing ECC. However, major issues discussed in the oral health
promotion literature involve a lack of effectiveness among programs based on education alone, as well as a lack
of high quality preventive interventions using evidence-based psychological and behavioral strategies.
 Our research team has been the first to introduce to the ECC prevention arena the self-determination
theory (SDT) of motivation, internalization, and healthy functioning, proven effective in promoting positive
behavioral changes in several other fields, including oral health care. We have demonstrated that SDT has great
promise as a motivational approach by providing evidence, based on results from our R21 (R21-DE016483)
study, of the effectiveness of SDT in changing several desirable oral health behaviors for ECC prevention.
Building upon the rigor of our previous experience and formative research work in the past several years, we
propose a Stage II NIH Model research project that will compare the efficacy of autonomy-supportive
videotaped oral health messages framed by SDT to more traditional neutral videotaped messages. We intent to
recruit 634 pregnant mothers enrolled in Iowa Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Supplemental Nutrition
Programs and follow them until their future child is 36 months old. The primary outcome of interest will be
children's caries status. Secondary outcomes will be changes in children's oral health behaviors conducive to
better oral hygiene and dietary habits, as well as lower levels of dental plaque and mutans streptococci."
10833475,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The adaptive immune system is driven by the B Cell receptor (BCR) pathway, which triggers B cell
differentiation and proliferation in response to antigen binding. Activation of the BCR generates signaling
lipid phosphatidylinositol – 3,4,5 – triphosphate (PIP3) on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. The
pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of non-receptor tyrosine kinase Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (Btk) binds to
this PIP3, triggering release of an auto-inhibited conformation and trans auto-phosphorylation. Auto-
phosphorylated Btk activates downstream pathways, leading to B cell activation and proliferation. Overactive
BCR signaling can lead to severe malignancies, such as chronic lymphatic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma. The first Btk inhibitor, ibrutinib, was approved in 2013 by the Food and Drug Administration as
an alternative to chemotherapy for the treatment of B cell malignancies. Successful Btk inhibition slows
cancer cell proliferation by reducing the activation and binding of transcription regulator NF-κB to DNA. The
most widely used Btk inhibitors are ibrutinib and second-generation derivatives, which irreversibly bind the
ATP-binding pocket of the kinase domain. This pocket is highly conserved among tyrosine kinases and
consequently, treatment leads to significant off-target side effects and resistance due to mutations in the
binding site. These factors necessitate alternative inhibitory sites within Btk for the advancement of B-cell
cancer treatment. The critical and initial step in Btk activation is its plasma membrane association through
the PH domain. The PH domain represents an attractive inhibitory target as there is low sequence homology
among the class. However, the lipid specificity, stoichiometry of PIP3 binding and how it regulates these
assemblies, functional oligomeric states of full-length Btk, the interfaces involved, are unknown. The goal
of my proposal is to determine the lipid specificity, stoichiometry, mechanism of membrane
recruitment, and the membrane-associated oligomeric states of Btk. Through a quantitative
understanding of these molecular events, I aim to understand how the function of Btk at the plasma
membrane is regulated. I will use a workflow developed by the Gupta lab to directly detect protein-protein
and protein-lipid interactions from a lipid bilayer using native mass spectrometry (nativeMS). This will allow
me to detect the lipids that interact with Btk in a bilayer mimicking the lipid composition of the plasma
membrane as well as the oligomeric states of membrane bound Btk. I have obtained preliminary nativeMS
and vesicle association data that shows in vitro binding to PS as well as the ability to associate with bilayers
in a PS-dependent manner. I will determine the functional consequences of this yet uncharacterized lipid
interaction using an immortalized B Cell line. By activating the BCR within the presence of a PS scavenger,
I can determine whether PS plays a role in the BCR pathway, making it a mechanism for inhibition of Btk."

Vascular remodeling and restoration of blood-brain barrier (BBB) function are critical for the reestablishment of
a microenvironment that supports tissue repair and functional recovery after ischemic stroke. During
development, Wnt/β-catenin signaling functions to tightly couple central nervous system (CNS) angiogenesis to
barriergenesis. However, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding the underlying mechanisms that mediate
restoration of vascular homeostasis after ischemic injury. Damage-associated molecular patterns, released from
dying cells during ischemic brain injury, trigger an inflammatory response which can either promote or exacerbate
tissue repair. The plasticity of this response thus represents a promising therapeutic target, but this clinical
potential is hindered by an incomplete understanding of how sterile inflammation regulates vascular repair. My
preliminary data demonstrate that cerebral infarction triggers a local upregulation of type I interferon (IFN1)
signaling that is temporally aligned with the induction of peri-infarct angiogenesis, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and
peripheral immune cell infiltration. This data is compelling when viewed together with previous work showing that
IFN1 signaling regulates peripheral vascular maturation, BBB integrity, and immune cell recruitment in the
context of other diseases. However, the impact of endogenous IFN1 signaling on vascular repair after ischemic
brain injury is unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that upregulation of IFN1 signaling by ischemic
brain injury coordinates vascular remodeling and restoration of hemodynamic function by acting 1) directly on
brain endothelial cells (BECs) to restore BBB function and 2) indirectly through recruitment of peripheral
monocytes and activated microglia to promote angiogenesis. This hypothesis will be tested using a combination
of genetic, molecular, computational approaches, and in vivo functional imaging of the rodent brain with swept,
confocally aligned planar excitation (SCAPE) and two photon microscopy. Aim 1 will determine how IFN1
signaling in BECs and CNS myeloid cells regulates angiogenesis, barriergenesis and the innate immune
response after cerebral infarction. Aim 2 will establish a robust in vivo paradigm for mapping the natural trajectory
of cerebrovascular function after ischemic brain injury and determine the impact of BEC and CNS myeloid cell
IFN1 signaling on longitudinal vascular function. The proposed studies will elucidate the mechanisms by which
IFN1 signaling impacts vascular plasticity after ischemic brain injury and will establish a novel technical
framework for the molecular investigation and functional validation of candidate therapeutic targets. This
knowledge will enhance our understanding of how sterile inflammatory pathways regulate vascular repair after
ischemic stroke and has the potential to guide future therapeutic interventions to improve functional outcomes
after brain ischemia."

Around 30% of individuals who try drugs of abuse transition to addiction, suggesting that individual differences
prior to drug experience contribute to addiction vulnerability. Sign-tracking and goal-tracking phenotypes which
predict distinct drug relapse vulnerabilities, have been modelled in humans and rodents. Sign-tracking rats
show enhanced cue sensitivity prior to drug experience which predicts heightened cue-driven drug seeking and
increased cue-induced relapse as compared to goal-trackers. Men and women also differ in their addiction
vulnerability, where women show enhanced escalation of drug use and higher probability to relapse. Female
rats are more likely to be sign-trackers, suggesting a need to study sex differences in sign-tracking rats to
understand the unique neurobiological vulnerabilities in females. Sign-trackers and females are similarly
inflexible when rewarding outcomes are devalued. I have found that decreasing cannabinoid 1 receptors
(CB1R) signaling in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) makes female sign-tracking rats flexible, but has the
opposite effect in male sign-tracking rats. CB1R are expressed on orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) inputs to the DMS
and on GABAergic interneurons and medium spiny neurons in the DMS. This project will focus on the
intersection of sex and sign-tracking, investigating DMS endocannabinoid regulation of behavioral flexibility. I
hypothesize that a CB1R-mediated decrease in OFC-DMS transmission prevents flexibility in female sign-
tracking rats, while a CB1R-mediated decrease in GABAergic transmission promotes flexibility of male sign-
tracking rats. First, I will use slice electrophysiology and RNAscope to understand the functional and
expression-based differences in CB1R within the DMS between male and female ST rats. Second, I will use
chemogenetics and slice electrophysiology to investigate the contribution of OFC-DMS projection to behavioral
flexibility and the influence of CB1R activation on this projection. Through these experiments, I aim to uncover
critical molecular and circuit-based mechanisms that contribute to impairments in flexibility that are associated
with addiction vulnerability."

Family caregivers of people with dementia have to decide between tube feeding and hand feeding when
persistent eating problems arise. This decision can be difficult for Chinese-American dementia caregivers, due
to the interplay of culture, potential absence of a patient’s advance directive, poor understanding of dementia,
and lack of knowledge on the risks and benefits of tube feeding. There is a high prevalence of tube feeding
among Chinese older adults with advanced dementia; however, tube feeding does not have health benefits for
older adults with advanced dementia, and may in fact be related to increased risk and discomfort. Shared
decision-making is a process by which patients, family members, and healthcare providers work together to
create care plans that balance clinical evidence and patient preferences and values with risks and expected
outcomes. Current clinical discussions on feeding tubes rarely meet this standard. Limited research has been
conducted to improve decision quality regarding feeding options among Chinese-American dementia caregivers.
This pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) will give Dr. Pei the training, mentoring, and skills necessary
to conduct intervention research to improve decision-making about feeding options for dementia patients in
Chinese American communities. The goal of this study is to develop and pilot test a culturally adapted decision
aid intervention to support Chinese American dementia caregivers in decision making about feeding options. To
become an independent investigator in improving end-of-life decision making, Dr. Pei will receive training and
mentoring in four areas: (1) deepening the knowledge of end-of-life decision-making, (2) gaining additional
training in qualitative methods research, (3) developing proficiency in clinical trial design and (4) enhancing
professional developmental skills in grant writing, research team management, and leadership. In the K99 phase,
the candidate proposes two aims. Aim 1: Conduct individual interviews with family caregivers and healthcare
professionals to inform the adaptation of an existing intervention; Aim 2: Develop, refine, and acceptability test
the culturally adapted decision aid. In the R00 phase, the candidate aims to refine and evaluate the efficacy of
the decision aid in a pilot randomized controlled trial among 60 Chinese American dementia caregivers (Aim 3).
By the end of the R00 award, Dr. Pei will complete the transition from observational and explanatory research to
behavioral intervention work and submit an R01 proposal. Her strong mentoring team, well-established
collaboration with community organizations in New York City, and ideal environment of research support and
resources at New York University will help Dr. Pei become a successful independent investigator in improving
end-of-life decision making for older adults with dementia."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major public health problem and current therapies for its prevention are limited.
Metabolic stress is a hallmark of common conditions that predispose to AF, including aging, diabetes and
heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Yet the origins of metabolic stress and its mechanistic link to
pathological atrial remodeling remain unknown. Our central hypothesis is that signaling via the master
metabolic regulator AMPK is a key hub in the control of atrial structural and electrophysiological (EP)
properties, and that AMPK pathway inactivation, as occurs in metabolic diseases, is a unifying mechanism for
both the triggers and substrate that promote the onset and perpetuation of AF. This application will leverage
our extensive experience in studying AMPK-regulated cardiac metabolism and metabolic signaling in the
ventricle and arrhythmia mechanisms, to elucidate novel upstream mechanisms that drive adverse atrial
remodeling and AF. Specifically, we will investigate the hypothesis that AMPK pathway inactivation causes
metabolic stress induced AF. Based on recent experimental and clinical studies, together with our new
preliminary data, we hypothesize that AMPK modulates atrial electrophysiology via direct target
phosphorylation and transcriptional regulation as well as via indirect mechanisms involving AMPK mediated
metabolic/oxidative stress in the atria. We will systematically and rigorously uncover these mechanisms using
a combination of innovative genetic models, cellular and molecular biological tools and small molecule
pharmacological AMPK activators. Our experimental design integrates advanced electrophysiological studies
with state-of–the-art cardiac imaging of structure and function, using high-resolution optical action potential
mapping and gated cardiac micro-CT imaging, to comprehensively assess the physiological and structural
remodeling of the atria both in vivo and ex vivo. Aim 1 will uncover mechanisms by which AMPK pathway
inactivation promotes early atrial ectopy and the onset of AF. Aim 2 will elucidate mechanisms by which loss
of AMPK signaling promotes disease progression forming the substrate for persistent AF. Aim 3 will
determine whether AMPK activator therapy prevents and/or reverses pathological atrial remodeling and AF
propensity without provoking ventricular pro-arrhythmia. The over-arching goal of this application is to
advance our understanding of the interface between metabolic signaling, atrial electrical and structural
remodeling, and arrhythmogenesis, in order to ultimately develop innovative therapeutic approaches for AF.
Thus, the results of the proposed experiments are expected to elucidate the fundamental atrial mechanisms
that underlie the pathogenesis of AF, and to provide the foundation for future pre-clinical and clinical studies to
test the role of AMPK activators in both the prevention and treatment of AF."

Numerous observations indicate that CD8+ T cells inhibit HIV and SIV replication. More recently, two studies
conducted as part of R01-AI-125064 have shown that: (i) CD8+ lymphocytes are required to maintain virus
suppression under ART (Cartwright, Immunity 2016); and (ii) CD8 depletion reveals a powerful latency-reversal
effect by the interleukin-15 super-agonist N-803 (McBrien, Nature 2020). Collectively, these studies revealed a
previously unrecognized function of CD8+ lymphocytes that, while antiviral in its nature, in the setting of ART
may paradoxically favor the long-term persistence of CD4+ T cells harboring integrated, replication-competent
virus. If further confirmed, this hypothesis would have profound implications in terms of designing HIV “shock
and kill” cure strategies based on modulating the latency promoting activity of CD8+ T cells in combination with
agents that would promote the demise of the CD4+ T cells that have reactivated virus production.
The overarching aim of this proposal is to better understand the ultimate potential of interventions based on the
removal of CD8+ lymphocytes to disrupt SIV/SHIV persistence and reduce or even eliminate the virus reservoir
under ART. We will build upon our previously published data and use the highly relevant, well validated model
of SIV/SHIV infection of rhesus macaques (RM), to answer three important questions: (i) what are the cellular
and anatomic sources of the robust and persistent virus reactivation observed in ART-treated SIV-infected
RMs after combined treatment with CD8α depletion and N-803? (Aim #1); (ii) can we clear the CD4+ T cells
that have reactivated virus production following CD8α or CD8β depletion + N-803 administration in ART-
treated SHIV-infected RMs by treating the animals with a cocktail of Env-specific broadly neutralizing
antibodies (bnAbs)? (Aim #2); and (iii) can we induce apoptosis of the CD4+ T cells that have reactivated virus
production following CD8α depletion + N-803 administration in ART-treated SHIV-infected RMs by treating the
animals with an inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2? (Aim #3).
We are uniquely poised to conduct the proposed experimental work, with an accomplished team of
investigators and key resources at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center of Emory University. We
therefore believe that we will be able to provide novel, critical information on how the latency promoting activity
of CD8+ lymphocytes can be manipulated in vivo to reduce the persistent virus reservoir under ART."
10815774,"ABSTRACT
Recombination is both a means to avoid genome instability and to process that generates genome instability.
In meiosis, DNA double-strand breaks are repaired into crossovers that are essential for accurate
segregation of homologous chromosomes; defects in this process result in sterility or aneuploidy, the major
cause of pregnancy loss and trisomy. Conversely, in mitotically proliferating cells double-strand breaks are a
dangerous class of DNA damage. Repair of breaks in this context is done without making crossovers;
formation of crossovers in mitotic cells can lead to chromosome rearrangements and tumorigenesis.
Research in my laboratory focuses on mechanisms that promote crossovers in meiotic cells and non-
crossover outcomes of repair in mitotic cells. We have made important contributions to understand these
problems for 20 years, during which time I have trained numerous scientists who are active in research and
research-related careers. This proposal sketches out both continued and new directions that will drive the
field forward. These include investigations of how large gaps are repaired (important for designing Cas9
fragment integration experiments and Cas9-based gene drive systems) and how meiotic crossovers are
patterned (important for proper segregation of chromosomes into gametes). We use a combination of
genetics, primarily using Drosophila as a model organism, genomics, biochemistry, cell biology, evolutionary
biology, and mathematical modeling."
10758542,"Project Summary: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the
United States and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity. COPD is characterized by spirometric
airflow obstruction due to structural changes in lung parenchyma (emphysema) and airways. However, there
exists a marked discordance between spirometry diagnosis and presence of emphysema on CT.
 Emphysema on inspiratory CT is defined by low-density areas <-950 Hounsfield Units (HU). By
anatomically matching inspiratory and expiratory CT scans through image registration, we derived a CT measure
of lung elasticity termed the Jacobian determinant of lung deformation (J) which is a point-by-point measure of
lung expansion and contraction during respiration. We hypothesize that the CT-based lung mechanics will enable
identification of regions that appear normal per traditional CT density criteria but are mechanically compromised
during respiration. We will test the “Silent Zones” hypothesis by evaluating 10,300 current and former smokers
enrolled in the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) cohort with the following specific aims. In Aim 1,
we will quantify Silent Zones by matching inspiratory and expiratory CT scans and to determine their associations
with lung function, respiratory quality of life and functional capacity. In Aim 2, we will use 6,284 subjects who
completed a second COPDGene visit after 5-years to quantify the percentage of Silent Zones progressed into
emphysematous areas and also to determine the prognostic utility of Silent Zones by testing their association
with FEV1 decline and mortality. In Aim 3, we will develop a deep convolutional neural network to identify Silent
Zones directly from inspiratory CT scans, thus avoiding the computationally intensive image matching process.
 I will utilize this proposal to acquire advanced training in biostatistics, lung physiology, deep learning,
parallel computing for large medical cohorts. The opportunities created by this Career Development Award will
provide me with a clearly delineated path to acquire expertise and develop a research niche in the field of COPD.
The aims of this research proposal and career development plan are possible through the active mentorship of
Dr. Surya Bhatt, a leading expert in lung imaging research and the Director of UAB Lung Imaging Lab and Dr.
Arie Nakhmani, an expert in computer vision, image registration, and machine learning methodologies. The
proposed study will provide me with the skill set to achieve my long-term goal of an independent career in
translational research focusing on medical imaging and machine learning applications for COPD."
10754906,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Language dysfunction is a common cognitive sequela of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in 31% to 44% of TBI
survivors. One of the most prevalent sequelae, word finding difficulty (verbal retrieval deficit), can persist more
than 12 months after injury. Effective treatment and mechanism-based studies for such treatment, however,
are still lacking. High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) is a novel non-invasive
electromodulation approach that has been shown to improve verbal retrieval deficits in TBI by targeting the
pre-Supplementary Motor Area (pre-SMA). Disrupted synchronized activity involving the pre-SMA and impaired
white matter connectivity linked to the pre-SMA can result in verbal retrieval deficits. Particularly, the left frontal
aslant tract (FAT) and fronto-striatal tract (FST) support verbal retrieval function by connecting the pre-SMA to
the left inferior frontal gyrus and basal ganglia, respectively. The 3 aims of this proposal are 1) to determine
HD-tDCS modulatory effects on synchronized activity involving the pre-SMA using electroencephalography
(EEG), 2) to use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine how baseline integrity of the left FAT and FST affect
pre-SMA HD-tDCS therapeutic effects, and 3) to establish predictive models of HD-tDCS induced changes by
integrating baseline EEG and DTI measures. Both veterans and civilians with mild to moderate TBI will
undergo ten 20-minunte sessions of active or sham HD-tDCS and will be evaluated immediately and at 8
weeks after treatment completion. The central hypothesis is that pre-SMA HD-tDCS will modulate pre-SMA
associated synchronized activity to improve verbal retrieval, and that those effects will be predicated on the
degree of disruption in baseline white matter integrity and synchronized activity. The expected results will offer
a novel neurorehabilitation approach for verbal retrieval deficits across civilian and veteran TBI populations,
along with clarification of underlying mechanisms, and provide a framework to guide future research and
clinical application of electromodulation to treat TBI-related cognitive sequelae. This proposal is in line with the
NIDCD’s strategic plan under “Voice, Speech, and Language Research” including priority area 2 (“Identify the
pathophysiologic and cognitive mechanisms underlying both common and rare voice, speech, and language
impairments”) and priority area 3 (“Detection, Diagnosis and Hypothesis-Driven Interventions”). My proposed
research will contribute to understanding verbal retrieval deficits in TBI and treating individuals inflicted by
impaired communication due to such deficits. The K99/R00 Career Development Award will allow me to
acquire data and advance training in cognitive neuropsychology, DTI analysis and predictive modeling in the
K99 phase. With this foundation, I will then establish my independent research in the R00 phase that will
subsequently lead to independent funding through the NIH R01 mechanism or its equivalent by the end of the
award period."
10758558,"ABSTRACT
A significant portion of patients in the United States will suffer from chronic pain at some point in their lives,
and for a portion of these patients, our current medical and surgical options are inadequate. Novel treatments
aimed at stimulating cerebral circuits involved in nociception for clinical pain relief are promising, but require
further development of both targeting and stimulation strategies. Yet, the neural mechanisms of how human
nociception manifests as the perception of pain in cerebral circuits remains poorly understood. This proposal
leverages neurophysiological access to cortical and subcortical targets in patients undergoing the placement of
intracranial EEG electrodes to characterize pain networks in the human brain with specific access to the less
often studied nodes in the “pain network” thought to be associated with the emotional and cognitive spheres of
pain processing, including the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate regions. This unique
access will allow detailed exploration of the pain experience in a naturalistic setting based on patients’ self-
reported measures of post surgical pain, which will then be contrasted with opiate induced pain reduction. The
subset of patients with pre-existing chronic pain conditions will be analyzed for variation in the biomarker
signal. Our preliminary findings have yielded two overarching hypotheses: 1) periods of self-reported post-
surgical pain will be associated with reduced beta power in prefrontal cortex, an association that will be
reversed by the administration of opioids associated with pain relief and 2) the subset of patients with pre-
existing chronic pain conditions will have predictable variance, with increases in baseline high beta/low gamma
signal compared to patients without chronic pain. Through the use of novel clinical-research hybrid electrodes
that allow for targeted, high-resolution electrophysiological recordings, candidate target regions will then be
stimulated in an effort to re-create the associated pain reduced state electrophysiologically and clinically. This
unique access into human pain circuits will guide further understanding of the physiology of these neural
signatures and advance the long-term goal of developing novel paradigms to therapeutically modulate cerebral
circuits for the treatment of chronic, intractable pain.
This mentored award will provide critical and tailored training in 1) advanced aspects of neurophysiology
2) human experimental and clinical trial design, 3) rigorous epidemiological methods, 4) advanced
biostatistics, and 5) validated psychophysical methods for the assessment of pain under the direction
of Dr. Eric Halgren, a leading human neurophysiologist. A complementary team of co-mentors, advisors,
and consultants has been assembled, including Mary Heinricher, a leader in the field of human and
animal pain modulation, Terry Sejnowski, a pioneer in the field of theoretical neurobiology, Mark Wallace,
an expert in the field of adult pain management, and Fadel Zeidan, an expert in the functional imaging of pain
pathways in humans. The proposed research alongside a detailed career-development plan will facilitate an
improved understanding of the anatomical and electrophysiological substrates of human pain, and lay the
foundation for a successful transition towards an independent research career focused on the data-driven
advancement of neurosurgical therapeutic modalities for chronic pain."
10813881,"Abstract:
Opiate addiction extorts a tremendous toll on society, but a mechanistic understanding of how repeated exposure
to opioids such as heroin ultimately results in compulsive drug-taking and -seeking behavior in some individuals,
but not others, is still not known. A longstanding idea is that enduring changes in neural circuit function occur
because of drug-induced gene expression changes in certain brain cells. This facilitates subsequent drug-taking
and -seeking behaviors in vulnerable individuals. Unfortunately, identifying cell-type specific alterations following
drug use (typically performed in established animal models of addiction), is generally a slow and tedious process
as changes in gene expression following in vivo drug exposure are typically assayed in series, within
heterogeneous brain regions, in an a-priori hypothesis driven fashion (i.e. previous knowledge predicting a
specific gene may be involved). This dramatically limits the throughput of data collection and likely complicates
the subsequent interpretation as gene expression patterns data are typically captured from thousands to millions
of homogenized cells. Given that the nervous system is composed of highly heterogeneous tissue, re-assessing
cell type specific gene expression changes in an unbiased manner from 1000's of individual cells is desperately
needed. Here, we propose to combine our expertise in order to generate comprehensive datasets aimed at
understanding how single-cell gene expression, circuit connectivity, and neural activity patterns are impacted by
previous drug-taking behavior. These data will provide a much-needed cellular atlas and resource for the
addiction neuroscience community and will likely lead to the identification of many novel cell type, gene
expression changes, and ensembles that can be leveraged for future study."
10827432,"Project Summary
Valvular heart disease is an important health problem afflicting over 2.5% of the US population and, while
surgical repair of native tissue remains the gold standard, the reduced risk of catheter-based interventions
has provided the capability to intervene earlier in the disease process as well as in the sickest patients while
avoiding the risks of cardiopulmonary bypass. The outcomes of transcatheter procedures are not, however,
consistently superior to alternative treatments. For example, those patients receiving transcatheter edge-to-
edge repair of mitral regurgitation benefit from a significantly shorter hospital stay but require follow-up surgery
for recurrent mitral regurgitation substantially more often than those undergoing initial surgical repair. As a
second example, when transcatheter tricuspid valve repair devices are successfully deployed, they
substantially reduce the risk of death compared to medical therapy, but device implantation is successful less
than 3/4 of the time. Optimal patient care should combine the benefits of beating-heart interventions with the
effectiveness and patient-specific tailoring of surgical repair. We hypothesize that the fundamental limitation
is that catheter-based delivery greatly reduces the interventionalist's capability to visualize and to intuitively
control device delivery. To address these issues, in the prior funding period, we created the first cardioscopic
imaging systems for performing valve repair inside the blood-filled beating heart. We demonstrated that
cardioscopy can improve local visualization to such a degree that certain procedures can be accomplished in
minutes rather than hours. We also created a joystick-controlled robotic catheter that provided an intuitive
control interface and a standardized platform for performing valve repairs. These results were achieved using
transapical access to the left ventricle of the heart. For broad adoption, we need to further develop this
technology to enable its percutaneous delivery via the femoral vein. Percutaneous delivery presents
significant new challenges since the cardioscopes must be compact during vascular navigation and then
enlarge for valvular imaging. Furthermore, to enable broad adoption of transcatheter valve repairs and to
make those repairs as effective as surgical repairs, the robotic catheter should not just make a single repair
technique easy to perform, but instead should allow a clinician to easily perform a sequence of complementary
repairs as is now done in surgery. In Aim 1, we will overcome the challenges of percutaneous cardioscope
delivery by creating balloon-based cardioscope designs and demonstrating this technology for the specific
repair of mitral chordae implantation through ex vivo and in vivo testing. In Aim 2, we will design a modular
robotic catheter platform to create the capability for a single delivery system to be used to perform two
important complementary mitral valve repairs, chordae implantation and annuloplasty, through a standardized
joystick-based interface. We will evaluate this system using ex vivo and in vivo experiments."
10880234,"Neural Engineering Training Program (NETP)
NETP will train future translational scientists, engineers and clinicians to create innovative and clinically
relevant treatments for neurological disorders, by providing unique curriculum and training opportunities
for pre-doctoral students. Current treatments provide significant benefits to patients, but are in some ways
inadequate because they cannot reliably detect events (e.g. epilepsy), do not provide sensory information
at adequate resolution (visual prostheses), obtain low rate and inconsistent information (brain-machine
and peripheral nerve interfaces), or have significant side-effects (deep brain stimulation). To improve
these therapies, the field of neural engineering faces challenges related to acquiring and understanding
large amounts of data from the brain and peripheral nervous system. Clinical neural prostheses will also
require the ability to control neural circuits at high spatial and temporal resolution. Training the next
generation of leaders in Neural Engineering will accelerate the development of solutions to these
problems, but requires interdisciplinary training that not only teaches fundamental concepts but also
exposes trainees to clinical practice to inform and motivate research questions towards translational
goals. NETP will support four PhD candidates each year. NETP offers a rich, diverse curriculum as well
as a wide-range of activities to promote interactions amongst mentors and trainees. Key aspects of NETP
include co-mentoring of students by clinician-scientists, curriculum covering engineering, medical, and
scientific aspects of neural engineering, an annual statistics workshop to reinforce rigorous experimental
design and data analysis, medical seminars for engineering/basic science graduate students, specific
training in translational research, and a student run annual research symposium. The environment for
the NETP is world-class. Participating faculty leaders have expertise in neural prostheses, brain-machine
interfaces, neural signal processing, neuromodulation, computational modeling, biomaterials,
neuroscience, and bioelectronics medicine as well as medical school faculty in neurosurgery, urology,
neurology, ophthalmology, and anesthesiology. Importantly, the participating faculty include several
practicing clinicians who also serve as primary mentors for PhD students. State-of-the-art facilities include
the North Campus Research Center, Lurie nanofabrication facility, the Michigan vector core, and the
Material Characterization Center. The institutional environment is outstanding. Michigan has highly rated
engineering and medical schools with high quality research throughout the university, and is committed
to providing high quality graduate training."
10818406,"Summary/Abstract
More than 75,000 drug overdose deaths this past year were associated with opioids. To address this epidemic,
NIH has prioritized the development of more effective opioid use disorder (OUD) treatments, as current
interventions are helpful but inadequate. OUD is common among people living with Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV) and comorbid OUD/HIV increases risk for mental and physical health impairments of greater
severities. Thus, comorbid OUD/HIV patients constitute a vulnerable group and basic research must study
factors relevant to this group. We and others have data indicating that when combined, opioids and HIV
proteins induce convergent deleterious effects that likely engender problematic opioid use behaviors and
impair general health. This basic science R01 program aims to fill knowledge gaps in the individual and
combined effects of the prototypical opioid, morphine, and HIV transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein, on
mitochondrial function, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, and on animal behavior, including
those analogous to human behaviors that moderate health outcomes in patients with OUD and comorbid
OUD/HIV. Improving our understanding of Tat protein’s effects is critical to better understanding effects of HIV
because despite nearly complete viral suppression during antiretroviral therapy for HIV (ART), Tat is detectible
with repeat testing in 40% of ART-treated patients at least once over the course of a year. This is important
because Tat expression in animals induces phenotypes analogous to those observed in people living with HIV,
including impairments in anxiety, inhibitory control, and brain structural and functional deficits. Tat’s relevance
to comorbid OUD/HIV is illustrated in our pilot behavioral data indicating that Tat amplifies morphine taking,
seeking, and post-extinction reinstatement. We also test effects of dimethylfumarate (DMF), which we have
shown moderates morphine withdrawal symptoms. Studies in SIV-infected macaques report that DMF protects
mitochondria and other studies show that DMF stimulates BDNF signaling. We focus on mitochondria because
they supply most of the energy needed for neuronal and higher order brain function and they are impaired by
morphine, Tat, and in human brain in vivo in people with OUD or HIV. Our working hypothesis is that morphine,
Tat, and their combination will increase morphine self-administration, impair learning, memory, and cognitive
flexibility, impair in vivo brain mitochondrial function assessed with phosphorus (31P) magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, and will lower levels of mitochondrial biogenesis factors including Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1
and 2 expression, as determined postmortem. DMF, by protecting mitochondria and by increasing BDNF
levels, will limit morphine’s and Tat’s deleterious effects. This basic science program aims to fill important
knowledge gaps on the individual and combined effects of opioids, Tat, and DMF, and could yield data that
support applied studies of novel treatments for OUD and HIV studied by us and by others, including DMF."

 Dr. Lindsey Reif is a global health epidemiologist with a career goal to leverage epidemiologic research to
implement high-impact health interventions for adolescents and young adults living with HIV (AYALH). Over
the past decade, she has published 10 first-author papers focused on evaluating health outcomes and
interventions among AYALH in Haiti. AYALH, who have survived decades of HIV, now face HIV-related
comorbidities, specifically cardiovascular disease (CVD), as they age into adulthood. Her K01 objective is to
expand her training and research to focus on HIV-related preclinical CVD— asymptomatic cardiometabolic
abnormalities indicating the onset of CVD—among AYALH. She will adapt evidence-based interventions to
prevent early onset CVD with impact for AYALH across the lifecourse.
 Her training objectives are to build expertise in: 1) CVD epidemiology among AYALH, 2) mixed-methods,
and 3) implementation science in order to design and implement interventions to prevent CVD morbidity and
mortality. Her career development plan includes multidisciplinary mentorship from a team that brings
decades of experience in research among AYALH, HIV and CVD epidemiology, and implementation science
across global health settings. The team has an impeccable track record of mentorship in global health
research. Dr. Reif will also take complementary advanced coursework to support her training objectives. Her
K01 is supported by a robust research and training environment that leverages a 40-year collaboration
between Weill Cornell (New York) and GHESKIO (Haiti).
 Dr. Reif’s research plan establishes the epidemiology of preclinical CVD among AYALH and adapts an
evidence-based intervention to prevent the onset of preclinical CVD and its progression. She will conduct a
prospective cohort study among 500 HIV+ and 500 HIV- participants ages 18-30 years, followed for 3 years in
Haiti. In Aim 1, she will evaluate the prevalence, age of onset and progression of preclinical CVD (pre-
hypertension, microalbuminuria, and dyslipidemia) by HIV serostatus. She will evaluate risk factors in 3
domains: lifestyle, HIV-related, and psychosocial. She hypothesizes clusters of risk factors, driven by HIV-
related and psychosocial factors, are associated with preclinical CVD among AYALH. In Aim 2, she will adapt
the evidence-based WHO HEARTS technical package for AYALH in LICs using mixed methods and
implementation science. This K01 addresses the knowledge gap of the epidemiology of preclinical CVD among
AYALH and informs the adaptation of evidence-based CVD interventions to prevent premature disability and
death among this population as they emerge into adulthood. Dr. Reif’s training and career development plan
complement and expand her existing skillset and culminate in the submission of an NIH R01 facilitating her
transition to independent investigator."
10906005,"HISTONE MODIFICATIONS GUIDING HIV INTEGRATION
PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
with ~36.7 million people currently infected worldwide. Integration of the viral genome establishes an irreversible
insertion of the proviral sequence into the host chromatin. The integrated genome ensures effective HIV gene
expression and ultimately virus production or the establishment of latency where the provirus remains dormant
for an extended time. Retroviral integration is mediated by the viral integrase (IN) protein that is bound to the
direct-repeated ends of the viral DNA genome, along with additional cellular and viral co-factors that direct
integration to host chromatin sites. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand how viral integration
is targeted to chromatin by histone post translational modifications (PTMs), and how cellular factors that tightly
control the localization of these PTMs influence target site choice.
LEDGF/p75 is a key cellular transcription co-activator that binds to HIV-1 IN via a C-terminal integrase binding
domain (IBD). The N-terminus of LEDGF/p75 contains a PWWP domain that is expected to recognize histone
methylated lysine PTMs. Bimodal tethering of the HIV-1 integration complex (intasome) to a transcription-related
histone PTM has been proposed to account for the observed ~76% of chromosomal integrations that occur in
actively transcribed genes. LEDGF/p75 purportedly targets HIV-1 to nucleosomes containing trimethylation of
histone H3 lysine 36 residues (H3K36me3). However, H3K36me3 is most often found at the 3’ ends of
transcribed genes, whereas HIV-1 integrates more frequently toward the 5’ ends of genes.
Bioinformatic correlations of HIV-1 integration sites with histone PTMs is limited by the data available in the
Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) database. Notably absent from ENCODE are genomic maps of the
H3K36me2 PTM in any cell type. We performed a ChIP-Seq analysis of H3K36me2 and determined that it was
commonly found near the 5’ transcription start site of genes. Moreover, we found that HIV-1 integration sites
correlate better with the location of H3K36me2 than H3K36me3. We propose to examine the role of H3K36me2
and H3K36me3 with two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will expand the current understanding of H3K36 methylation and
its connection to HIV-1 integration efficiency and site selection in vivo. Aim 2 will probe the influence of
H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 on HIV-1 integration in vitro. Our approaches will include technologically advanced
mass spectrometry, integration site mapping, and single molecule fluorescence microscopy. The results of these
studies will clearly determine the role of H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 during HIV-1 integration."

The innate immune system is the first line of host defense against invading pathogenic microorganisms. Innate
immune cells can recognize these pathogens to induce cytokines against infections. However, this immune
response must be tightly regulated to effectively eliminate invading microorganisms while minimizing tissue
inflammation. Protein ubiquitination is important both in signal transduction and in proteasome-mediated protein
degradation and is a pivotal regulatory mechanism for the innate immune system. A key component of the
ubiquitination system is E3 ligase to specifically recognize the substrate for modification. We recently found that
a TRIM family member, E3 ligase TRIM29, is highly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). IECs act as a
physical barrier between the external environment and the mucosal immune system. Importantly, after activation,
IECs become innate immune-like cells to produce robust proinflammatory cytokines. We posit that TRIM29 is a
key immune regulator to suppress innate immune response in a cell/tissue-specific manner to reduce intestinal
inflammation. Notably, in the gut, genes encoding inflammasome components such as CARD9, NLRP3 and
Caspases are associated with intestinal inflammation, and mice deficient in these genes are susceptible to colitis
and fungal infection. However, hyperactive inflammasome signaling and uncontrolled IL-1 family cytokines lead
to immune disorders and inflammatory disease. For instance, overproduction of inflammasome cytokine IL-18,
excessive activation of NLRP3-inflammasome, or aberrant immune response to fungus play a major pathogenic
role in colitis. Thus, this immune response must be finely tuned during immune activation for optimal protection
against infections while avoiding unwanted inflammation. However, little is known about how such activation is
terminated. Our preliminary studies show that TRIM29 negatively regulates IL-1 family cytokines produced by
IECs during colitis or fungal infection. Moreover, expression of TRIM29 itself is significantly downregulated in
inflamed colons, whereas production of IL-1 family cytokines is elevated. However, it is unknown whether lost
expression of TRIM29 is regulated by IL-1 family cytokines and/or epigenetic modifications to control responses
to environment stimuli in the intestines. We hypothesize that TRIM29 expression in IECs is a checkpoint
regulator of IL-1 family cytokines crucial to reduce intestinal inflammation in colitis and fungal infection.
We propose the following three aims to test this hypothesis: (1) To dissect molecular pathways that control
TRIM29 expression in epithelial cells under normal and inflammatory conditions; (2) To define the mechanism
by which TRIM29 inhibits IL-1 inflammation; (3) To investigate in vivo functions of TRIM29 in regulating IECs
function in colitis and anti-fungal immunity."

 Despite fairly clear understanding on the molecular basis of various anesthetic agents, the systems-level
neural mechanism by which anesthetics induce unconsciousness remains elusive. Substantial evidence
suggests that anesthetic-induced unconsciousness (AIU) is a brain network phenomenon. Anesthetics appear
to suppress consciousness by disrupting information exchange across large-scale brain networks. Therefore, to
understand the systems-level mechanism underlying AIU, a critical step is to comprehensively characterize
how whole-brain networks dynamically reorganize to support different patterns of information exchange
during AIU. This issue can be studied using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), as
it measures between-region functional connectivity (FC) with a whole-brain field of view. In particular,
applying rsfMRI to animal models offers several advantages for studying AIU: 1) Intracranial electrophysiology
can be concurrently measured with rsfMRI in animals to reveal characteristic neural activity/connectivity
patterns and the corresponding global brain network dynamics during AIU; 2) distinct anesthetic agents can be
applied to the same group of animals so that common brain network changes during AIU shared by different
anesthetics, if any, can be identified; and 3) anesthetic depths can be easily manipulated. However, a major
obstacle to fully realize these potentials is that animal fMRI experiments typically use anesthesia to
immobilize animals first. Consequently, it is very difficult to reveal how brain networks change from the awake
state into an unconscious state. To bridge this gap, our group has established the approach of conducting
rsfMRI experiments in fully awake animals. In addition, we have integrated our awake rat rsfMRI approach
with multi-laminar electrophysiology recording and animal behavior, which allows us to directly link brain
network reorganization to concurrent neural activity patterns and animal’s consciousness states. By using
rsfMRI, electrophysiology and behavioral tests, the primary objective of this grant is to comprehensively
elucidate the dynamic reorganization of the whole-brain functional network to support different patterns of
information exchange from the awake state into an unconscious state. Four anesthetics, including isoflurane,
propofol, ketamine and dexmedetomidine will be tested. In Aim 1, we will identify characteristic neural
activity and brain connectivity patterns at different steady consciousness levels. In Aim 2, we will
systematically characterize topological changes of brain networks during AIU. In Aim 3, we will elucidate
layer-specific cortical activity and connectivity patterns, as well as brain network dynamics during the loss and
recovery of consciousness. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive
framework of how whole-brain networks dynamically reconfigure during AIU. Given the tight link between FC
and conscious states, it will broadly shed light onto the neural basis of consciousness, and help reveal
biomarkers to indicate levels of consciousness."

Our goal in the Oklahoma C. difficile U19 program is to transform a strong research base on enteric bacterial
pathogens into a nationally-recognized center of excellence for research on C. difficile. Our research goals,
commensurate with RFA-AI-022-001 are to provide basic knowledge that explains why vaccine-induced
immunity provides suboptimal protection against C. difficile, to understand the human memory B cell response
to the pathogen, and to advance the development and testing of second generation vaccine candidates. To
achieve these goals, three independent but complementary Research Projects have been devised which are
supported by an Administrative Core that includes bio-statistics support, and a Research Core to allow for
integrated and consistent C. difficile challenge experiments within and between the Research Projects. The
following Specific Aims will therefore be accomplished: Specific Aim 1: Establish a center of excellence for
research on C. difficile. Specific Aim 2: Test a second-generation vaccine candidate that shifts the balance
between the pathogen and host resulting in a more efficacious vaccine response and determine how C. difficile
toxin B subverts those responses (Project 1). Specific Aim 3: Determine the functional diversity of human TcdB-
specific memory B cell-derived antibody (Project 2). Specific Aim 4: Determine the impact of TcdA and TcdB on
the enteric nervous system-coordinated humoral response to vaccination and infection (Project 3). These efforts
will also be supported by NIH-funded programs at OUHSC that provide vital additional resources. By the end of
the first five year funding period we will advance the goal of understanding why vaccine responses to C. difficile
are sub-optimal, advance a second generation vaccine, and establish the means for a sustained research
program on C. difficile."

The overall objective of this proposal is to use existing and develop new single-molecule techniques to gain
mechanistic insights into the critical processes occurring during DNA repair. DNA repair processes, which are
the guardian of the genome, involve multiple sequential enzymatic steps that require the coordinated assembly
and action of many proteins on DNA. The transient nature of these interactions presents significant challenges
to elucidating the molecular mechanisms of DNA repair using traditional biochemical methods. Single molecule
approaches are well suited to overcome these difficulties; however, they present their own challenges, requiring
innovative solutions. My laboratory focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms of DNA mismatch repair
(MMR) and on development of single-molecule tools that give us access to previously unattainable information.
MMR plays a major role in reducing genomic mutations, including correcting DNA replication errors,
modulating cellular responses to DNA damaging agents, and preventing recombination between diverged
sequences. Mutations that inactivate MMR proteins cause Lynch syndrome, the most common hereditary
cancer, as well as resistance to several DNA damaging agents used to treat cancer. Surprisingly, in trinucleotide
repeat (TNR) expansion, which causes some neurodegenerative diseases, MMR proteins cause mutations that
promote repeat expansion and disease. MutSa/MutSb initiates MMR by binding to a mismatch/insertion
deletion loop and undergoing ATP-dependent conformational changes that promote its interaction with one or
more MutLa proteins. Subsequently, PCNA and ATP activate MutLa to incise the daughter strand, and MutSa
activates EXO1 to processively excise the DNA containing the error, followed by resynthesis and ligation.
Similarly, in TRE, MutSb binds looped out DNA trinucleotide repeats and recruits MutLa and/or MutLg, but
instead of leading to repair, this process promotes expansions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that
underlie these different processes is essential for developing effective treatments for the associated cancers and
neurodegenerative diseases. Single-molecule, structural, and biochemical studies, including several from our
laboratory, indicate that the conformational dynamics and assembly states of the proteins and protein-DNA
complexes are central to the regulation of MMR and TRN expansion. We will continue our mechanistic studies
of MMR and extend them to TNR expansion. We are taking an integrative approach in which we utilize an
array of single-molecule techniques, including AFM and single-molecule fluorescence, to examine MMR in
multiple organisms in vitro and in vivo, as well as initiating studies on TNR expansion. We will focus on
examining the temporal and spatial assembly of proteins on DNA during initiation of MMR and TNR
expansion. Finally, we will continue to develop single-molecule tools, such as DREEM that allows us to “see”
DNA inside protein-DNA complexes and “high-throughput” AFM. These technologies expand the single-
molecule toolbox, enrich the structural information from AFM, and directly benefit our MMR studies."

 The heart is a unique organ from an immunological perspective, as it exhibits extremely low tolerance to damage
and inflammation. Growing evidence from basic and clinical research suggests that sterile inflammation, triggered by
either acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) or chronic metabolic disorders (i.e., type-2 diabetes), plays a critical
role in the development of heart failure, a leading cause of death worldwide. Unfortunately, clinical trials attempting
to modulate inflammation in heart failure have been either disappointing or inconsistent and none are yet clinically
applicable. This sobering fact reinforces the urgent need to explore new mediators of cardiac inflammation and to
better understand their underlying molecular/cellular mechanisms. The studies supported by NIGMS in the principal
investigator’s laboratory over the past 5 years have identified several novel mediators and their associated signaling
pathways to control immune dysfunction in inflammation-triggered heart injury. First, we discovered that secreted
and transmembrane 1a (Sectm1a), a protein highly expressed in immune cells of myeloid lineage, is essential for
macrophage (MФ) efferocytosis to clear dead cells from I/R hearts and thereby, restoring cardiac function. Second,
using type-2 diabetic (T2D) mice as a chronic low-grade inflammation model, we identified that loss of lipocalin 10
(Lcn10), a poorly characterized member of the lipocalin superfamily, could cause an imbalanced MФ polarization in
T2D hearts. Finally, we have made a novel finding that extracellular membrane vesicles (EVs) released by probiotic
bacteria can promote MФ efferocytosis, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Together, these diverse and
compelling data provide a strong basis to address three critical knowledge gaps in the study of sterile
inflammation-triggered heart injury, which will be examined by three different projects of this MIRA application: 1)
what are exact roles and underlying mechanisms of endogenous and exogenous Sectm1a in MФ efferocytosis during
acute cardiac I/R? 2) can elevation of Lcn10 in MФs and/or administration of recombinant Lcn10 protein (rLcn10)
drive MФs to an anti-inflammatory phenotype for improving cardiac function in T2D mice? and 3) can a probiotic
bacterial EV-based nano-drug be developed to modulate MФ function or phenotype for repairing I/R or T2D hearts?
The proposed work represents a paradigm shift in MФ biology by defining the roles of three novel modulators
(Sectm1a, Lcn10, and bacterial EVs) in the regulation of MФ function and polarization. We will utilize multiple genetic
mouse models (MФ-specific transgenic, global knockout, and intercross models) and an adoptive MФ transfer model
to determine cardiac outcomes in two sterile inflammation conditions (acute myocardial I/R-induced robust and
chronic T2D-triggered low-grade inflammation). These projects, if completed, will significantly push the field of MФ
research forward, and offer new therapeutic options for reducing sterile inflammation-caused heart injury, with the
hope of improving heart failure patient survival."
10807005,"Inositol is essential for the viability of eukaryotic cells. Myo-inositol is the precursor of all inositol compounds,
which play pivotal roles in cell signaling and metabolism. Consistent with its importance, perturbation of inositol
homeostasis is associated with pathologies as diverse as neurological and psychiatric illnesses, myopathies,
cancer, and diabetes. Furthermore, inositol depletion is a hypothesized therapeutic mechanism of action of drugs
used to treat bipolar disorder, a devastating psychiatric illness that affects ~2% of the population. In this light, it
is striking that very little is known about the regulation of inositol homeostasis in human cells. Our research
seeks to determine how inositol synthesis is regulated and how inositol deprivation affects essential
cellular functions in human cells. Toward this end, we identified the first negative transcriptional regulator of
inositol synthesis in mammalian cells – inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1). IP6K1 represses expression
of ISYNA1, the gene coding for the rate-limiting enzyme of inositol synthesis, myo-inositol-3-P synthase (MIPS).
Further, we demonstrated that binding of IP6K1 to phosphatidic acid (PA) is required for nuclear localization of
IP6K1 and repression of MIPS expression. Our first project will rigorously dissect the mechanism of
regulation of ISYNA1 by IP6K1. To elucidate the consequences of inositol deprivation, we constructed an
ISYNA1 knock-out (ISYNA1-KO) human cell line, which cannot synthesize inositol. Inositol-deprived ISYNA1-
KO cells exhibit profound alteration of lipid homeostasis and expression of genes involved in stress signaling.
Specifically, we observed an increase in ceramides and increased expression of genes that mediate the unfolded
protein response (UPR), a stress response that is activated by ceramides. Our second project will test the
hypothesis that inositol deprivation results in activation of the UPR pathway by upregulating ceramides.
Intriguingly, inositol-deprived cells exhibited increased levels of monolysocardiolipin (MLCL), which is the
biochemical hallmark of the mitochondrial disorder Barth syndrome. Consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction,
we observed increased activation of ERK, a promoter of mitochondrial fission, in inositol-starved cells. The third
focus of our studies will test the working hypothesis that inositol deprivation perturbs mitochondrial
function. Successful completion of the proposed studies will lead to the first molecular model of regulation of
inositol synthesis in mammalian cells and demonstrate how inositol deprivation affects the cellular stress
response and mitochondrial function. This knowledge will have important implications for understanding inositol
homeostasis as well as the therapeutic mechanisms of inositol-depleting mood stabilizing drugs."

Sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a small vessel disease caused by cerebrovascular deposition
of amyloid-β (Aβ). CAA frequently overlaps with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), presumably because Aβ is
considered major culprit in development of AD pathology. Importantly, there is no disease-specific treatment
available to patients with CAA. Relevant to this project, molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of
CAA are incompletely understood thereby limiting our ability to prevent initiation and progression of this
disease. Despite mechanistic differences between vascular-induced brain injury in CAA and
neurodegenerative injury in AD, clinically, CAA overlaps with AD and it is associated with more severe
cognitive impairment in AD patients. This application is designed to advance the concept that in early stages of
CAA, deposition of endothelium-derived Aβ in cerebral blood vessel wall is an important mechanism
contributing to pathogenesis of the disease. We performed extensive preliminary studies on cultured human
brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), mouse microvessels, and brain endothelial cells isolated by
fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Next generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to determine
global gene expression profiles in human and murine cerebrovascular endothelium. Genetically modified mice
and a murine experimental model of CAA were used to validate and expand observations obtained in cultured
human endothelium. We identified previously unrecognized (Aβ-independent) endothelial functions of β-site
amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) and its homologue (BACE2). Consistency between
findings in human and murine endothelium was in agreement with strong evolutionary conservation of BACE1
and BACE2. However, while endothelial BACE1 exerts detrimental vascular effects, endothelial BACE2
appears to be previously unrecognized and very important vascular protective molecule. Further preliminary
analyses of BACE1 and BACE2 function and signaling in endothelium of mice vulnerable to development of
CAA, suggested that dysfunctional BACE1 and BACE2 in endothelium promote elevated Aβ deposition in the
cerebral blood vessels. Based on these preliminary findings our working hypothesis is that endothelial BACE1
and BACE2 play distinct roles in cerebrovascular homeostasis and pathogenesis of CAA. We anticipate that
successful completion of this project will offer new opportunities to utilize endothelial BACE1 and BACE2 as
molecular targets for therapeutic interventions designed to prevent detrimental effects of CAA on
cerebrovascular and cognitive function."

Clostridioides difficile is the leading nosocomial infection in the US, and is characterized by recurrent infection
and poor generation of antibacterial antibody responses. Identifying how C. difficile evades the adaptive immune
system is critical to develop rational treatments for patients with C. difficile infections and to prevent recurrence.
Interestingly, the major risk factors for C. difficile infection (broad spectrum antibiotic usage, proton pump inhibitor
treatment, inflammatory bowel disease) all result in either a loss or dysfunction of nerves in the gut. Infection
with C. difficile also results in a profound loss of nerves in the colon of mice. It is currently unknown if a loss of
innervation in the gut can be a primary driver of CDI susceptibility. Additionally, there is increasing awareness of
the outsized role of the nervous system in promoting immune function. Sensory nerves directly sense pathogens,
cellular damage, and noxious chemicals in order to allow organisms to respond and eliminate damage.
Adrenergic nerves in the spleen and lymph nodes are necessary for optimal B cell responses to vaccination and
infection. We posit that sensory nerve signaling from the site of infection or vaccination communicates through
the nervous system to the adrenergic nerves in lymphoid organs to promote immune responses. Given the
important role for neuronal signaling in promoting immunity, is it perhaps unsurprising that numerous pathogens
across a wide diversity of species specifically target the nervous system. Significantly, the C. difficile exotoxins
TcdA and TcdB both have neuronal activity in addition to their well described function in the inactivation of Rho
GTPases by glucosylation. In collaboration with Dr. Mark Lang, we have found that TcdA inhibits the
development of antigen-specific antibody responses during vaccination, and this inhibition was dependent upon
sensory nerve signaling; desensitization of these nerves during vaccination restored antibody responses even
in the presence of TcdA. Combined with our finding that CDI induces profound neuronal loss in the gut, We
hypothesize that TcdA and TcdB manipulation and deletion of nerves is necessary for C. difficile infection and
immune evasion. In Specific Aim 1 we will determine the role of neuronal signaling in C. difficile infection and
immune evasion. In Specific Aim 2 we will identify the mechanism by which TcdA hyperactivation of sensory
nerves impairs humoral immunity. These studies will advance the C. difficile vaccination field by revealing specific
mechanisms that limit successful humoral immune responses to vaccination and infection, and determining
whether neuropreservation is a critical correlate of protection for CDI."

The proposed studies are focused on our long-term effort to delineate the functional contribution
of canonical and non-canonical nucleotide metabolite mRNA 5¢ end caps and their removal in the
control of RNA stability and gene expression. Regulation of RNA turnover is a critical step in the
modulation of gene expression and minor alterations in mRNA stability can have profound
consequences and may manifest as clinical phenotypes. A key component controlling the fate of
eukaryotic mRNA is the 5¢-end cap. Eukaryotic caps are generally thought to possess a canonical
N7 methyl guanosine (m7G) cap at their 5¢-end to promote their stability and translation. Removal
of the m7G cap (decapping) is exquisitely regulated and renders the RNA translationally silent and
subject to rapid decay and gene silencing. Moreover, a recent exciting paradigm shift emerged
with the demonstration that eukaryotic RNAs can also carry noncanonical 5´end nucleotide
metabolite caps, initially of nicotinamide adenine diphosphate (NAD) and subsequently flavin
adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and Uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). Such
caps provide a potential link between RNA metabolism and cellular metabolism. However, there
is a major gap in our understanding of these novel caps and their physiological function as well
as their unambiguous identification. Thus, a detailed mechanistic understanding of the individual
novel nucleotide metabolite capped RNAs and their functional consequence on cellular energetics
and gene expression will have broad implications for cells in both normal and disease states."

In vertebrate cells the cohesin protein complex plays critical roles in nuclear structure and function. It tethers
together the identical products of DNA replication, called sister chromatids, until cell division and it also
mediates intra-chromosomal bridging interactions, forming chromosome loops and domains. While cohesion
between sister chromatids is critical for accurate chromosome segregation and certain kinds of DNA repair, the
compaction of chromosomes into loops and domains is essential for proper transcription and normal
development. How these different kinds of cohesion differ at the molecular level, the mechanisms that ensure
each outcome, and the amount of overlap between them are not well understood. The existence of multiple
orthologs of a number of cohesin subunits and regulators, as well as the presence of Sororin, which is unique
to metazoans, suggest complexity of cohesin regulation in higher eukaryotes. Our work addresses several key
challenges in the field: 1) how are DNA replication and cohesin regulation properly integrated in vertebrate
cells, 2) how do vertebrate-specific elaborations of the cohesion apparatus contribute to function, and 3) how
can cohesin be remodeled locally to ensure specific outcomes, such as changes in gene expression or access
and function of DNA repair machinery. As previously, we will continue to work in multiple systems as
appropriate, including genome-modified cultured cells, cell free lysates from frog eggs, frog embryos, and
purified proteins in vitro. Our strength lies in using molecular genetic approaches that allow us to test directly
the impacts of specific interactions, in all of these experimental systems. By following up on our recent work, at
the end of this next funding period we hope to fully understand how the ESCO1 and ESCO2 vertebrate
cohesin modifiers, through their strikingly unstructured domains, stabilize cohesion in a context-specific
manner. We will also define how proteins at the DNA replication fork, particularly the initiation factor TICRR,
impact cohesin stabilization, and the regulation of this process during early development. Finally, we will exploit
a tractable model for site-specific DNA damage to characterize the contributions of vertebrate cohesin
regulators and modifications to damage-induced local cohesin remodeling and thus genome maintenance."

Breast cancer is a complex disease that is sensitive to environmental factors like cigarette smoke (CS),
which contains many toxic chemicals that are mutagenic and increases the risk of many cancers,
including breast cancer. Electronic cigarettes (E-Cigs) are battery-powered devices that entered the
market in 2007 to provide a safe alternative for cigarette smokers and has taken the younger population
by storm. However, concerning reports are emerging that E-Cig, with or without nicotine, also contains
similar to CS, scores of toxic chemicals that are deleterious to health. Therefore, it is important to
examine key players that contribute to short and long-term effects of E-Cig on breast cancer, which is
susceptible to DNA damage and genomic instability. Our preliminary data in E-Cig exposed breast
cancer MDA-MB-468 xenografts in Balb/c mice indicates higher tumor growth, which was accompanied
by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced super oxide dismutase (SOD) activity, increased
NF-kB signaling and upregulated chemokines implicated in immune evasion. Based on our preliminary
findings, we hypothesize that E-Cig exposure induces oxidative stress to reprogram cancer cells and
tumor microenvironment to promote breast cancer growth. We will test our hypothesis under these
Specific Aims: Aim 1: To determine whether 1A) E-Cig-induced oxidative stress up-regulates pro-
survival pathways to promote breast tumor growth, and 1B) Genetic and pharmacological
modulation of oxidative stress influences E-Cig-induced breast tumor growth. E-Cig exposed
xenografts in Balb/c nude mice from African American (MDA-MB-468 and HCC70) and Caucasian
(MDA-MB-231 and BT549) breast cancer cells will be analyzed for tumor growth, markers for oxidative
stress (ROS/SOD/Nrf2/NOX), TNF-α/NF-KB signaling and subset of mammary cancer stem cells
(MCSC). Effect of genetic and pharmacological manipulation of ROS on breast tumor growth will be
assessed by SOD shRNA and anti-oxidants. Aim 2: To determine whether- 2A) E-Cig preferentially
re-programs cancer/host cells to facilitate immune evasion within tumor microenvironment and
promote breast cancer progression, and 2B) Treatment with CD25 monoclonal antibody
suppresses regulatory T cells (Tregs) function and reduces E-Cig-mediated breast tumor
growth. RNA sequencing data (for human and mouse genes) from AA and CA TNBC xenografts Balb/c
nude mice will be subjected to computational analysis for immune gene signatures in tumor/host cells.
The immune signatures will be validated in transgenic MMTV-PyMT mice exposed to E-Cig
aerosol/saline. We will also examine the effect of anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody treatment on
suppression of Tregs and E-Cig-induced breast tumor growth. Successful completion of this project will

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common form of pancreatic cancer. It is
the seventh leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide with the 5-year survival rate
standing only at less than 9%. Three major issues in pancreatic tumor treatment are; poor
availability of anticancer molecules due to limited blood supply to pancreas, development of
resistant to first line agent e.g. Gemcitabine and extensive fibrosis in tumor stroma. There is an
urgent need for a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for PDAC via simultaneously targeting
tumor and its tumor microenvironment. Given the central role of Myc as a mediator of multiple cell
proliferation and survival pathways, it is very essential to target the proto-oncogenic expression
of Myc and controlling K-Ras mediated drug resistance in pancreatic cancer. On another side,
collagen type I dense extracellular matrix of solid tumor severely restricts the uptake of drug,
monoclonal antibodies and nanotherapeutics within pancreatic tumor. Overexpressed focal
adhesion kinase (FAK) in pancreatic cancer plays role in angiogenesis, fibrosis and metastasis.
We hypothesize that oral delivery of FAK inhibitor (PND1186) will facilitate the uptake and
penetration of BRD4 PROTAC albuminosomes. PROTAC is novel class of anticancer molecules
which selectively degrades the targeted protein instead of mere inhibiting it. Preliminary studies
in our laboratory revealed that BRD4 Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) and FAK inhibitor
– PND1186 inhibit the growth of pancreatic cancer cells, and endothelial cells in 2D and 3D
culture. Nanoformulation showed significant enhancement in solubility and stability. Thus, we
propose a combination therapy using a long circulating albumin coated nanoliposome of BRD4
PROTAC and PND1186 (Albuminosomes). The aim of proposed SuRE award is to explore the
albuminosomes for pancreatic tumor specific delivery of BRD4 PROTAC and role of PND in tumor
uptake of nanoparticle. To achieve this goal, we propose two specific aims; Specific aim 1.
Systematic characterization of ARV-loaded albuminosomes (AAnano) and PND nanoformulation
(PNDnano). Specific aim 2. Anticancer efficacy, tumor uptake and toxicity evaluation of AAnano
and PNDnano in human pancreatic tumor xenograft model. Considering the scarcity of effective
therapy for PDAC, the proposed idea has significant clinical relevance."

The opioid crisis has made it apparent that there is a tremendous need for analgesic drugs that do not target the
opioid receptors. Plants are an ideal source for developing these drugs, as they produce a diverse range of
natural products with analgesic activity, like salicylic acid, capsaicin, and cannabidiol. These compounds act on
different pain response systems in animals, like the endocannabinoid system. Aconitum, a genus of plants in the
Ranunculaceae family, is used in different traditional medicine systems around the world, often for its analgesic
and/or anti-inflammatory properties. In traditional Chinese medicine, Aconitum carmichaelii has been used for
thousands of years, and the bioactivity has been associated mainly with its diterpenoid alkaloid content. While
these compounds have been shown to be potent analgesics, some are cardiotoxic as well. Despite their similar
medicinal use, American Aconitum species have not been as thoroughly studied in terms of chemistry or
bioactivity. The long-term goal of our research is to identify, characterize, and quantify therapeutic components
in plants used in traditional medicine systems as sources of new drugs. The overall objective of this project is to
analyze Aconitum in North America, specifically regarding its analgesic diterpenoid alkaloids that lack
cardiotoxicity as compared to the better-studied Asian species. Our initial studies on Aconitum showed significant
variation in chemical structures and amounts of selected diterpenoid alkaloids, and we have identified fuziline
and neoline from Asian Aconitum carmichaelii as having analgesic activity without being cardiotoxic. Other
studies have found that these diterpenoid alkaloids target the cannabinoid receptors. Thus, we hypothesize that
a small group of diterpenoid alkaloids in American Aconitum species will have analgesic properties without the
concomitant cardiotoxicity. We will test this hypothesis by carrying out three aims. In Aim 1, we will collect and
examine eight Aconitum species and determine patterns of diterpenoid alkaloids using untargeted LC-QToF-MS
metabolomic studies. In Aim 2, we will assess plant extracts, fractions, and purified diterpenoid alkaloids from
American Aconitum species in high-throughput zebrafish assays to identify bioactive compounds that target pain
but do not have cardiotoxicity. In Aim 3, we will use a targeted LC-TQD-MS analysis to quantify the target
analgesic compounds in the eight Aconitum species, and join the metabolomic and biological data obtained in
Aims 1 and 2 together through novel metabolomic platforms, such as NP analyst, to create a molecular network
of analgesic compounds produced by Aconitum that lack cardiotoxicity Together, the completion of these three
aims will result in a group of analgesic compounds that will be prioritized for further preclinical studies. This
project will also train undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups in modern
applications and technologies of natural product chemistry and provide them with opportunities for career
development by presenting at conferences and authoring manuscripts."

Human complex traits are jointly influenced by genetic and environmental risk factors, whose exact
contributions are often subject to extensive debate. Detailed environmental risk factors are not often available,

Nonpharmacological pain treatments (NPTs) are supported by evidence and widely recommended in treatment
guidelines. However, these approaches remain underused. Even as access increases, several patient-related
barriers remain, including lack of knowledge about NPT availability and effectiveness, poor patient-provider
communication, and challenges to engagement and adherence –particularly important as NPTs typically
require more commitment, time, and effort than taking medications. These barriers may be especially
pronounced for patients with comorbid depression, since depressive symptoms can interfere with pain
management, and for Black patients, who continue to experience disparities in pain treatment, including being
offered fewer treatment options than White patients. The overall goal of this proposal is to refine, test, and
prepare to implement a novel approach to overcoming patient-related barriers to NPT use that is tailored to
Black patients with comorbid pain and depression. EQUIPD (Equity Using Interventions for Pain and
Depression) uses 1) a decision aid focused on NPTs to increase use, and 2) a coach to foster patient
engagement and treatment adherence. Drawing on a heuristic model of multi-level mechanisms of racial
injustice in pain outcomes, EQUIPD begins by focusing on the individual, while laying the groundwork for later
intervention at the structural level (i.e., clinic/healthcare system) through subsequent system-wide
implementation. In Phase 1, we will establish a patient engagement panel, elicit primary care providers’
perspectives on the decision aid, and conduct a 2-arm pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the
intervention to test and refine procedures. In Phase 2 we will conduct a fully powered (N=250) RCT and
evaluate facilitators and barriers to system-wide implementation. The primary outcome of EQUIPD is pain
interference (at 6 months); secondary outcomes include depression, NPT use, anxiety, pain catastrophizing,
and patient engagement. To facilitate implementation planning, we will conduct interviews with a purposefully
sampled subset of intervention patients and with clinicians, administrators, and other clinic staff to optimize the
intervention and elucidate critical factors for system-wide implementation. EQUIPD simultaneously addresses
disparities pervasive in pain treatment and challenges related to comorbid pain and depression, by partnering
with and empowering minoritized patients to find safe, effective approaches to chronic pain that best match
their values, preferences, and lifestyles. Moreover, EQUIPD helps to advance the National Pain Strategy by
promoting multi-modal approaches to pain care that is tailored to individual patients’ needs."
10852881,"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) comprise a group of genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous
pathologies commonly characterized by psychiatric impairment. The molecular basis of these
neuropathologies remains poorly understood. Recent whole-genome-sequencing studies revealed that
mutations in genes encoding heterochromatin modifiers are significantly associated with NDDs. This class of
transcriptional regulators is thought to stabilize neural cell identity and function by enforcing heritable silencing
of lineage non-specific genes through epigenetic chromatin modifications. However, since most heterochromatin
modifiers are ubiquitously expressed and lack sequence-specificity, (1) how precise targeting of repressive
chromatin is controlled and (2) how mutations in general heterochromatin modifiers contribute to NDD-
associated neuronal defects remains unclear. To gain experimental traction on these questions, we will examine
the mechanism by which a high-confidence NDD risk gene, ZNF462, recruits the heterochromatin
modifiers EHMT1/2. We will test whether and how ZNF462 restricts lineage non-specific gene expression
and maintains neural cell identity. ZNF462 haploinsufficiency causes Weiss-Kruszka syndrome, a complex
NDD characterized by neurodevelopmental defects including developmental delay and autism. However, the
neurodevelopmental role of the C2H2 zinc finger protein is unknown. We previously discovered that mouse
Zfp462, is required for endodermal gene repression, directing Ehmt1/2-dependent heterochromatin to
transposable element (TE)-derived enhancers in neural progenitor cells. We hypothesize that human ZNF462
controls facultative heterochromatin formation, by specifically restricting non-neural gene expression during
neurogenesis. However, we predict that due to rapid species-specific evolution of TEs, ZNF462 will have
novel human targets and control a distinct gene regulatory network. W e will therefore: (Aim 1) employ neural
differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) coupled to epigenome and transcriptome profiling to
investigate the impact of ZNF462 heterozygosity on maintenance of neural gene expression, (Aim 2) perform
structure-function analysis and functional complementation in mESCs to identify ZNF462 protein domains
responsible for homodimerization, DNA binding and transcriptional repression and (Aim 3) profile CTCF
binding and three-dimensional chromosome conformation in neuroepithelial stem cells (NESCs) to investigate
the impact of ZNF462 heterozygosity on neuro-specific genome architecture. Our proposal provides a path to
novel insight into the molecular mechanism of ZNF462-dependent gene silencing, and enhance our
understanding of the etiology of Weiss-Kruszka syndrome. The following strategy will reveal new concepts in
gene regulation and neurobiology and elucidate the link between mutations in heterochromatin modifiers and
NDDs. Overall, our work will inform novel strategies to prevent and treat NDDs arising from epigenetic
dysregulation."
10873719,"ABSTRACT IMAGING CORE
The Imaging Core has been a central component of our COBRE, “Expanding Excellence in Developmental
Biology in Oklahoma” since the beginning of Phase I. Its mission is to provide state-of-the-art imaging
instrumentation, outstanding training programs, and commitment to fair access for researchers throughout
Oklahoma. Throughout Phases I and II, the Imaging Core has enabled COBRE investigators to utilize
sophisticated imaging approaches in the acquisition and analysis of their research data. The Imaging Core
has, in addition, contributed greatly to enhancing imaging infrastructure at OMRF, thereby expanding both
imaging capabilities and their access to all Oklahoma researchers. This contribution will continue through
Phase III. We will continue to support and develop the Imaging Core by providing advanced imaging
technologies to our Pilot Project Investigators and former Phase I and II COBRE Project Leads while moving
the Core towards post-Phase III sustainability. We will accomplish our goals through the following Specific
Aims:
Aim 1. Maintain a state-of-the-art imaging facility. Aim 2. Continue our strategy for advising and training
investigators in using the Imaging Core. Aim 3. Establish a sustainable Core budget.
Aim 4. Sustain methods for reviewing, prioritizing, and supporting projects. Aim 5. Sustain methods for
resolving Core usage disputes. Aim 6. Continue evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the Core. Aim 7.
Make a strategic plan to sustain the Imaging Core beyond COBRE Phase III."
10873723,"ABSTRACT BIOINFORMATICS & PATHWAYS CORE
 The Bioinformatics and Pathways Core (BPC) will support users with bioinformatics analysis of high-
throughput experiments such as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and genomic analyses, and provide statistical support in
both the design and interpretation of experiments. During Phases I and II of this COBRE, BPC support has
helped substantially to increase the competitiveness of Project Lead grant applications, based upon reviewer
feedback. The BPC is led by Dr. Jonathan Wren, a bioinformatician with 19 years of experience and includes a
dedicated Ph.D.-level Statistician and a Bioinformatics Scientist. Our Specific Aims are:
Aim 1: Create a cost-effective resource for high-quality, advanced data analysis services, employing
both fee-for-service and collaborative models. BPC personnel have extensive experience using state-of-
the-art bioinformatics methods, as well as a track record of developing novel analysis methods. We will provide
support for pre-experimental study design, including power analyses and utilize novel bioinformatics and
statistical tools to solve specific biological questions posed by COBRE participants. The Core Director has
developed a number of novel tools, such as software to: 1) Automate the identification and analysis of related
entities of interest (e.g., genes, diseases, phenotypes, etc.) within the published literature; 2) Identify features,
properties and experiments that overlap with genomic regions of interest; 3) Identify and analyze experiments
in public microarray databases like NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) through meta-analysis and 4)
Interpret differentially expressed genes in terms of the correlations between them within public databases.
Aim 2: Provide a set of experienced analysts with a diversity of skills and expertise to accommodate a
variety of future analysis projects. This COBRE has enabled the BPC to develop novel software and to hire
personnel with a set of skills broadly useful to helping biomedical researchers. And, as evidenced by our
collaborative publications during COBRE Phases I and II, we have been successful at using our capabilities to
help others advance their research. Phase III will enable us to establish a self-sustaining institutional Core.
Aim 3: Continue to develop, evaluate, and refine new methods of data analysis and data integration.
The BPC will develop increasingly sophisticated and powerful technologies that evolve with the demands of
scientific investigators. We will improve tracking of resource utilization, advance technologies that improve
online interactivity between the data provided and our analysis of it, help investigators make their data
compliant with FAIR principles, develop methods for evaluating network-based data cohesion, and advance
machine-learning methods for common image analysis tasks."
10873729,"ABSTRACT PILOT PROJECTS PROGRAM
Both Phases I and II of this Developmental Biology COBRE included Pilot Project components. The primary
focus of the Pilot Project component was to support early-stage investigators in establishing new projects that
could attract future R01-level funding and that would enhance Developmental Biology capacity in Oklahoma.
The Phase I and II Pilot Programs were successful in helping investigators launch Developmental Biology
research projects that were ultimately funded by larger research grants. In Phase III, the Pilot Program will
continue and will be expanded. Investigators at all career stages will be eligible to receive these funds to
establish new research programs that will add to the Developmental Biology infrastructure established in
Phases I and II. The Aims of the Phase III Pilot Project Program are listed below.
Aim 1. Solicit, review, and select Pilot Project proposals. We describe protocols for the solicitation of Pilot
Project proposals from investigators who are wishing to initiate new Developmental Biology research projects.
We present eligibility considerations, steps of the review process, and criteria for selection to be awarded a
Pilot Project grant.
Aim 2. Evaluate progress of Pilot Projects. We present strategies by which mentoring faculty, a Steering
Committee, and the External Advisory Committee will work together to monitor the progress of the Pilot
Projects.
Aim 3. Provide Pilot Projects with research resources. The Pilot Project Program will provide funds for
conducting Pilot Projects and will also subsidize access to research cores that will offer advanced imaging and
bioinformatics opportunities to Pilot Project Investigators.
Aim 4. Provide Pilot Project Investigators with mentoring and research feedback. We present plans to
provide mentoring to Pilot Project awardees who are in the early stages of their careers in multiple aspects of
career development, including rigorous, ethical, and reproducible research, grantsmanship, personnel and
fiscal management, and the presentation of results. In addition, for both early-stage and established Pilot
Project Leads, we will provide a platform for science-based feedback on Pilot Project research programs."
10932103,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) involving interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and cis-
regulatory elements (CREs) are central to most biological processes. Research in my laboratory aims to
characterize the structure and logic of human GRNs with the ultimate goal of devising therapeutic
strategies. Current gaps in our understanding of GRNs include: determining how TF combinations provide
transcriptional specificity, determining how GRNs are rewired in response to environmental cues and
pathogens, and designing strategies to manipulate GRNs to modulate biological outcomes. Cytokines
present an archetype model to study GRNs because cytokines genes are highly regulated at the
transcriptional level in different cell types and stimulation conditions. We have recently delineated a large-
scale cytokine GRN by determining the binding of individual TFs to cytokine promoter regions and
integrating with expression datasets. Here, we will expand these studies to identify the role of
heterodimeric TFs in cytokine regulation by integrating TF-wide screens using a novel heterodimer yeast
one-hybrid approach we developed, and multi-CUT&tag to profile TF heterodimer binding genome-wide.
This will identify the rules by which heterodimers confer transcriptional specificity and will provide targets
for modulation of cytokine expression in disease. Viruses can rewire or leverage host GRNs for productive
viral replication and to evade immune responses. Given the coexistence of viral genomes and host TFs
and host genomes and viral TF within infected cells, this provides the opportunity for viral-host cross-
transcriptional regulation. For example, CREs of DNA viruses and retroviruses can bind host TFs to
regulate viral gene expression in the appropriate cell types and states to promote viral replication or
latency. We will identify the viral CREs from dsDNA viruses and retroviruses that are active in different cell
types and activation states using high-throughput reporter assays, as well as the human TFs that regulate
these viral CREs. Viral TFs can bind to host CREs to modulate the expression of host genes to promote
cell proliferation, metabolic changes, and immune suppression. We will continue to characterize the
function of viral TFs including identifying targets, transcriptional activity, protein-protein interactions, and
changes in transcriptional programs. Altogether, the proposed studies will identify general principles and
generate a framework to study and manipulate immune GRNs, and will identify mechanisms by which
viruses control host GRNs to replicate and evade immune responses."

In the United States (US), HIV prevalence among transgender women (TW) is high (~14%). Yet, uptake of HIV
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among TW is low (5-20% of US TW report ever using PrEP) and adherence is
often poor. This is in large part because TW were poorly represented in PrEP trials, leading to data quality issues,
and gaps in knowledge about TW's experiences with PrEP. Our previous studies and other literature found that
TW are unwilling to use biomedical HIV prevention strategies unless they have been tested for safety, tolerability,
and efficacy with TW. HIV vaccines are a promising alternative or companion to PrEP, since vaccines would not
require long-term, near-perfect adherence to a daily or bi-monthly product. However, it is currently impossible to
evaluate HIV vaccine candidates for safety, tolerability, and efficacy among TW, since TW represent <2% of HIV
vaccine trials participants. This dearth of data on TW is likely to limit, or preclude, the uptake of a future approved
HIV vaccine in the population that may benefit the most from it. Further, given TW's sensitivity to data
quantity/quality, it is likely that the lack of early trials data about them impedes their willingness to enroll in other
HIV vaccine trials phases. Thus, to increase TW's participation across all phases of HIV vaccine trials, we must
first focus on increasing their recruitment and enrollment in Phase 1 trials. Recruiting and enrolling more TW in
Phase 1 will generate more meaningful safety data on this population, which can be used to promote TW's
participation in subsequent phases. Unfortunately, TW face multiple social and structural barriers to HIV vaccine
trials participation, including stigma, discrimination, and transphobia (among others), all of which require large
sociocultural changes to address. However, our formative work found a lack of tailored communication is also a
critical, and more proximal, barrier to HIV vaccine trials engagement. For example, current efforts do not provide
sufficient information on topics of concern to TW, nor do they offer information in a way that resonates with them.
To intervene on this, we propose “VaxCom” a digital health communication tool to facilitate recruitment and
enrollment of TW in Phase 1 HIV vaccine trials. We hypothesize VaxCom will improve recruitment and enrollment
of TW into Phase 1 HIV vaccine trials by supporting discussions between recruitment and enrollment (R&E)
specialists and TW regarding HIV vaccine questions/concerns, Phase 1 trials participation, and by providing
relevant associated information to TW in a meaningful and tailored way. To develop VaxCom, we will first elicit
TW's and R&E specialists' information needs and preferences for VaxCom. We will then incorporate them into
an initial prototype of VaxCom that we further develop/refine alongside TW and R&E specialists through an
iterative participatory design process. The resulting prototype will be evaluated for feasibility, acceptability,
usability, and potential for success via simulated recruitment and enrollment sessions. The final product of this
R21 will be an alpha prototype of VaxCom, which will be ready for pilot-testing in a future, R34-funded RCT."

The Michigan Institute for Clinical & Health Research (MICHR) career development programs have provided
innovative and impactful clinical and translational research training and support to more than 90 diverse
multidisciplinary scientists since 2017 who have continued on to make important scientific discoveries. Over
the past 15 years our alumni have authored more than 3300 scientific papers that have generated more than
53,000 social media remarks and been included in 240 policy documents. They have also received more than
$400M in research grant support. Our scholars have emerged as translational science leaders and influential
mentors for those following their path as they lead translational research programs at the national level. Their
efforts have contributed to solving some of the nation's most vexing health challenges ranging from basic drug
and genomic discovery to policy research addressing health disparities and the opioid crisis. MICHR's K12
program is continually strengthened through our robust evaluation platform, which integrates critical feedback
from multiple stakeholder groups to implement new competency-based educational initiatives. Our outstanding
program faculty, all of which have undergone mentor training, welcome our K12 scholars into their highly
successful research programs (more than $90M in extramural funds). The new MICHR K12 program will
support 11 scholars annually, who are at a senior postdoctoral fellow or early faculty level, by providing new
programmatic initiatives to support institutional transformation regarding the often invisible but pervasive
patterns that disproportionately alter careers for those underrepresented in their fields (i.e., the hidden
curriculum). Through the following areas of thematic focus, we will support each K12 scholar for two to three
years as they work to gain translational research independence during their time in our program: 1) Fortify
career trajectories with precision preparation in translational science and research; 2) Accelerate translation by
preparing scholars to best utilize scientific social networks; 3) Prepare scholars to be versatile communicators
who lead effective research teams and become science advocates. Our expected outcome is a K12 program
that better prepares and equips scholars for long-term successes in conducting translational research and
science, particularly after leaving our program as they secure external research support. Moreover, these
efforts will motivate change in pervasive patterns that can alter scholars' long-term success as they work to
become translational science leaders in their fields. These efforts will also allow us to continue MICHR's legacy
of building strong leaders within diverse research scientific communities that impact human health."
10831468,"Abstract
 Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common adult neuroinfection in sub-Saharan Africa and causes ~15%
of AIDS-related mortality globally. In the weeks prior to onset of meningitis, cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) is
detectable in the blood, and is a predictor of meningitis and death. CrAg screening in plasma is an effective
public health strategy to identify persons with CD4<200 cells/mcL at high risk of meningitis and death. In a
randomized trial of 2000 persons with HIV, CrAg screening and preemptive fluconazole treatment yielded a
28% survival benefit over standard-of-care. As a result, the World Health Organization and U.S. guidelines
recommend CrAg screening. Yet despite the survival benefit seen with CrAg screening and preemptive
therapy, 25% of initially asymptomatic CrAg+ persons treated with fluconazole still die, even with HIV therapy.
 From 4 prospective cohort studies of CrAg+ persons in Africa, we have determined that as plasma CrAg
titer increases, mortality increases, despite fluconazole therapy. Among asymptomatic CrAg+ persons,
disseminated cryptococcosis is the most commonly identified cause of death. We posit that subclinical
disseminated early neuroinfection in the brain parenchyma accompanies high CrAg titers, and fluconazole is
inadequate therapy. More effective treatment is critically needed to reduce mortality in CrAg+ persons.
 For symptomatic cryptococcal meningitis, amphotericin B is the most effective antifungal; fluconazole alone
is inadequate. Recent randomized trial data reported single dose of liposomal amphotericin (AmBisome) 10 mg
/kg with flucytosine (5FC) and fluconazole is as effective and less toxic than the traditional 7-day amphotericin
+ 5FC for meningitis. We hypothesize that AmBisome (10mg/kg x1), when combined with fluconazole, will be
more effective than fluconazole monotherapy for asymptomatic CrAg+ persons. We have enrolled 244 CrAg+
persons in the initial phase II of a phase II/III randomized trial to demonstrate safety and feasibility of this
enhanced regimen in Uganda, and now we seek to complete the phase III trial in order to test efficacy.
 The objective of this application is to assess the efficacy of AmBisome plus fluconazole to prevent
cryptococcal meningitis and death. We will complete a randomized clinical trial of 600 CrAg+ persons (i.e. 356
more participants) to determine if preemptive therapy with AmBisome (10mg/kg x1) plus fluconazole for CrAg+
persons will improve cryptococcal meningitis-free 6-month survival compared with the current standard of
fluconazole monotherapy (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will determine if neurocognitive outcomes in CrAg+ persons
preemptively treated with AmBisome with fluconazole are superior to outcomes with fluconazole monotherapy.
Finally, in Aim 3 we will evaluate the cost and cost-effectiveness of AmBisome with fluconazole preemptive
treatment in CrAg+ persons. Findings from this trial will impact U.S. and international HIV guidelines on the
optimal prevention of cryptococcal meningitis, in order to reduce mortality in persons living with HIV."

The Cancer Epidemiology and Population Science (CEPS) research program focuses primarily on cancer in 
Iowa, the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center (HCCC) catchment area, while recognizing that its impact 
extends well beyond the state. The primary goal of the CEPS is to conduct population-based research that 
improves our understanding of cancer etiology, morbidity, and mortality in order to explore interventions for 
reducing cancer incidence and mortality and improving quality of life for cancer survivors. This is accomplished 
through three related research aims centered on 1) cancer etiology, 2) primary and secondary cancer 
prevention and 3) cancer health care services and outcomes. Recent influential CEPS publications have 
addressed lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, contralateral breast cancer, pancreatic and breast cancer 
survival, stress, and end-of-life issues, as well as United States Preventive Services Task Force 
recommendations for cancer prevention and screening. CEPS membership includes 28 full and nine associate 
members spanning 17 departments across five colleges. Annual total direct funding for peer-reviewed research 
in the last budget year was $4.3 million with $1.5 million from the NCI. CEPS members are highly productive, 
having authored or co-authored 372 cancer-related peer-reviewed publications since 2016, and highly 
collaborative, with 24% (n=91) intraprogrammatic, 18% (n=70) interprogrammatic, and 63% (n=235) 
interinstitutional publications. Fifty-two of these publications appeared in high impact journals (Impact Factor 
>10). Successful intra/interprogrammatic and multi-institutional collaborations are generating important cancer- 
related advances in knowledge about pesticide and polychlorinated biphenyl exposures; lymphoma, sarcoma, 
and cancers of the breast, ovary, and colorectum; HPV-related cancer and vaccination; multimorbidity science;

10810850,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The menstrual cycle is a marker of physiologic and reproductive health and is tightly controlled by hormone
signals between the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries. The menstrual cycle can be disrupted by
environmental and biological factors that cause hormone dysregulation and ovarian dysfunction. The most
common cause of irregular menses in reproductive-age women is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); hallmark
features include ovarian dysfunction and androgen excess. Women with PCOS also have an increased risk of
developing diabetes, heart disease, obesity, dyslipidemia across their lifespan.
Climate factors, such as temperature, have been shown to affect reproductive function in mammals. Air
pollution (AP) exposure has been associated with accelerated time to pregnancy loss, arrested embryonic
growth in the culture environment, and reduced success of in vitro fertilization. Life course exposures have
differing potential biological mechanisms. Gestational AP exposure has been reported to reduce telomere
length at birth. Assessment of AP exposures and MCC are limited by studies of heterogenous populations with
limited racial/ethnic diversity, incomplete city-level census tract level monitoring, retrospective collection of
cycle history, and lack of MCC and PCOS ascertainment11, 12. We will additionally evaluate life course
exposure to climate factors including temperature and humidity to understand their contribution to MCC
outcomes and risk for PCOS.
We will evaluate cumulative lifetime exposure and life course exposure to AP during the sensitive time
windows of (1) gestation, (2) childhood/premenarche, and (3) adulthood to determine whether prenatal or adult
exposures confer greatest risk. We will additionally evaluate disparities in AP exposures and MCC outcomes in
a SafetyNet hospital population."
10788474,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The opioid crisis remains a major health concern with millions of Americans addicted to opioid drugs and
thousands of opioid related deaths per year. The sad reality is that while medication assisted therapies are highly
effective, relapse rates remain high. More understanding is needed into the neurobiology and circuits of opioid
addiction to identify new therapies. Opioids exert their rewarding and addictive effects through action at the mu
opioid receptor (MOR). The MOR is expressed widely throughout the nervous system including regions
associated with drug reward such as the nucleus accumbens. It is present in a peculiar neuroanatomic
organization referred to as “patch” or “striosome,” with dense regional expression situated in a network of islands
throughout dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens. The region outside of these islands is referred to as matrix.
The functional relevance of this level of neuroanatomic organization is mysterious and its consequence for opioid
use disorders is almost completely unknown. While the direct and indirect pathway of striatal organization has
revealed critical insights into motivated behavior and pathologic changes associated with substance use
disorders, it remains incomplete especially in regions of the ventral striatum such as the nucleus accumbens. The
neuroanatomy of “patch” vs “matrix,” and the cell types contained within each compartment, opens the
possibility for a revived lens through which to look at the functional organization of the nucleus accumbens in
motivated behavior and addiction. Recently, the power of mouse genetics revealed two separate populations of
direct pathway medium spiny neurons housed within MOR positive patch networks. Further work has shown
that while one population encodes positive valence and positive reinforcement, the other encodes negative
valence and negative reinforcement, challenging the traditional dogma of the direct pathway. This proposal
resubmission begins to define a role for these cell populations in preclinical models of opioid abuse, investigating
the properties of patches in the valence of opioids and withdrawal, opioid consumption, maintenance, extinction
and reinstatement. Input and output circuitry will be defined in each patch cell type within the nucleus
accumbens. The work will combine opioid self-administration, behavioral economic analysis, viral
neuroanatomic techniques, optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations and cell type neuroimaging with fiber
photometry. This work will be among the first to study MOR (+) patch circuits in the context of opioid use
disorder. Through this new lens of functional organization, insights can be revealed that could lead to new
therapies in treating the devastating health and societal impact of opioid use disorders."
10884430,"Project Summary/Abstract
In this study I seek to understand how common and rare genetic variation influence the risk of developing
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is a disabling psychiatric disorder with as yet unclear underlying
pathophysiology, which has hindered the development of new treatments and interventions. While there is a
clear genetic contribution to OCD risk, decades of investigations have yet to yield reproducible, statistically
significant findings that identify high-confidence risk genes. In other neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders
(NDDs), including schizophrenia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism, genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) and whole exome sequencing (WES) in large numbers of subjects are now identifying risk genes
and loci, paving the way for novel therapeutics. Increasing sample sizes in OCD, and applying multi-omic
approaches, will lead to similar advances in OCD. Of note, in spite of the advances in NDDs, studies to date
were primarily carried out in samples of European Ancestry (EA), so we know comparatively less about the
genetic architecture of these disorders in non-EA populations. To address these gaps, with the ultimate goal of
studying the role of common and rare deleterious variation in OCD risk, I will work on emerging, large-scale WES
studies in OCD, collaborate in ongoing common variant studies, and collect and analyze Latinx OCD samples.
To achieve these goals, during the K99 phase, I will first be trained on, and make use of, relevant statistical
genetic methods using suitably powered samples of autism and other psychiatric disorders, while building a
Latinx OCD cohort. The R00 phase will focus on meta-analyses of OCD genetic data, including the Latinx cohort,
using well-established pipelines. This will increase power to identify OCD risk genes and loci, and will enable
functional approaches using gene findings to study pathways, cell-types and developmental stages implicated
in OCD risk. Furthermore, since studies of cross-disorder risk are an opportunity to enhance gene discovery by
combining datasets, in the R00 phase shared risk between psychiatric disorders will be leveraged in exploratory
analyses in the OCD gene and locus discovery efforts. Ultimately, I plan to obtain a tenure-track faculty position
and launch a laboratory that focuses on the integration of genetics and neurobiological approaches, to discover
mechanisms underlying NDDs. These efforts will begin with OCD, using genome-wide techniques and leveraging
admixed and diverse populations, and expand into other NDDs. I will also use the K99 phase to deepen
knowledge in writing manuscripts and grants, and to improve skills in presenting complex studies to both mixed
and specialty audiences."
10848126,"This is an application to renew the Stanford Neurosciences graduate program, which leads to the only
neuroscience-specific PhD degree at Stanford University. This interdisciplinary program consists of 88 students
and 84 faculty from 23 departments (10 clinical, 13 basic science/engineering) across 3 schools. The range of
departments illustrates the breadth of research areas, spanning from molecular/cellular to systems and behavior,
human cognition, and translational work. The objective is to identify, recruit, and train predoctoral PhD students
to become the next generation of leaders in neuroscience. Neuroscience and its impact on society greatly benefit
from a diversity of intellectual and personal backgrounds. Thus, faculty receive training on equitable admission
standards, outreach to underrepresented students, and mentorship, and the program supports an active, funded
DEIB (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, & Belonging) committee. The training grant and its implementation are the
foundation of the program, providing a main source of student support for the first two predoctoral years. Stanford
adds considerable value by subsidizing stipends to meet the high cost of living, paid administrative and faculty
support, subsidies for 2 additional years of stipend and tuition, and many scientific and educational resources.
The curriculum is designed to meet NIH standards for excellence in broad-based research training, experimental
design, neural basis of disease, quantitative literacy, statistical methodology, rigor and reproducibility, and
professional skills development. These curricular goals are achieved from day one, when students participate in
an immersive neuroscience course to promote collaboration through active learning and mini-rotations. The first
year provides broad-based learning through core modules that engage students in different ways within
neuroscience subfields (anatomy, cellular, molecular, genetics, developmental, systems, cognitive,
computational) to generate and test hypotheses using modern experimental, quantitative, and technological
approaches. In the journal club, students broadly read the scientific literature, make oral presentations, critique
rigor and statistical methodology, and engage in professional development activities. Students receive formal
training in quantitative approaches, statistical analysis, rigor and reproducibility, and responsible conduct in
research. Students select advanced topic and statistical courses to meet their scientific goals. Research training
is provided by first-year rotations, followed by choice of a thesis lab, passing of an oral qualifying exam, thesis
project, yearly committee meetings, and oral and written defense. Students receive mentoring from first-year
advisors, thesis advisors, committee members, and peers. Program directors meet regularly with each student
cohort and hold town hall meetings. Leadership is encouraged through student-run initiatives such as the annual
retreat, teaching opportunities in courses and summer programs, outreach to local schools, and participation
with faculty in committees for admissions, mental health, DEIB, and curriculum."

The U.S. faces a relentlessly growing syphilis epidemic that is concentrated among men who have sex with
men (MSM) and transgender (TG) persons. We confront that epidemic with diagnostic tools that have barely
changed in over half a century as we continue to rely on serological tests that have a window period from
infection to test positivity of 3-5 weeks. This application proposes studies that will use a new, industry-
developed experimental transcription mediated amplification (TMA) assay for Treponema pallidum (Tp) both to
improve our understanding of the natural history of syphilis, and to assess whether adding TMA testing to
serological screening can identify seronegative persons with syphilis in the earliest stage of infection, before
serological tests become positive. Our preliminary data suggest that 10% of MSM with syphilis are
seronegative, but TMA positive in pharyngeal or rectal specimens. This application builds on that finding. We
will initially define the optimal specimen types for TMA testing among persons with active syphilis by comparing
TMA positivity in pharyngeal vs. oropharyngeal specimens, and in whole blood vs. serum (Aim 1). Throughout
the project, we will test remnant serum, rectal and pharyngeal specimens collected from STD clinic patients
diagnosed with syphilis to define how often Tp RNA is present at different anatomic sites in persons with
different stages of infection (Aim 2). Finally, we will enroll 3350 MSM and TG STD clinic patients in a
prospective study to determine whether adding Tp TMA testing of blood, pharyngeal and rectal specimens
leads to earlier identification of syphilis in persons with negative serological tests (Aim 3). For this aim, we will
enroll seronegative patients without clinical evidence of syphilis. Participants will receive standard clinical
evaluation and treatment at enrollment and will provide the study with serum, rectal and pharyngeal
specimens, which the research team will freeze. Twelve weeks after enrollment, we will test these specimens
using the TMA, and will contact persons with positive TMA results for interview and repeat serological and
TMA testing in order to determine if study subjects developed syphilis or seroconverted since enrollment.
Findings from these studies will define how often persons with different stages of syphilis are likely
transmissible, and will determine whether screening that integrates serology with TMA testing is superior to
standard serological testing alone."

Lower respiratory tract viral infections serve as the dominant trigger for the onset and progression of asthma.
Although asthma management has shifted towards targeting airway inflammation at all levels of the disease,
primarily with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and biologic therapies targeting type-2 (T2) inflammation, there is a
substantial burden of disease that is not responsive to these therapies. Specifically, a substantial portion of
individuals treated with ICS therapy have persistent T2 inflammation in their lower airways and a large and
growing portion of individuals with asthma have inflammation of the airways that is not T2 predominant (non-
T2). These related phenomena of persistent T2 (T2-high) and non-T2 inflammation in asthma are emerging as
the most common phenotypes in adults, and now make up a substantial portion of children with the disease.
The mechanisms responsible for persistent T2 and non-T2 inflammation are incompletely understood, but
there is strong evidence that the epithelium and epithelial-derived cytokines play a major role in the
immunology of asthma, and we have recently demonstrated that the epithelium is infiltrated with specific innate
immune cells that interact with the epithelium to propagate and regulate inflammation. Our central hypothesis
is that the airway epithelium serves as a central coordinator of the immune response to viral
respiratory tract infection in asthma. Further, airway epithelial cells (AECs) from T2-high and non-T2
individuals differentially interact with immune cells to support inflammation in a manner that can be
identified and targeted. We have an established program to isolate AECs from children and adults to
examine the function of these cells in asthma using a combination of organotypic cell culture models, often in
combination with immune cells. The primary goals of the Seattle Center are to identify primary alterations in
AECs in asthma, understand how AECs differ between T2-high and non-T2 individuals, and characterize
interactions between the epithelium and immune cells that are in close proximity. In Project 1, we examine the
underpinnings of persistent T2 inflammation mediated through mast cells and eosinophils acting in conjunction
with the epithelium and the components of this inflammation that are resistant to corticosteroids. In Project 2,
we examine the basis of interactions between the epithelium and macrophages, Th17 cells, and neutrophils
and how epithelial cells from each of the groups support inflammation through these cells. These projects are
supported by Pediatric and Adult Epithelial Cores (Core B) to isolate AECs from well phenotyped adults and
children and further examine connections between phenotype, genomics, genotype, and clinical outcome. The
studies are supported by an Advanced Bioinformatics Core (Core C) using state of the art single cell and
bulk RNA sequencing. These studies will facilitate the precise targeting of inflammation based on clinical
phenotype and epithelial endotype and a greater understanding of the basis of interactions between the
epithelium and immune cells that reside within the epithelium in asthma."

Antibiotic-resistant microbial pathogens are a grave and urgent threat to public health. With rising rates of drug-
resistant infections and a diminishing arsenal of new antibiotic treatments, there is pressing need for
approaches to better understand, predict, and prevent the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To
this end, experimental evolution approaches, in which microbial organisms are evolved in the laboratory in
user-defined conditions, provide a powerful paradigm to define the evolutionary paths toward AMR. This
approach has illuminated genetic pathways to evolving resistance, and can define factors that can be exploited
to steer toward drug-susceptible states and guide new clinical strategies. However, the potential of this
approach for understanding AMR evolution is fundamentally constrained by technological barriers in
conducting continuous culture and evolution experiments, which requires the following key capacities: 1) Scale
to evolve across a diversity of microbes, experimental conditions, and antibiotics; 2) Automation for frequent
perturbations and feedback over long experimental time scales; 3) Control to reproduce key features of the
mammalian gut environment, a primary site for the evolution of AMR in vivo. All existing tools fail in one or
more of these capacities. And critically, laboratory evolution studies fail to account for how interactions within
bacterial communities impact the evolutionary trajectory, dynamics, and outcomes of AMR. We propose to fill
this technological and experimental void by developing a first-in-class, benchtop technology for scalable,
automated, and controlled microbial evolution studies, and apply it to two pressing problems in AMR. Because
the gut environment is depleted of oxygen (anaerobic), and current technology lacks complete oxygen control,
we will first develop a system for individual control of atmospheric conditions across mini-bioreactors
(atmostat). We will achieve this in the eVOLVER platform, an open-source microbial culture system for
automated control of growth conditions that is easily adapted to new control features, and is exceedingly
scalable. Preliminary results of eVOLVER-atmostat demonstrate unprecedented scale for continuous
culture and evolution of strict anaerobic gut microbes on the benchtop. The first study will determine the
effects of oxygen tension on the mutational fitness landscapes of AMR in E. coli strains. We will implement an
automated antibiotic selection regime in combination with atmostat control of oxygen gradients, and employ
metagenomic sequencing to map the interactions of oxygen, antibiotics, and strains backgrounds in AMR. The
second study will determine how AMR emerges in the ecological context of the gut microbiome, by evolving E.
coli strains with a gut community across multiple antibiotics. Applying state-of-the-art abundance quantification
over time and population genetics approaches, we will define both the ecological and evolutionary landscape
of E. coli in the gut community. Collectively, this work will produce a transformative technology to be used by
researchers worldwide, and begin to reveal how pathogens evolve AMR in the human gut ecosystem."

Candidate: The applicant, Greg Allen, MD/PhD, is a medical oncologist at UCSF with a long-term goal to lead
an independent laboratory-based translational research program focused on cellular therapies. The K08
application is key for his career development, providing him with (1) mentorship from a diverse team of scientists
and physician-scientists, (2) formal didactics to expand his knowledge in clinical trial design and tumor
immunology, (3) extensive hands-on training in the translation of newly developed cellular therapies to early
phase clinical trials and (4) data collection for an R01 application.
Research: CAR T cells are a game-changing treatment for B cell malignancies — genetically reprogramming a
patient's cytotoxic T cells allows them to recognize and clear tumor cells. Unfortunately for solid cancers the
current generation of CAR T cells have been ineffective – no simple single antigen targeted CAR is able to
precisely recognize and safely clear solid tumor cells. There is a clear unmet need for the design and
implementation of the next-generation of engineered cell therapies to overcome these challenges. The core
hypothesis of this proposal is that combinatorial antigen recognition—the detection of tumor cells and tumor
microenvironments using information from multiple antigens (with AND/OR/NOT gates) can provide a powerful
solution to the problem of precise recognition and allow the construction of more effective therapies.
In this project the first aim will investigate the use of AND gates to safely target pancreatic adenocarcinoma by
recognizing and overcoming the suppressive tumor-microenvironment seen in this disease. The second aim
will apply newly developed receptors that provide NOT gate functionality to avoid CNS toxicity seen with CAR T
cells designed to target neuroblastoma.
Mentorship and Training: Dr. Allen's training will be accomplished through formal coursework and under direct
mentorship of world leaders including Wendell Lim, PhD, chair of the Department of Molecular and Cellular
Pharmacology at UCSF who has extensive expertise in modular signaling platforms, synthetic biology and
cellular therapy. Professor Lim has over his 20 years at UCSF mentored ~50 postdoctoral fellow as well as 4
clinical fellows. Dr. Allen will be co-mentored by Dr. Larry Fong, MD, an expert in translational immunology and
immunotherapy who leads the Cancer Immunotherapy Program at UCSF and has extensive experience in
helping translational immunology researchers achieve independence.
Environment: The candidate's training and research will be performed at the University of California, San
Francisco, which provides an exceptional research environment with state-of-art facilities and world-renowned
faculty. UCSF is dedicated to developing next-generation cell therapies and Dr. Allen will be part of the UCSF
Cell Design Institute (focused on cell engineering), the UCSF Center for Synthetic Immunology and the UCSF
Helen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center."
10806943,"Project Summary/Abstract
The proposed research will characterize the prevalence and management strategies of gastric intestinal
metaplasia (GIM), a lesion of the digestive tract that affects about 12.1 million adults in the United States (US)
and is a precursor to gastric adenocarcinoma, or gastric cancer (GC). While mass surveillance of GIM is
unlikely to be effective in regions of low-prevalence for GC such as the US, we hypothesize that risk-
stratification for targeted screening and surveillance will be cost-effective and can improve outcomes.
Extensive GIM has been identified by gastrointestinal society guidelines as a major risk factor for progression
to GC, but there is currently a dearth of evidence in understanding the prevalence of GIM overall and by
subtype (limited and extensive) in the US population, or how it should be managed. Furthermore, the recently
proposed guidelines from the American Gastroenterological Association suggest surveillance of GIM should be
considered in racial/ethnic minorities, foreign-born individuals, or those with a history of Helicobacter pylori (H.
pylori) infection; however, evidence on the threshold to initiate such interventions and the intervals at which
they should be continued is lacking. The research proposed in this K08 application will accomplish three
interrelated Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will utilize data from across the Veterans Affairs health care system to
characterize the prevalence of subtypes of GIM and risk factors for progression of GIM to dysplasia or
malignancy in the US context. These data will provide a platform for Aim 2, in which we will build a simulation
model of the natural history of progression from precancerous gastric lesions to GC to assess which individual-
level risk factor profiles could benefit most from screening and surveillance of GIM. The model will utilize 64
different phenotypic profiles, stratified by: gender (male/female), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, Hispanic,
black, and Asian), extent of GIM (limited vs. extensive), foreign-born status (immigrant vs. US-born), and H.
pylori infection status (previous/current infection vs. no infection). Outcomes will be reported based on number
of cancers prevented, survival, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Once an optimal profile and
screening regimen is identified on the patient level, in Aim 3 we will assess the population-level impact of
implementing such a strategy on health care outcomes and costs in the US. The long window of progression
from GIM to malignancy and the low incidence of GC make sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials
difficult. Simulation modeling allows for the integration of available knowledge to test multiple surveillance
regimens of GIM across a broad range of risk factor combinations, which would not be feasible in clinical
studies. By award period end, the proposed research will utilize national pathology data coupled with
simulation modeling to identify a specific subgroup of high-risk patients that may benefit most from surveillance
in the US. The proposal, mentorship and advisory committee, career development plans and institutional
support will lay the basis for an independent NIH-funded career."
10817000,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The functions of the liver, including detoxification, synthesis of serum proteins, and bile production, critically
depend on hepatocyte polarization and bile canaliculus (BC) formation. Defects in these processes are
associated with serious liver diseases such as cholestasis and hepatocarcinoma. Using the rat hepatocyte
line Can 10, the only known cells that can proliferate and form “tubular” BCs (tBCs) in vitro that resembles
those in vivo, we discovered that hepatocyte polarization and “primordial” BC formation are linked to
cytokinesis. This division-linked mechanism also applies to BC biogenesis during liver development.
However, it remains a mystery how a primordial BC formed between two daughter cells at the division site is
remodeled and grown into a tBC nestled between two rows of cells, as seen in the liver.
We hypothesize that tBC formation involves spatiotemporal coordination of oriented divisions, with BC
expansion driven by targeted exocytosis, elongation by pushing forces from both sides of the BC, and
extension along the cell-cell contact through constant remodeling of the adherens and tight junctions. To
identify the steps and key players involved, we employed two non-biased approaches. The first involves
identification of genes from single-cell transcriptomic analysis of liver development that are induced or
increased at stages of hepatocyte polarization and BC formation. The second involves identification of
genes whose expressions are increased in the polarized Can 10 cells versus the unpolarized parental cells.
These complementary approaches have led to the discovery of numerous genes that may play an important
role in a process from the terminal stage of cytokinesis to tBC formation. 11 candidate genes were selected
for a small siRNA-based screen, three (KIF21B, ABLIM3, and IPCEF1) were found to be required for tBC
formation. None of these has been implicated previously in epithelial tube formation. In this application, we
will use an interdisciplinary approach to test our hypotheses that the microtubule (MT) plus end-directed
motor Kif21B and the actin-binding protein Ablim3 act in concert to drive BC expansion by controlling MT-
and actin-mediated vesicle transport as well as adherens junction (AJ) assembly (Aim 1), and that the
scaffold protein Ipcef1 promotes Arf6 activation by distinct cytohesins (GEFs) at distinct locations to control
AJ remodeling, apical vesicle recycling, and actin-based protrusions to drive BC elongation (Aim 2). As the
mechanisms of apical tube formation are highly conserved from worms to humans, the impact of our
proposed study will likely reach far beyond the field of liver biology."
10818332,"ABSTRACT
As the brain matures, each neuronal cell type must execute a specialized developmental program to build a cell
with the appropriate features. These programs are composed of waves of gene expression that turn on and off
with exquisite precision as the cell goes through sequential developmental stages. In fact, failure of these pro-
grams to unfold correctly is linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders. Modern transcriptomics has allowed
us to map developmental trajectories of different neuronal subtypes at increasingly high resolution. However,
this information alone is not sufficient. In fact, layers of sophisticated post-transcriptional regulation of gene ex-
pression by microRNAs (miRNA) help execute these incredibly complex developmental programs. MiRNAs act
as post-transcriptional repressors, ensuring that their mRNA targets are not expressed at an inappropriate time
or place. We and others demonstrated that removal of a single brain-enriched miRNA can have profound con-
sequences for brain development, but because each miRNA represses hundreds of different targets, it is hard
to pinpoint precise molecular mechanisms. In light of this information, it is necessary to radically change the way
we study miRNAs. Here, we propose two novel strategies that do not focus on single miRNAs and are designed
to immediately identify molecular mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The first
approach is based on the fact that, at times, de-repression of a single miRNA-target interaction (MTI) can be
sufficient to induce a phenotype. Hence, in Aim 1 we establish a pipeline to perform a large-scale test of all MTIs
in excitatory principal neurons (PN), independently of which miRNA is binding to them, to identify which ones
are critical for their development. To do so, we engineered tools to map and manipulate cell type-specific MTIs,
and fluorescent reporters that function as fast readouts of the developmental stage of PNs. The second approach
takes advantage of the fact that, often, multiple miRNAs converge on the same target to ensure tight regulation.
If evolution imposed multiple layers of repression on the same target, then controlling its protein levels must be
essential to maintain the proper developmental trajectory. Thus, in Aim 2 we establish a pipeline to identify the
targets most heavily repressed by miRNAs and study the functional consequences of their complete de-repres-
sion on the developmental trajectory of PNs. For both aims, we propose to investigate how de-repression of a
single MTI or of a single miRNA target affects the structure, function, and connectivity of developing cortical PNs
both in vitro and in vivo. With this proposal we expect to greatly expand our understanding of broad post-tran-
scriptional mechanisms of PN development, both at single MTI resolution and at the level of single target re-
pressed by many miRNAs. Such knowledge will be key not only for basic neurobiology, but also to identify how
failure in miRNA repression could lead to neurodevelopmental disorders."
10838531,"Summary
The efficacy of DNA damaging cancer therapies is determined by the (i) intrinsic DNA repair
capacity of cancer cells, and (ii) immune responses to signals emanating from tumors.
Understanding the molecular basis of communication between the DNA damage and immune
responses is therefore a central issue to both cancer etiology and therapy. We reported that
mitotic progression after DNA damage allows cGAS-STING dependent pattern recognition of
DNA in micronuclei to initiate interferon-stimulated gene expression and T-cell dependent
eradication of distant metastases. Disruption of DNA damage induced cell cycle checkpoints
together with p53 mutation resulted in pattern recognition receptor responses by both DNA and
RNA sensors, including the cGAS-STING and the MDA5 and RIG-I/MAVs pathways. Our
unpublished findings reveal additional complexity to these responses. NLRP9 inflammasome
assembly is increased in chromosomally instable cancer cells and opposes interferon stimulated
responses. Interestingly, NLRP9 deficiency delayed tumor formation in a murine Brca2 mutant
high grade serous ovarian cancer model commensurate with reversal of an immune
suppressive tumor microenvironment. These findings potentially explain how DNA damage can
either activate or suppress anti-tumor immune responses.
This proposal will take cellular, biochemical, and in vivo approaches to test hypotheses that
chromosome instability activates dichotomous inflammatory signaling responses that
differentially affect tumor growth. The importance of these mechanisms to cancer
immunotherapy will be tested in syngeneic tumor models that assess systemic anti-tumor
immune responses to combinations of DNA damaging therapies and immune checkpoint
blockade. Collaborations with Projects 2 and 3, and with the Mammalian Artificial Chromosome
and Chemical Biology Cores will be instrumental to these studies."

Aged-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex disease and the leading cause of
blindness among the elderly. Dry AMD has unclear etiology and no treatment. Lipid-rich drusen
deposits are the silent hallmark of dry AMD. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is likely to be
the primary lesion site of AMD. Lacking an AMD mouse model is a roadblock to advance this
research field. Recently we showed that RPE-specific CLIC4 knockout (KO) mice develop a full
spectrum of AMD-like pathophysiology, including the impaired visual function, the drusen-like
deposition, and severe RPE cell loss. CLIC4 is a redox-sensing pleiotropic protein. Our
characterizations showed CLIC4 deficiency alters a myriad of signaling pathways that are
required for maintaining RPE homeostasis. In particular, CLIC4-KO RPE cells had profound lipid
dysregulation. We proposed two specific aims to understand CLIC4's role in coupling several
aspects of the lipid homeostasis-metabolism, storage, and transport. We will investigate the lipid
homeostasis of the RPE in the context of cell biology. The overarching goal is to learn how
integrated outcomes as a consequence of loss-of-CLIC4 present the AMD-like pathophysiology.
We will investigate CLIC4’s role in the phospholipid (Aim1) and sphingolipid (Aim2) homeostasis
of RPE (Aim1) in the aspects of the lipid metabolism, storage, and transport. We will use
interdisciplinary approaches and state-of-the-art techniques (e.g., Imaging Mass Spectrometry-
LC/MS-MS lipidomics, transcriptomes, 3D electron microscopy) to studies these questions both
in vivo and in vitro. The obtained information will significantly advance our comprehension of the
basic science of the RPE and AMD etiology. They also have a strong potential for discovering
new drug targets to treat AMD."
10862568,"Project Summary and Relevance
At least 1 in 50 adults in the US harbor an intracranial aneurysm (IA), a pathological outpouching of a brain
artery. Even with improvements in clinical management, IA rupture is fatal for approximately 45% of patients and
50% of survivors suffer from disabilities that prevent them from returning to a normal life. Treatment to prevent
rupture strives to shield the wall from blood pressure induced loads by mechanically clipping the IA neck during
open brain surgery or by inducing thrombosis using endovascular coiling or stent implantation. These treatments
have significant risks of complications that can be higher than the natural rupture risk, including 1-2% risk of
mortality. Since the risk of treatment may exceed the natural risk of rupture, there is an urgent need for a reliable
method to identify fragile aneurysms at risk of rupture that require immediate treatment and avoid unnecessary
treatment in others.
The clinical focus of this project is aneurysms that have focal areas of growth (blebs) as these IA have
high clinical prevalence (approximately 30%) and are a known risk factor for rupture. Despite this clinical
importance, very little is known about why blebs form nor the actual mechanisms by which blebs increase rupture
risk. Our prior work demonstrates that aneurysms with blebs can have different wall structures and failure
mechanisms than other aneurysms. Even within this subgroup, there are a wide range of wall types and risk
factors. Current clinical practice does not distinguish between different types of blebs or their failure modes and
treats all blebs equally.
The proposed research is innovative because it seeks to change this common clinical approach for aneurysm
evaluation where all blebs are treated as a single group. Furthermore, our research is also innovative because
it changes the way aneurysms are studied by focusing directly on the vulnerability of the aneurysm wall and its
failure modes instead of searching for correlations between different factors and aneurysm rupture.
The goal of this project is to improve risk assessment by identifying clinically measurable features that
predispose some IAs to bleb formation and then determine which walls features determine rupture risk in these
IAs. Specifically, the goals of this project are to i) Identify aneurysms that are at risk for developing blebs, ii)
Determine causes for wall vulnerability in aneurysms with blebs, iii) Understand the connection between dental
pathogens and IA wall vulnerability. We will achieve these objectives using a multi-faceted approach that
combines bioimaging and mechanical testing of human aneurysm tissue with in silico patient specific modeling
of the blood flow inside the aneurysms and stresses within the aneurysm wall. We will leverage our multi-
disciplinary team of world leaders in the field of cerebral aneurysms which includes seven neurosurgeons and
experts in patient specific CFD modeling, computational biomechanics, biology of the IA wall, bioimaging and
mechanical testing of soft tissues.
The rationale for the proposed research is that by recognizing IAs with blebs as a distinct group with different
causes for formation and rupture, we will improve risk assessment and can target patient treatment. Furthermore,
by identifying modifiable risk factors that are associated with bleb formation (e.g. dental pathogens), we can
initiate preventative treatment for IAs. At the successful completion of this research program we will have i)
identified risk factors for bleb formation (an early indication of risk), ii) direct causes for increased rupture risk in
blebs, and iii) determined how dental pathogens affect the wall structure and association with measurable patient
factors. These results are expected to have a positive impact on human health because they will improve risk
assessment in IAs, provide targets for drug therapy and identify preventative approaches for IA treatment."

 This K23 resubmission is for Dr. Bubu, an Assistant Professor at NYU School of Medicine (NYUSoM), in the
Departments of Psychiatry and Population Health, who is fully committed to becoming an independently funded investigator studying how age-related and age-dependent sleep changes, and vascular risk, impact cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk, and how they drive AD related disparities. His unique background makes him an ideal candidate for this field of research. Dr. Bubu has graduate, internship, and fellowship-level clinical and research training in neurology, neuro-epidemiology and public health. He is a graduate of the NYU’s NIH-funded Program to provide Congruent Mentorship to Reach Academic Diversity in Neuroscience Research (1R25NS094093-01), and was recently supported as a postdoctoral fellow at NYUSoM Department of Population Health under a T32 funding mechanism (T32HL129953). He was recently awarded the NIA funded Columbia Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Alzheimer’s disease Disparities Pilot (CIRAD; P30 AG059303) grant to conduct original research on the interaction of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and race on plasma tau, and neurofilament light protein.
Career development and training plan: Dr. Bubu’s training plan in health disparities research and MRI/PET data analysis
couples an outstanding research and education environment at NYUSoM and nearby world-renowned medical centers in the New York Manhattan area with nationally renowned expert mentors. His advisory committee is comprised of Drs. Jean-Louis (primary mentor and expert in health disparity research at NYU), Osorio (co-primary mentor and expert in healthy brain aging and neurodegeneration, at NYU), Ayappa (co-mentor and expert in sleep/OSA physiology, at Mount Sinai), Ogedegbe (adviser and expert in CVD disparity research at NYU), de Leon (adviser and expert in AD neuroimaging and biomarkers at Weill Cornell), and Manly (consultant and expert in neuropsychological methods in underserved populations at Columbia). His training plan features carefully designed coursework and hands-on training experiences.
Research plan: Slow wave sleep (SWS) and vascular risk are associated with AD risk. Black/African-American older
adults are disproportionately affected by Alzheimer’s disease, have significantly less SWS duration and higher prevalence of vascular risk factors (VRFs) for Alzheimer’s disease, compared to whites. In addition, sleep problems and VRFs often co-occur. More importantly, identifying asymptomatic blacks at higher risk of cognitive decline from Alzheimer’s disease is crucial to preventing its onset among blacks. Dr. Bubu’s research proposal focuses on both cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships (Aims 1 -3) of the mediating role of SWS and VRFs on AD related disparity between blacks and on-Hispanic whites. This proposal represents new, original, and hypothesis-driven work with a strong theoretical foundation. It is expected that each Aim will result in published manuscripts and data, which will directly inform and shape future R01-applications. This training and research plan will enable Dr. Bubu to become an independent researcher and leader in the impact of health behaviors, specifically sleep and VRFs on late-life cognitive functioning in blacks."

Inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) is causally associated with the pathogenesis and
progression of multiple demyelinating and neurodegenerative diseases, including Multiple Sclerosis (MS),
Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and general age-associated
cognitive decline Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel approaches to prevent, limit or reverse
neuroinflammation. Basic, translation and clinical studies indicate that T cells can be major drivers of
inflammation in the CNS, but the mechanisms promoting or inhibiting these responses remain poorly defined.
The fundamental focus of this research proposal is to: (i) interrogate a novel pathway by which the
innate immune system controls T cell responses in the CNS, (ii) understand the regulation of these
cellular interactions, and (iii) define whether it is possible to harness this or related pathways for
therapeutic benefit in neuroinflammation. We will employ innovative approaches and develop new tools to
address these fundamental gaps in knowledge, and where possible, translate our findings from mice into
clinically defined patient samples. Results from these studies will advance our understanding of the
pathways that promote or inhibit pro-inflammatory T cell responses in the CNS, and could provoke the
next generation of novel preventative, therapeutic or curative treatment strategies for demyelinating
and neurodegenerative diseases."

Most human health traits are highly complex and hierarchical, in which a high-level trait (e.g., energy expenditure)
is the product of the combined effects of a suite of sub-phenotypes. These trait hierarchies are typically
influenced by many genetic variants of small effect that interact with one another and with environmental factors,
making the identification of the causative variants a significant challenge. As a result, past research strategies
have largely failed to fully address the complexity of most complex traits, leaving a significant knowledge gap in
our understanding of the genetic basis of these traits. This project will use an innovative combination of a large
multiparent mapping population and experimental evolution using the powerful fruit fly model system to identify
the common mechanistic connections between complex traits and observe how these connections influence
multitrait evolution. First, this project will simultaneously evolve flies targeting multiple trait hierarchies and track
the genomic and phenotypic changes that occur during adaptation. Second, this project will leverage a large
multiparent mapping population that has been used broadly in the genetics community to address fundamental
questions about the generality of emergent properties of the genome, such as the extent of pleiotropy, genotype
by environment interactions, and genetic background effects. Overall, this research will provide generalizable
lessons about how genomes are connected to physiology to produce the interconnected set of traits that affect
health across the lifespan."

Organisms with regenerative abilities have been informative models for uncovering natural
mechanisms by which tissue damage activates stem or progenitor cells for injury repair. Such
systems require not only sources for newly forming differentiated cells and initial responses to
wounding, but also critically, spatial information systems that signal tissue presence/absence in
order to control appropriate regeneration outcomes and restore tissue to its original scale and cell
number. While regenerative tissues have been extensively probed for the roles of injury-induced
signals and the involvement of stem or progenitor cells, much less is known about the molecular
and developmental processes that enable the restoration of form after injury and its maintenance
through adult growth. This grant seeks to understand the factors involved in the early symmetry-
breaking events after injury, the process of establishing and using signaling centers for control of
regenerative growth, the mechanism by which whole-body regeneration can robustly restore
tissue proportionality and restore homeostasis, and identify the control mechanisms used by
progenitor cells in whole body regeneration. The work will compare regeneration mechanisms in
two distantly evolved model systems, the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea and the acoel
Hofstenia miamia, each capable of whole-body regeneration using Piwi-expressing pluripotent
adult stem cells termed neoblasts. Using expression profiling, RNAi screening and spatial
transcriptomics, these studies will reveal what factors and strategies of whole-body regeneration
are ancient and conserved. These approaches will reveal foundational mechanisms used by
organisms to control adult tissue repair, growth, and homeostasis."

Endothelial dysfunction, a pro-thrombotic, inflammatory condition that causes impaired vascular reactivity is an
early reversible step in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Multiple studies
consistently shown that African Americans (AAs) have impaired endothelial function compared to whites.
African Americans also experience disproportionately higher CV morbidity and 20% higher mortality than
whites or Hispanics. Endothelial dysfunction is caused by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species
(ROS), particularly superoxide which interferes with endothelial-derived nitric oxide signaling pathways. One of
the major sources of superoxide is NADPH oxidase; our previous work found that activation of NADPH oxidase
contributes to vascular oxidation through the formation of highly immunogenic isolevuglandins (IsoLG-protein
adducts) in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which stimulates antigen presenting cells (APC) and
inflammatory mediators. Inflammation and oxidative stress are modulated by the parasympathetic nervous
system (PNS). We and others found that AAs have reduced PNS activity compared with whites. Our
preliminary data in obese AA women found that stimulation of the PNS cholinergic transmission with the
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, galantamine, blocked the production of oxidative stress and inflammatory
cytokines induced by lipids. The overall goal of the current proposal is to determine if prolonged treatment with
galantamine improves endothelial dysfunction and vascular oxidative stress in AAs. For this purpose, we will
conduct a proof-of-concept, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study to test the effect of 3-month
treatment with galantamine (16 mg/day) on vascular oxidative stress and impaired vascular reactivity in AAs.
 Specifically, we will evaluate whether galantamine treatment inhibits the activation of NADPH-IsoLG formation
and the subsequent immunogenic responses in PBMCs. Furthermore, we will determine if galantamine
decreases markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in harvested endothelial cells (ECs) and improves
vascular reactivity in the same study subjects. The planned studies will provide a comprehensive assessment
of the mechanism underlying the effect of increased PNS cholinergic transmission on endothelial dysfunction.
If our hypothesis is correct, and galantamine improves endothelial dysfunction in AAs, a population with a high
risk for CVD, we will discover a novel mechanism that could alter the oxidative and immunogenic responses in
this population and will offer a potential pathway for the development of more effective therapies aimed at
decreasing CVD."

Data-driven discovery methods are a novel class of methodologies and computational approaches, revolutionizing the modeling, prediction, and control of complex systems, while remaining scientifically explainable and interpretable. These methods learn governing equations directly from data and have found considerable success in a wide range of applications including turbulence, climate, robotics, and autonomy. However, the first generation of these methods has proven poorly suited to the study of biomedical data. To realize the full potential of data-driven approaches, they must be extended and adapted to deal with the noise, sparsity, and variability intrinsic to experiments with living organisms. My group has extended the seminal Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method to the Weak form SINDy (WSINDy). Weak form equations are a transform of the original data that enables learning of the equations even in the presence of substantial noise and sparsity. The approach effectively recasts scientific discovery from proposing and validating/refuting a single scientific hypothesis to simultaneously proposing (in many cases) more than 10^180 hypotheses and using sparse regressing to prune the hypotheses which are not supported by the data. Moreover, our approach currently takes on the order of minutes on a standard laptop. The overarching goals of this research are to use the WSINDy method to investigate the 1) individual cell-based drivers for collective cell migration and 2) data-driven inference for unobserved processes in infectious disease dynamics as well as 3) extend WSINDy to infer stochastic dynamical systems and discover critical, but hidden, compartments. The first goal continues a long collaboration with Xuedong Liu (CU-Boulder). We have adapted WSINDy to create individualized models of each cell in a migrating colony. We learn the interaction rules and can classify them according to cell type. The plan is to continue expanding the capabilities of WSINDy in this context to hopefully learn the biochemical dynamics unique to each cell. This would be the first coupling of data-driven models for inter- and intra-cell processes. It will lead us closer to understanding how cells make decisions that lead to the emergent collective motion in wound healing. The second goal expands a collaboration with Beth Carlton (an epidemiologist) in infectious disease dynamics centered around the COVID-19 modeling team (of which we are both members). During our efforts to develop a compartmental model for advising the State Epidemiologist and the Governor, several questions arose that could be efficiently answered by extensions to WSINDy. In particular, we will develop data-driven inference for infection and recovery rates as well as the distribution of dwell times in the infection timeline. The last goal involves extensions of WSINDy to learn models for situations that frequently arise in biomedical phenomenon. First, we plan to learn stochastic dynamical systems. Previous efforts were only able to infer either drift term or mean field equations. By recasting WSINDy to evaluate moments of the data, we can learn the stochastic models directly. Lastly, inference regarding unobserved compartments is challenging, but via an extension to WSINDy we plan to discover unobserved variables and their equations."

 As of 2017, coccidioidomycosis (Cocci) also known as Valley Fever (VF) was designated a reportable
disease in 22 states (1). The majority of the cases in the US occur in southern Arizona and California where the
population is increasing with influx of naïve individuals, in particular, elderly retirees. Since Coccidioides sp, can
cause significant morbidity and mortality in fully immunocompetent hosts, this represents an important threat to
these regions where >10% percent of the US population resides, not including substantial tourist or part-time
resident populations in Arizona and California. Importantly, the reporting criteria require a positive laboratory
test for inclusion, yet ~50% of patients–who will eventually test positive–test negative while acutely ill (2). Testing
has low sensitivity and specificity leaving sick patients and their health care providers without an accurate
diagnosis. Thus, there is a profound need for better diagnostic approaches to properly identify Cocci patients to
ensure appropriate follow-up and therapy ensues.
 Coccidioides spp. grow as mycelia in the desert soils and produce spores (arthroconidia) to survive during
times of adverse growth conditions. When this soil is disturbed, arthroconidia aerosolize and are inhaled to
initiate infection. Inside the host, the spores transform into spherules containing endospores which grow in the
lung. When spherules burst, endospores, are released and can each disseminate to form a new spherule.
 Clinical diagnosis is difficult because patients’ symptoms resemble other bacterial and viral pneumonias.
Laboratory diagnosis often relies solely on serology, but ~50% of patients do not test positive while they are
acutely ill which results in inaccurate diagnosis an inappropriate treatment. We propose that it is time for a re-
evaluation of seroreactive coccidioidal antigens. For the past six decades, serologic diagnosis of
coccidioidomycosis has relied on IgM responses to tube precipitin (TP) and IgG responses to complement
fixation (CF) antigens. Since these antigens are primarily expressed in mycelia, not in spherules which is the
fungal form that grows in the host, it is not surprising that many patients are seronegative because they have not
yet generated antibodies to spherule antigens during acute pulmonary illness.
 The GOAL of this proposal is to identify new coccidioidal antigens that react with acutely infected patient
sera. The objectives are to utilize the recently published Coccidioides spp. proteome to create a nucleic acid
programmable protein array (NAPPA) in which every coccidioidal protein is screened for reactivity with VF patient
sera. Our hypothesis is that this survey of the Coccidioides proteome will reveal new spherule-phase antigens
that are reactive with more patients, especially acutely ill patients who are seronegative for TP and/or CF
antigens. Once we identify a small panel of seroreactive antigens, they can be incorporated into existing antigen
preparations or a separate reliable, consistent, accurate test that will increase the number of positive diagnoses
in acutely ill patients with early disease."

Acute lung injury (ALI), clinically known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is a severe and
potentially life-threatening condition with different sub-phenotypes leading to distinct clinical outcomes. In
particular, patients with non-resolving pulmonary inflammation who survive the acute phase of ARDS are a
subpopulation at increased risk for poor outcomes, including long term lung damage and significantly decreased
quality of life. Therefore, developing strategies to monitor ongoing lung inflammation based on inflammatory
signatures (i.e. specific inflammatory mediators and individual immune cell populations) represents a Precision
Medicine approach, especially relevant given the growing development and applications of immunomodulatory
therapies. Molecular imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) is emerging as a promising non-
invasive approach that can used to visualize inflammatory processes and provide prognostic information. Current
PET tracers, primarily 18F-FDG, for lung inflammation suffer from a lack of specificity and poor kinetics. We
propose developing PET tracers targeting the receptor/chemokine ChemR23/chemerin, a newly established
biomarker for imaging lung inflammation. We have designed two classes of PET tracers, an “active” probe
imaging the expression of ChemR23 and an “activatable” probe imaging the inflammatory-protease bioactivation
of the ChemR23-chemerin axis. Our central hypothesis is that modification of the “active” tracer into an
“activatable” tracer through addition of a cleavable C-terminal tail will enhance the specificity of imaging the
ChemR23-chemerin axis by mimicking the local bioactivation and ultimately uptake of chemerin in the
inflammatory environment. We propose two specific aims: SPECIFIC AIM 1: To synthesize and biologically
characterize active and protease-activatable chemerin-derived radiotracers. SPECIFIC AIM 2: To determine the
biological, biochemical, and histological correlates of ChemR23-targeted PET by “active” and “activatable”
tracers in a mouse model of ALI. Our ultimate goal is to develop bioactivatable PET tracers for precision medicine
imaging of ongoing lung injury and inflammation along the ChemR23-chemerin axis to improve research and
clinical prognostic tools."

10868537,"Project Summary
Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 2 million individuals in the United States and are
associated with considerable morbidity. Existing treatments achieve remission in fewer than 50% of patients.
Further, despite achieving endoscopic remission, up to 30% of patients with CD or UC will relapse over the
subsequent three years. Pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to relapse have not been well established. The
central premise of our proposal is that despite endoscopic, there exists a local pro-inflammatory microbial milieu
and transcriptional profile that favors disease relapse. We hypothesize that current clinical tools do not have
sufficient resolution to capture this state. Existing cohorts, by recruiting patients in a heterogeneous state of
active inflammation, cannot be used to infer mechanisms of loss of remission and inception of inflammation. A
targeted effort that comprehensively and longitudinally profiles a homogeneous cohort of patients in deep
remission is essential to define the dynamic relationship between microbial alterations, metabolomic,
transcriptional, and proteomic perturbations, and onset of inflammation. Identifying deficient components
favoring relapse also allows the development of intervention to replace these deficiencies, thereby extending
remission. They will also provide clues and serve as starting points for development of novel therapies. In the
first aim, we will recruit 300 patients with IBD in clinical and endoscopic remission and prospectively,
systematically follow them for 3 years. We will comprehensively characterize such patients through serial
sampling of mucosal and fecal microbiome, serum and fecal metabolome, and proteome in addition to detailed
environmental exposure assessment and measurement of drug pharmacokinetics. We will determine the
dynamic predictive utility of each of these parameters in defining future relapse from a state of quiescence. In
the second aim, we will define the role of pro-inflammatory changes at the cellular level by performing single cell
transcriptomic analysis from colonic and ileal biopsies in patients with quiescent CD and UC recruited as above.
This will provide important insights into loss of control of inflammation at the tissue level that determines future
clinical activity. The final study aim will train and validate a machine-learning predictive model to define the
contribution of each additional biologic layer to inception of inflammation and to identify more robust biomarkers
of a state of sustained remission. Defining the molecular basis of future relapse in patients in deep remission will
provide insights into the ‘pre-disease’ state, allowing for identification of immune pathways of relevance in
preventing disease. Defining the fundamental mechanisms through which disease inception occurs from
quiescence is critically important to inform key steps in the pathogenesis of these complex diseases, which in
turn, will offer opportunities for targeted mechanism-driven interventions to aid durable maintenance of remission
and health. The approaches and analyses outlined also have broad applicability to other autoimmune diseases."
10829417,"Mitochondria play essential roles in cell biology because are central hubs of most metabolic pathways. They are
not only essential for energy conversion, but also for the biosynthesis and catabolism of virtually all cell
constituents. Mitochondrial dysfunction causes havoc in all cells, but especially in those cell types that are highly
dependent on mitochondrial energetic and metabolic functions, such as neurons and glia. Genetic alterations of
the mitochondrial proteome, which includes more than 1000 proteins, encoded by both the nuclear and the
mitochondrial genomes, result in primary mitochondrial disorders. These diseases, for which there is currently
no effective treatment, result in severe and often fatal neurodegeneration. Mitochondrial dysfunction also plays
a role in the pathogenesis of many age-related neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer and Parkinson
disease and ALS. Therefore, addressing therapeutically the consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction could
have a profound impact on the treatment of many human disorders. A major challenge in devising effective
treatments for mitochondrial encephalopathies is our limited understanding of the ramifications of the effects of
mitochondrial dysfunction. The conventional view that these disorders are caused simply by energy failure is
inadequate, as it is becoming increasingly clear that mitochondrial dysfunction affects much more than just ATP
generation and leads to an extensive rewiring of cell metabolism. An exciting new development in the field is the
observation that various types of mitochondrial dysfunction activate transcriptional and metabolic responses that
involve multiple stress signaling pathways. We and others have identified a “mitochondrial integrated stress
response” (mtISR) in diverse genetic forms of mitochondrial disorders, suggesting that mtISR is strongly
associated with mitochondrial diseases and a potential pathogenic common denominator. We postulate that,
while in the short term these responses may be compensatory, if sustained and unresolved, they become
maladaptive and causes imbalances of key metabolites, which may be more detrimental than the energy defect
itself. While we now fully appreciate these maladaptive mechanisms in peripheral tissues, such as muscle and
heart, very little is known about them in the CNS affected by mitochondrial encephalopathies. A deeper
knowledge of the characteristics and the consequences of the mtISR in the CNS is needed to understand its
pathogenic significance and develop targets therapeutic strategies. Our research group has a long-standing
commitment to investigating the pathogenic mechanisms of mitochondrial diseases and we have accumulated
over two decades of expertise in studying the mechanisms of mitochondrial encephalopathies and mitochondrial
dysfunction in neurodegeneration. In this R35 application, we focus on fundamental gaps in knowledge on the
mtISR in mitochondrial encephalopathies by studying disease models that recapitulate human diseases. We will
use a series of approaches, both established and technologically innovative, to generate a blueprint of the
metabolic rewiring in the diseased CNS and identify targets potentially responsive to therapeutic modulation."
10868474,"SUMMARY
The complement system comprises over 30 proteins, mostly plasmatic, forming the oldest branch of the human
immune system. When activated by a pathogen, the complement system amplifies a loop that leads to the
destruction of the invading organism. Plasma and surface inhibitors tightly regulate complement activation to
prevent or limit self-damage. Unfortunately, gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in the complement activator factor
B (FB) found in some rare patients cause permanent complement activation that can lead to autoinflammation.
GOF-FB is more efficient at activating complement and is resistant to natural complement inhibitors. Given the
enhanced activity of these mutants, we hypothesize that we can redirect GOF-FB to target specific malignant
cells or tissues for therapeutic purposes and with minimal side effects. In this application, we propose generating
and testing in vitro molecules to direct GOF complement activating proteins specifically to cancer cells and solid
tumors. In Aim 1, we will fuse GOF-FB to single-chain variable antibody fragments (scFV) to direct complement
activation to specific cells or antigenic targets. This engineered biologic approach to target immunotherapy will
lead to less expensive and off-the-shelf alternatives to chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) and be
immediately relevant for hematologic malignancies. These molecules could also overcome some of the current
issues with antibody therapies, including complement consumption and inhibition by the tumor cells. In Aim 2,
we will couple GOF-FB to proteins that bind components of the solid tumor or its microenvironment. This
approach will promote inflammation in regions in and around solid tumors and enhance local immune responses
that can ultimately eliminate tumors or resolve tissue damage. Due to the nature of GOF-FB, these molecules
will be resistant to tumor microenvironmental immune suppression mechanisms. In aim 3, we will generate
murine GOF-FB that will pave the way to translate our findings to animal models allowing for in vivo proof of
concept experiments, preclinical studies, and assessments of safety and efficacy. Our proposed work is highly
innovative and yet supported by solid literature evidence. We propose to prove in vitro that GOF-FB can have
potential as an anti-cancer therapy. These newly engineered molecules based on human complement immune
disorders could pinpoint a new class of immune modulators with greater specificity, reach, and activity than
current treatments. It represents a different direction from previous research performed in our lab, but the
expertise required to carry out the proposed work and the collaborators are already in place. Furthermore, the
proven efficacy of some FDA-approved complement inhibitors used to treat diseases caused by GOF mutations
in complement activation assures that our approach will have minimal side effects that can be readily addressed.
The work proposed here to leverage GOF mutations to identify new therapies could improve the treatment of a
myriad of severe diseases, including cancer, autoimmunity, and even infectious diseases."

The goal of this Independent Scientist Award (K02) is to seek “protected time” for a period of intensive
research focus to enhance the Candidate’s career development and to conduct research on the comparative
effectiveness of competing brief alcohol interventions and their mechanisms. The proposed research strategy
represents an ongoing, NIAAA-supported independent research program (R01 AA019511: Estimating
Comparative Effectiveness of Alcohol Interventions for Young Adults, received 3rd percentile score). This K02
extends the R01 by (1) including an additional 25 data sets of individual participant data from brief alcohol
interventions conducted between 2013 and 2020, and (2) embracing machine learning algorithms and other
state-of-the-art statistical methods to help identify mechanisms of behavior change and to integrate and
synthesize them across heterogeneous studies. The proposed protected time will be critical to update and
enrich my research program in this current, rapidly changing clinical research environment. With accumulating
high-quality clinical data and real-world data in the context of emerging data science capabilities, there exist
opportunities as well as challenges. I am well suited to tackle emerging challenges for unprecedented
opportunities, given my work in statistical data integration and broad experience in alcohol research. I want to
create a large database where one can simultaneously examine secular/cohort effects, intervention effects,
and effect heterogeneity at the most granular data level by developing and using new tools. My career goal is
to become “one of the major hubs,” connecting disparate networks of researchers into a large connected
network, promoting fluid interactions. The synergy from the large, interdisciplinary network would be helpful
toward creating a “value” proposition of Big Data – the sum of the knowledge and insights from the
collaboration by investigators is greater than isolated pursuits by each. Toward this goal, career development
activities will be to (1) train in computational machine learning algorithms and real-world large-dimensional data
analysis to facilitate collaboration with addiction researchers and statisticians; (2) enhance my understanding
of technology-assisted adaptive interventions and passively collected outcomes data; (3) update my
knowledge in basic health sciences related to addiction; and (4) submit at least two publications and two grants
per year using newly acquired knowledge and skills proposed under K02. I have identified six highly active,
nationally acclaimed experts in their respective fields. I will have individual and group research meetings with
all six collaborators (three new collaborators for this K02) to develop innovative projects. In addition, I will
attend workshops and conferences for training, carry out online training, and have guided reading and

10827941,"Abstract
Adult skin interfollicular epidermis (IFE) renewal is currently described by simple models of
relatively homogenous basal stem/progenitor cells. However, long-term IFE renewal is likely
orchestrated by the physiological demands of a complex tissue architecture comprising multiple
levels of heterogeneity. We began to elucidate the cellular and molecular organization of two
spatially distinct IFE domains, their physiological relevance, and the relationship between mouse
and human skin. We demonstrate that molecular and cellular states of mouse tail basal
microdomains (scales and inter-scales) recapitulate human skin IFE spatial organization in rete
ridges and inter-ridges. We begin to uncover a physiological relevance for the skin spatial
domains: adaptation to differential UV exposure. We identify multiple IFE populations with distinct
behavior in clonal analysis and describe the first in vivo epidermal transit-amplifying (TA) cell. The
later uniquely displays a maturation-dependent behavior with a timed-transition from an
amplification phase to an extinction phase. This opens-up a new road for investigating molecular
mechanisms of timed transitions from a ‘young’ to a ‘mature’ cell state. Using mouse genetics, we
develop new tools to label and characterize IFE domains that are most UV exposed and examine
in depth: (1) IFE spatial heterogeneity and domain organization in skin and its physiological
significance; and (2) the heterogeneity of IFE stem/TA population behavior in skin, how this
relates to regeneration capacity of spatial domains, and what are the mechanisms of cell fate
transition from a young to a mature TA cell state, and from a stem to a TA cell. We propose that
the extraordinary IFE complexity of basal cell states, multiple stem/TA cell populations, and spatial
organization may explain the unusual robustness of skin homeostasis in response to
constant environmental challenges."
10810679,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a rising public health threat characterized by progression from steatosis,
to hepatocyte injury, inflammation, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A key unanswered question is
how inflammation and hepatic fibrosis create a ‘pro-carcinogenic stroma’ that promotes the development of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), even without co-existent cirrhosis. Central to these stromal changes is the
activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which are resident perisinusoidal, vitamin A-rich cells that
transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts (cancer-associated fibroblasts, or CAFs) to secrete a host of extracellular
matrix constituents, growth factors, and cytokines. The objective of this research is to clarify the role of hepatic
stellate cells in the pathogenesis of NASH and HCC. We and our collaborators have developed two highly
efficient, complementary models of HSC depletion that can address critical gaps in understanding their role in
NASH fibrosis and HCC: 1) JEDI (“Just EGFP death inducing”) T-cells, in which CD8+ T cells engineered to kill
cells that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) are administered to transgenic mice, in which GFP is driven
by the b-PDGF receptor promoter, killing 99% of HSCs; 2) CAR T cells targeting urokinase plasminogen
activated receptor (uPAR), which eliminate only senescent HSCs in murine liver. Concurrently, we have created
a highly reproducible murine NASH model that faithfully replicates the histology, fibrosis progression and HCCs
of human NASH. Our central hypothesis is that activated and senescent HSCs in NASH express unique drivers
that contribute to a tumor-prone stromal microenvironment. Thus, this proposal concurrently investigates the
dynamics and unique contributions of HSCs to NASH, and the stromal abnormalities they generate that give rise
to HCC. We will address this hypothesis in three interrelated, but distinct Specific Aims:1) To define the
dynamics, origin and cellular features of HSC repopulation before and after their depletion in normal and NASH
mice; 2) To establish the relative contributions of senescent and non-senescent HSCs to NASH fibrosis and
HCC; 3) To identify HSC-derived stromal drivers of HCC in murine and human NASH. This innovative approach
leveraging unique animal models is significant because it will yield fundamental new insights into HSC biology
in health and disease, define specific stromal drivers that they regulate, and link abnormalities from mouse
models to human NASH-HCC to establish their clinical relevance as potential therapeutic targets."
10802339,"ABSTRACT
Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the gold standard of care in patients with end-stage liver disease and
those with tumors of hepatic origin. However, the scarcity of donor organs prompted the use of extended criteria
“marginal” livers, which are particularly susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), which predispose to
acute/chronic rejection, and may require re-transplantation. We have introduced the concept of organ
“rejuvenation”, i.e., conversion of the donor liver from the state of IRI-hypersensitivity to the homeostatic state of
IRI-resistance. We have also proposed that SIRT1 deacetylase serves as a rheostat linking IR-stress with liver
rejuvenation in both, mouse and human OLT. We have recently identified new regulators of hepatic resistance
against warm vs. cold ischemia stress responses, i.e., Human Antigen R (HuR) and Hypoxia-Inducible Factor
(HIF-1α). We have also discovered Ikaros (IKZF1), acts as a macrophage activation marker and exacerbates
liver IRI. Importantly, we also found that preserved hepatocellular function/improved clinical outcomes in human
OLT patients were associated with increased HuR/HIF-1α but depressed Ikaros levels in the liver biopsy
samples. We hypothesize that crosstalk between hepatocyte HuR / HIF-1α and macrophage Ikaros provides a
new means to regulate the adaptation of donor livers to IR-stress and reperfusion-mediated hepatic damage.
Specific Aim 1: Determine mechanisms of hepatocyte HuR / HIF-1α crosstalk with SIRT1 in IRI-OLT.
Hypothesis: Hepatocyte SIRT1 activation, controlled by distinct hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) requirements for
HuR (warm H/R) vs. HIF-1α (cold H/R), provide new means to regulate adaptation of donor livers to IR-stress.
1.1: SIRT1 function is dependent on HuR signaling for anti-inflammatory responses in oxidative stress. 1.2:
HuR/HIF-1α signaling in a mouse model of hepatic ischemia is temperature stress-dependent. 1.3: HIF-1α
controls cold-induced IRI-OLT. 1.4: HuR controls warm-induced IRI-OLT.
Specific Aim 2: Delineate mechanisms of macrophage Ikaros crosstalk with SIRT1 in IRI-OLT.
Hypothesis: Macrophage Ikaros signaling exacerbates IRI-OLT by repressing SIRT1 transcription and M2
macrophage polarization. 2.1: Ikaros-SIRT1 myeloid axis influences hepatic HuR/HIF1α hypoxia sensing circuit
in IRI-OLT. 2.2: Macrophage Ikaros signaling depends on SIRT1 transcription for M2 polarization.
Specific Aim 3: Define mechanism of human liver rejuvenation under hypothermic machine preservation.
Hypothesis: Manipulation of HIF-1α / SIRT1 axis during ex-vivo HMP improves hepatocellular function to
rejuvenate human livers declined for transplantation due to preexisting poor quality. 3.1: Pharmacological
stabilizer of HIF-1α protein synergizes with SIRT1 to improve human liver function. 3.2: Preconditioning with
PHD-inhibitor, which activates/stabilizes HIF-1α, synergizes with enhanced SIRT1 signaling to ameliorate
inflammation, promote cytoprotection, and rejuvenate human livers. These experiments are of high relevance to
refine donor liver donation (DBD and DCD) as well as to improve quality/size of the current organ supply."
10815833,"Abstract: Multiple sclerosis, a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease associated with demyelination of the
central nervous system (CNS), remains a public health issue. Currently there is no known cure for multiple
sclerosis. Although several disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) are available, relapsing of multiple sclerosis
occurs frequently and DMTs often result in severe adverse effects such as liver failure and fetal outcomes. Novel
therapies are needed to reduce the disease burden for multiple sclerosis patients. Recently, we published that
Hectd3, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is expressed predominantly in T cells of the immune system, which play a critical
role in pathogenicity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of human multiple
sclerosis. Specifically, we found that Hectd3 controls pathogenic Th17 effector response in EAE by regulating
ubiquitination of Malt1 and Stat3 in a non-degradative manner, resulting in stabilization of Malt1 and Stat3. In
addition, Hectd3-mediated polyubiquitination of Stat3 promotes Stat3 activation. Moreover, Hectd3-deficient
mice showed reduction in EAE disease scores, Th17 cell pathogenicity and effector Th17 cytokines.
Furthermore, Hectd3 deficiency causes a cell-intrinsic defect in Th17 cell pathogenicity that is responsible for
the attenuation of EAE in Hectd3−/− mice. Overall, our results demonstrate that Hectd3 is a critical modulator of
Malt1 and Stat3 signaling in EAE. Based on these results, we hypothesize that compounds abolishing Hectd3-
mediated ubiquitination of substrates can lower EAE severity. However, although Hectd3 plays significant roles
in pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, currently there is no chemical probe to further investigate the pathways
and the implication in therapy of multiple sclerosis. Therefore, in this proposal, we aim to develop high throughput
screening assays to identify and characterize chemical probes to investigate in depth the biochemistry of Hectd3-
mediated Malt1 and Stat3 signaling pathways, and their therapeutic potential in pathogenic Th17 cells and EAE.
This innovative work explores the novel function of Hectd3 in immune regulation, specifically in pathogenic
Th17 cells, the identification of Malt1 and Stat3 as target substrates for Hectd3-mediated ubiquitination, and
characterization of novel chemical probes for Hectd3, and their impact on EAE. The long-term sustained
impact of this work is to identify compounds to modulate Hectd3 activity on its target substrates and its functions
in EAE to open avenues for development of more specific and effective immune therapies to treat multiple
sclerosis, a crucial need given current treatment challenges and limited therapeutic options. These combined
approaches will lead to the development of unique Hectd3 inhibitors with novel inhibition mechanisms. This work
will have a global reach by promoting fresh and effective strategies to treat multiple sclerosis. Hectd3 has also
been implicated in promoting breast cancer drug resistance, cancer metastasis (unpublished results), and
bacterial infections. Therefore, this project may also have significant impact on cancers and bacterial defense."

Natural killer (NK) cells provide an immediate defense against viruses and tumors by virtue of their ability to
respond to infected or malignant cells without prior antigenic stimulation. This is accomplished through the
integration of signals from activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors (aNKRs & iNKRs). In humans and other
primate species, these include C-type lectin receptors, such as CD94/NKG2A and CD94/NKG2C, and the
highly polymorphic killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), both of which interact with MHC class I
ligands. These receptor-ligand interactions are fundamental to the ability of NK cells to differentiate healthy
cells from unhealthy cells and provide a potential mechanism of specificity for the development of “NK cell
memory”. NK cells can have a significant impact on HIV-1 infection. KIR and HLA class I polymorphisms have
been identified that are associated with lower viral loads and slower courses of disease progression and
certain NK cell subsets can kill HIV-infected cells in culture. Thus, NK cell-based therapies represent a
promising approach for targeting HIV-infected cells and reducing the size of viral reservoirs. We hypothesize
that viral peptides bound by the MHC class I ligands of aNKRs are critical to NK cell recognition and killing of
HIV/SIV-infected cells and that the adoptive transfer of ex vivo activated NK cells in combination with latency
reversal can deplete viral reservoirs in SIV-infected macaques on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART).
In Aim 1, we will determine the contribution of viral peptides bound by MHC class I ligands of aNKRs to NK
cell recognition of HIV- and SIV-infected cells. These studies will utilize high-throughput cellular assays to
rapidly screen viral peptides for MHC class I interactions with aNKRs and to identify substitutions that disrupt
these interactions. The corresponding changes will be introduced into HIV-1 and SIV to assess their impact on
NK cell responses to virus-infected cells. In Aim 2, we will assess the capacity of ex vivo expanded NK cells in
combination with latency reversal to deplete viral reservoirs in SIV-infected, ART-suppressed rhesus
macaques. This aim will take advantage of barcoded SIV and a potent new latency reversal agent to compare
with maximal sensitivity the ability of autologous versus allogeneic NK cell transfer to reduce the rate of viral
reactivation after discontinuing ART. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that the depletion of viral reservoirs
by adaptive NK cell transfer can be enhanced by an Env-specific antibody with antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity against SIV-infected cells. This aim will use a similar approach as Aim 2 to determine the extent to
which coupling NK cell effector function to the unparalleled specificity of antibodies can maximize reservoir
depletion. These unprecedented studies will provide a better understanding of the role of viral peptides in NK
cell recognition of HIV- and SIV-infected cells and an important proof-of-concept for the development of NK cell
therapies to eradicate HIV-1 reservoirs in chronically infected individuals."
10816564,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A major barrier in the field of opioid research is our limited understanding of the organization of the opioid system
in the brain: we still do not know which cell types express each opioid receptor (mu, delta, kappa, nociceptin) to
mediate the effects of endogenous and exogenous opioids, nor what other molecules are present in these cells.
Without this knowledge, understanding how opioids alter activity in circuits to produce behavioral effects remains
elusive. This gap in knowledge prevents the identification of molecular targets to potentiate opioid analgesia and
mitigate the deleterious effects of opioid use disorder (OUD), including addiction and respiratory depression.
 To fill this gap in knowledge, we propose to leverage the uniquely massive single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) database generated by the Allen Institute for Brain Science (>3.4 million cells throughout the entire
mouse brain) as part of the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) effort. Using this database, we will
establish a comprehensive catalog of all the cell types that express each opioid receptor and peptide throughout
the brain, as well as the co-expression of gene networks that mediate or regulate opioid actions, including other
G protein-coupled receptors and cellular effectors of opioid receptors (Aim 1). Further, we will use our well-
established high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq pipelines to characterize the cell-type-specific molecular
adaptations that occur during chronic opioid exposure, withdrawal, and abstinence, using a clinically relevant
model of post-surgical pain for which opioids are typically prescribed (Aim 2). Finally, we will leverage this novel
knowledge to dissect the mechanisms of action of opioids by performing advanced circuit mapping and in vivo
functional imaging studies of cell types expressing opioid receptors in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a region critical
to both opioid analgesia and addiction (Aim 3).
 Our transformative work will be the first to combine several highly innovative technologies at the
molecular, circuit, and neural ensemble levels, including high-throughput scRNA-seq, new viral strains with
improved transsynaptic transfer and decreased toxicity for circuit mapping, the crystal skull and miniscope-
microprism optical approaches for in vivo wide-field imaging of brain state and for recording dynamics of
molecularly defined neuron types in freely moving mice undergoing opioid analgesia and addiction paradigms.
 We have an extraordinary interdisciplinary team of investigators with highly complementary expertise in
the neurobiology of opioids and the distribution and function of their receptors in pain and addiction circuits, the
molecular and anatomical brain architecture, large-scale cell type characterization and circuit mapping, and
highly innovative brain imaging methods as applied to the study of neural circuits.
 Overall, this research aims to generate an exceptional resource for the opioid field (to be made publicly
available through the NIDA-funded SCORCH data coordination center) to explain how opioids change the brain,
and discover novel therapeutic approaches to prevent and treat OUD."

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) Program in Translational Medicine (PiTM) was first
established in 2006 with funding support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and later supported by a
T32 from the National Institutes of Health. The UNC PiTM is a unique program that fills unmet needs among
biomedical graduate students at UNC. Unlike department- and disease-focused programs, the PiTM is cross-
department, -diseases, and -disciplines, providing our trainees with a rich exposure to diverse topics in
translational medicine. The primary objective of the PiTM is to train a cadre of PhD researchers with the
knowledge and skills necessary to recognize, appreciate, and address clinically-relevant biological problems
related to human disease from the perspective of basic science. To accomplish this goal, the PiTM trains basic
science PhD students to work in multidisciplinary teams composed of scientists, physician-scientists, and
clinicians, using state-of-the-art experimental approaches and patient-derived resources. The trainees have a
dual (scientist/clinical) mentored experience, a rigorous clinical exposure, and blended core coursework that
enhances training in translational medicine. Trainees also receive additional training to build communication and
leadership skills essential for future team science and community outreach endeavors. The PiTM structure
includes both funded and unfunded trainees (~10-15 matriculants each year), each with access to the same
rigorous training opportunities and experiences throughout their graduate tenure. This structure enables us to
maximize diversity within the PiTM and enhance the training experience. With this current application, we request
support for 6 1-year slots for outstanding PiTM trainees. The PiTM has over a decade of experience in best
practices training over 150 basic science PhD students, 67% female and 19% underrepresented, to perform
translational research. The proposed training leverages this experience to create a unique training model for
preparing the next generation of PhD researchers to effectively lead and contribute to multidisciplinary teams of
translational researchers."

The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Promoting Equity, Diversity, and Academic Success through Aging
Research (UWM STAR) program is a training program aimed at increasing the participation of BIPOC (Black,
Indigenous, People of Color) students in research focused on reducing health disparities in older adults. UWM
is the ideal location for this program because it has the most diverse student body in the University of Wisconsin
System and is situated in the state’s most racially and ethnically diverse city. As the population ages, the need
for workers in health-related fields who are sensitive to the needs of underrepresented and disadvantaged
communities will also grow. UWM’s STAR program seeks to help fill that gap by preparing students from
underrepresented backgrounds for graduate training and careers in aging and public health.
The UWM STAR program is a multi-year, cohort-based program that matches students from underrepresented
backgrounds with mentors to conduct research in aging and health disparities. It is based on successful programs
developed by UWM’s Office of Undergraduate Research over the last 20 years. The STAR program provides
financial support to conduct research on aging and health disparities during the academic year and in the
summer. These mentored multi-year research experiences serve as the cornerstone of the program, and
research mentors have been selected for the program based on both the excellence of their research program
and their dedication to training undergraduates. The experience gained in the lab will be reinforced through
seminars and curricular opportunities, including a dedicated First-Year STAR Seminar to introduce students to
research, STAR Aging Colloquia to expose students to the work of distinguished aging researchers, STAR
Launch trips to potential graduate training campuses, and the STAR Senior Seminar to help students plan their
post-graduation lives. To keep students on a timely track for graduation, the STAR program will provide
supplemental academic advising. The STAR program is also designed to provide students with the social support
and peer mentoring they need to succeed. Regular social gatherings provide space for students in the program
to bond with one another and with program mentors and administrators. The relationships within the program
form a support network to help students overcome challenges and to champion each other’s successes,
increasing persistence in the program.
By combining structured research experiences, tailored learning opportunities, and social engagement, UWM’s
STAR program aims to increase participation, retention, and graduation of underrepresented college students at
UWM. Achieving these aims would be a first step toward the long-term goal of diversifying the pool of researchers
and public health workers who contribute to reducing health disparities for older adults."

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a complex and pervasive public health problem disproportionately affecting
American Indian (AI) and Black women, who ordinarily do not seek help, but who experience the worst health
outcomes including homicide. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, help-seeking for AI and Black women has
become even more complicated amidst a global concern among advocates that social distancing, quarantine,
and isolation measures are inadvertently endangering women experiencing IPV. To our knowledge, while
anecdotal evidence shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has complicated women’s experiences of violence with
a possible rise in levels of violence resulting in lethal outcomes, no systematic studies exist that track women’s
experiences of IPV during this pandemic. To address this urgent gap, we propose a community-based
participatory research (CBPR) study informed by Indigenous and Black feminist thought, that will employ
qualitative and quantitative methods, enabling us to systematically describe the unique and intersecting
structural, economic, and interpersonal facilitators and barriers to help-seeking for IPV among AI and Black
women in urban and rural areas of Wisconsin during theCOVID-19 pandemic. We will conduct surveys and
individual and focus group interviews with 300 AI and Black women every year for three years to track women’s
experiences, patterns of help-seeking, and barriers to help-seeking. Women will be recruited from community-
based partner agencies across the state as well as at other sites where our partners ordinarily inform women
about their services, in order to capture women seeking help as well as women who have not sought help. Our
ultimate goal through this study is to create a platform where women’s voices can then inform health practice
and health policy while also drawing from a community advisory board constituted of advocates and other key
members of AI and Black communities in Wisconsin, to provide actionable recommendations for addressing the
urgent problem of IPV in the lives of AI and Black women. Our proposed CBPR study is in line with the mission
and goals of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities because it focuses on two
populations that are disproportionately affected by the pandemic, while also ordinarily disproportionately
impacted by IPV. Additionally, this CBPR study engages grassroots, community-based agencies with an
academic partner (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee) in scholarship that is grounded in women’s realities, is
participatory in nature, and is built upon the capacities and the resilience of community members."

Zebrafish is a premiere organism to study vertebrate development, physiology, behavior, genetics, and
disease. Powerful techniques allow efficient generation and recovery of zebrafish mutations affecting genes
that regulate developmental patterning, organogenesis, physiology, and behavior. Recent advances make it
easy to study gene function in transgenic zebrafish and with antisense oligonucleotides. The functions of
many, if not most of these genes are conserved among vertebrate groups. Thus, analysis of zebrafish
mutations provides insights into gene function in other vertebrates, including humans.
The Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC) has been established as a repository that provides
animals, materials, and services to the research community. This proposal seeks continued funding 1) to serve
as a central repository for zebrafish genetic stocks and research materials, 2) to provide consultation and
pathology services, and 3) to develop feeding and nutrition strategies for zebrafish that support ZIRC and
research community husbandry goals. ZIRC materials, services, and husbandry and health standards will be
made widely available to the research community."

10874420,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Greater disease severity and a more rapid disease progression is observed among US minority populations
such as African Americans (AA) and Hispanics (Latinx) with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) compared to whites with
MS. Despite these observations, very little data is available regarding the biological underpinnings resulting in
this increased risk of unequivocal advancing disease among minorities with MS even though the incidence of
MS disease is growing among minority populations. Further, there are concerns that AA and Latinx with MS
are refractory to first-line therapies, which increases the concern that the poor outcomes reported reflect
substandard care and treatment.
Our long term goal is to facilitate prevention of neurological deficits in minority patients with MS by identifying
the mechanism(s) of CNS inflammation contributing to intensified progression and severity of disease. Others
have shown that minorities with MS display higher IgG index and synthesis rate, oligoclonal band positivity and
an inverse correlation of IgG index with gray matter atrophy. These data support a pronounced role for B cells
and their antibody products in the pathobiology of MS in minority populations.
Our central hypothesis is that the underlying mechanism of unequivocal advancing disease among minorities
with MS involves expansion of plasmablasts producing antibodies and/or inflammatory products that cause
neuronal toxicity independent of genetic (i.e. ancestral) predispositions. These studies will provide novel
mechanistic insights into the role of neuron-reactive plasmablasts in CNS inflammatory events associated with
intensified progression and severity of disease in minorities with MS. Our findings will also support future
studies to develop diagnostic and predictive tools that inform patient response to treatment and inform clinical
course such as relapse of MS or progression to MS in minority populations."

St. Mary’s University is a Hispanic-serving institution in San Antonio, TX, with a long history of
successfully preparing underrepresented minority students to enter professional schools. For nearly 40
years, St. Mary’s has been committed to training the next generation of biomedical scientists through the
MARC U*STAR Program. To continue and extend our 40-year efforts to train the next generation of
biomedical scientists, the URISE program at St. Mary’s will build the pool of students interested in
research by involving and exposing high school students to STEM research, providing interested St.
Mary’s students opportunities to participate in biomedical research with faculty specifically trained to
mentor undergraduates underrepresented in STEM, and providing individualized development training to
a cohort of students intent on pursuing a Ph.D. in biomedical sciences. Specifically, our URISE program
will provide 16 (8 junior and 8 senior) students a two-year training program designed to give them the
technical, operational, and professional skills necessary to transition into research-focused higher degree
programs and the biomedical workforce. We propose the following specific aims: 1) To build the interest of
underrepresented students in research careers in the biomedical sciences and pursuing a Ph.D. degree in
biomedical sciences through early outreach and interactions with local high schools; 2)To implement a
research track curriculum designed to mentor, train, and engage underrepresented students in biomedical
research (including community college transfer students) and increase the number of students interested
in research careers. 3) To recruit and prepare a diverse pool of URISE scholars who complete their
baccalaureate degree, and transition into and complete biomedical, research-focused higher degree
programs (e.g., Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D.) and pursue biomedical research careers. The URISE program is
expected to advance the research culture at St. Mary’s, increase the number of students interested in
pursuing research careers and Ph.D.s in the biomedical sciences, and produce responsible biomedical
scientists. Equally important, is that the broad exposure to biomedical science research will be beneficial
to students who are not seeking higher degrees in STEM but, as a result, stay in STEM and join the
biomedical workforce."
10851704,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Established biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as amyloid beta measured with PET, are expensive
and invasive. Cost-efficient, quick, and easy-to-administer motor measures, such as grip strength and walking
speed, have shown to precede the cognitive symptoms of AD by several years. Relative to single measures,
combining ambulatory and strength measures boosts predictive value for AD. This suggests that a composite
motor profile score that weighs functions spanning the breadth of motor domains will have optimal predictive
power. Cognitive and motor brain regions that are known to degenerate early (e.g., the hippocampus and
fornix) and later in the AD disease process (e.g., the cerebellum, (pre)motor cortex, and corticospinal tract) are
candidates for the prediction of motor dysfunction in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. The objective of
this K01 proposal is two-fold: 1) to further develop the research skills of the applicant with a series of mentored
activities, and 2) to identify the behavioral and neural motor profiles of MCI and AD with the aim of developing
a robust and valid risk scoring algorithm. Our central hypothesis is that a motor behavioral composite score
and neural motor profile score distinguish individuals with MCI and AD from healthy control subjects, and are
related to established AD biomarkers (amyloid burden, hippocampal volume, and APOE e4 status). The project
has three specific aims: 1) Quantify behavioral and neural motor dysfunction in MCI and AD; 2) Identify
behavioral and neural motor composite scores as novel AD biomarkers; and 3) Replicate a motor composite
score as AD biomarker in a large independent sample from the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging.
 The training plan aims to establish expertise in areas that are crucial for the candidate to conduct the
proposed research and to become an independent investigator in the field of AD. The following training goals
have been identified in close collaboration with the mentoring team: a) establishing a clinical perspective and
the conceptual framework required to implement effective research in MCI and AD; b) develop expertise in
machine learning relevant to prediction modeling; c) gaining an in-depth understanding of neurological motor
signs and function in MCI and AD; and d) develop expertise on AD biomarkers and their perceived role in AD
etiology. The training will be closely supervised by clinical experts of AD (Dr. Duff), and leaders in the field of
neural motor dysfunction in aging (Dr. Rosano), AD biomarkers (Dr. Foster), MCI risk factors (Dr. Kremen), and
machine learning (Dr. Tasdizen). The candidate's optimal institutional environment further ensures the success
of the training and research plan that will provide data for an R01 application on the prediction of MCI to AD
transition from a motor profile composite score. The proposed research makes a significant contribution
towards the development of novel cost-efficient AD biomarkers that can serve to enrich clinical trials and for
diagnostic purposes, consistent with the mission of the NIA."

10814890,"PROJECT SUMMARY CANCER EDUCATION & CAREER ENHANCEMENT 
The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) has established a unique Cancer Education & Career Enhancement (CECE) 
Core within The Jackson Laboratory Cancer Center (JAXCC). JAX has deep experience in educating future and 
early career scientists in genetics and genomics, effectively leveraging modular and scalable educational 
units. The CECE Core focuses this experience on developing a diverse pipeline of early career cancer 
researchers to maximize their potential for impact on challenges in cancer. Aligned with the institutional 
commitment to educating the external research community, the Core offers educational programs in cancer 
genomics and genetics for internal and external scientists at many career stages and from varied backgrounds. 
The CECE leverages the well-regarded education programs managed by JAX's Education team, including the 
historic Summer Student Program, the renowned cancer-related short courses and workshops, and The Whole 
Scientist career development program. Dr. Linda Hicke, JAX Vice President for Education, leads the CECE Core 
as its first JAXCC Associate Director for Cancer Education and Career Enhancement. The CECE team has deep 
expertise in curriculum development, course design, postgraduate training, clinical and continuing medical 
education, and online education. The CECE Core also leverages JAX cancer genomics and informatics 
resources, including the CLIA-certified Clinical Genomics Laboratory and the Clinical Knowledgebase 
informatics to build modular training resources in the translational space for basic research and clinical 
audiences. These have been effectively used in the JAXCC-led Maine Cancer Genomics Initiative (MCGI), which 
provides education on somatic cancer testing to the oncology community in Maine. The CECE partners with 
MCGI to offer new training opportunities for cancer-focused Early Career Researchers in the application and 
implications of clinical cancer genomic testing, and new continuing education opportunities for clinicians. 
The CECE Core serves learners from high school students to faculty and clinicians. Bringing existing programs 
that serve basic research, clinical, and educator audiences under the JAXCC umbrella allows the CECE Core to 
create coordinated, cancer-specific content that informs a broad spectrum of audiences at different stages in the 
scientific workforce pipeline, and recruits early stage trainees to cancer research laboratories. This is 
accomplished through three Specific Aims. Aim 1 supports and encourages JAXCC researchers through 
mentorship and a continuum of cancer courses, workshops and online training tools that provide modular 
educational experiences to foster continuous, life-long learning. Aim 2 provides education and career 
development opportunities to external early career cancer researchers. Aim 3 enhances interactions between 
basic research trainees, faculty and Maine community clinicians, with the goals to inform all participants about 
principles and use of genomic information in clinical decision making."
10898569,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CENTRAL LABORATORY CORE
The overarching goal of the Central Laboratory (CL) Core for the Partnership to Assess Viral and Immune
Landscape Intersections with Oncology for People Living with HIV (PAVILION) is to provide centralized
biobanking and virologic and immunologic assessment of well annotated biospecimens in support of the
proposed translational studies as well as future PAVILION pilot projects. The CL Core will be co-led by three
exceptional investigators, Drs. Johann Schneider (South Africa), Zvavahera (Mike) Chirenje (Zimbabwe), and
Tim Waterboer (Germany), who have complementary expertise. The CL Co-Leaders have designed a robust yet
flexible pipeline and range of analytical methodologies that builds upon the infrastructure and long-term
international collaborations established by the PAVILION partnering investigators in South Africa, Zimbabwe,
the US, and Germany. The CL Core purposefully pairs this unique expertise with established laboratories in the
low- and middle-income country (LMIC) partner countries to efficiently advance knowledge related to tumor and
patient characteristics. This knowledge can then inform the development of effective prevention and cancer
treatment interventions to reduce the burden of cancer for people living with HIV (PLWH) in LMICs
disproportionately impacted by HIV. To achieve the overarching goal, the CL Core will provide centralized,
research-quality pathology evaluation for endpoint adjudication of collected tissues, DNA and RNA extraction,
HPV and EBV detection and genotyping, RNA expression analysis, multiplex viral serology assessment, and
immunological evaluation of the tumor microenvironment for the proposed and future projects. These activities
are organized into the following Aims:
Aim 1: Serve as a centralized biobanking resource in South Africa and Zimbabwe for the collection,
processing, and storage of biospecimens in support of PAVILION studies This aim provides biobanking
of high-burden and under-researched viral cancers in LMIC settings, including non-cervical HPV-associated
cancers (anal, oropharyngeal, penile, and vulvar) and conjunctival cancer, with a suspected but as of yet
unidentified viral etiology amongst PLWH.
Aim 2: Provide centralized virologic and immunologic testing of biospecimens in support of proposed
and future PAVILION studies This aim provides centralized viral and immunologic testing of banked specimens
in support of proposed and future study aims through a robust set of analytical methodologies across four
PAVILION partnering institutions, including LMIC and non-LMIC sites.
Aim 3: Provide centralized expert pathology in support of proposed and future PAVILION studies This
aim provides comprehensive and expert centralized pathology adjudication of banked tissue specimens in
support of the proposed translational studies and future Developmental Core pilot studies."
10898574,"PROJECT SUMMARY – DEVELOPMENTAL CORE
The overarching goal of the Developmental Core (DC) for the Partnership to Assess Viral and Immune
Landscape Intersections with Oncology for People Living with HIV (PAVILION) is to enhance capacity for HIV-
associated cancer research through fostering the career development of junior investigators in South Africa,
Zimbabwe, and the United States who have a demonstrated interest in infection-related cancer research among
people living with HIV (PLWH). This goal involves two broad strategies: 1) implementing a program that
generates and supports rigorous pilot research projects and 2) providing other training and educational resources
to enhance skills necessary for long term career success. This strategy represents a shift in the culture of
research at PAVILION partnering low- and middle-income country (LMIC) institutions. The momentum created
by this strategy would provide significant incentive for junior investigators at these sites to take advantage of pilot
research funding opportunities while consolidating efforts to pursue career development within a supportive
environment with highly experienced mentors, ensuring their long-term success as independent researchers.
Moreover, this pipeline of highly trained researchers with interest in infection-related cancers among PLWH will
meet the critical need for transdisciplinary, multi-institutional, and international partnerships to understand and
potentially mitigate the rapidly growing cancer burden in Africa, where the prevalence of HIV infection remains
high. The PAVILION DC program will help ameliorate this growing public health crisis by supporting junior
investigators who can lead and maximize the rigor of future research focused on cancers occurring among
PLWH1-4 and ensure sustainability of research capacity, strength, and commitment.
The Specific Aims to achieve this goal are:
Aim 1: Competitively award innovative infection-related cancer pilot research projects across the cancer
continuum among PLWH (Area 1) This aim provides funding for junior investigators and mentoring by
experienced senior scientists and clinicians.
Aim 2: Implement educational and career development activities that enhance the capacity to conduct
rigorous infection-related cancer research focused on PLWH (Area 2) This aim provides education,
workshops, courses, and career development activities for PAVILION junior investigators."
10833488,"ABSTRACT
 Human mobility plays a substantial role in driving the acquisition and transmission of HIV and
contributing to poor HIV care cascade outcomes. New evidence from large clinical trials shows that mobility
presents a major challenge to the successful implementation of well-recognized HIV eradication strategies
such as universal testing and treatment, as it can link geographically-spread epidemics, lead to introductions of
HIV into communities, reduce exposure to interventions, and disrupt HIV care engagement. There is an urgent
need to better understand the geospatial and temporal dimensions of mobility that lead to disparities in HIV
outcomes, and for feasible and scalable interventions to improve HIV outcomes in mobile populations. Yet,
research in these areas is nascent. There is a great need for an expanded scientific workforce with training in
human mobility and HIV to tackle these challenges, particularly for scientists under-represented in medicine.
 Dr. Carol Camlin an Associate Professor in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive
Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, and a behavioral scientist with training in social
demography. Her cross-disciplinary research program has focused on the study of human mobility and HIV
prevention and care outcomes. In this application for the Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented
Research (K24), Dr. Camlin proposes a comprehensive mentoring, research and career development plan
which will advance the goal to reduce global disparities in HIV outcomes that result from human mobility.
 The overall goals of this proposal are to: 1) Expand the scope of Dr. Camlin's POR in human mobility
and HIV through pursuit of training in geospatial and social network modeling methods, 2) Lay the groundwork
for conducting high-quality, large-scale, theory driven interventions to improve HIV care cascade outcomes
among mobile PLHIV in SSA; and 2) Engage fellows and junior faculty in the development of new
multidisciplinary POR to advance HIV prevention and treatment goals among mobile populations in Africa.
 While the K24 provides limited resources for new research, with the support and protected time
provided by the K24, Dr. Camlin will be able to leverage the existing infrastructure of her current studies to: 1)
identify the geospatial networks of mobile populations and HIV “risk flows” in areas of Kenya and Uganda (Aim
1); 2) quantify the `distance decay' between clinics in origins and destinations of highly mobile persons living
with HIV (PLHIV) in the settings, and assess its influence on HIV care engagement (Aim 2); synthesize
cumulative findings and new developments in the field using an implementation science framework, and
convene a multidisciplinary panel of experts to review and prioritize promising interventions; and develop and
evaluate the potential feasibility, acceptability and appropriateness of two prototype strategies to improve HIV
care engagement among mobile PLHIV (Aim 3.) With K24 support, this project lays the groundwork for
sustained high impact research to address the challenges posed by mobility to efforts to eradicate HIV."
10898601,"PROJECT 3: SUMMARY
Immunotherapy has significantly improved the clinical outcome of many cancer patients. However, most glioblastoma
(GBM) patients have not, so far, benefited from immunotherapeutic intervention. To explore alternative ways to
potentiate the anti-GBM immunity, we've developed a B-cell-based vaccine (BVax) that consists of 4-1BBL+ B cells
activated with CD40 agonism, BAFF, and IFNg stimulation. In our preclinical study, BVax migrates to critical secondary
lymphoid organs and is proficient at antigen cross-presentation, promoting the survival and functionality of tumor-
infiltrating CD8+ T cells. In addition, BVax produces immunoglobulins (humoral immune response) reactive to the tumor.
These immunoglobulins elicited a potent therapeutic effect. A combination of radiation, BVax, CD8 T cells and PD-L1
blockade conferred tumor eradication in 80% of treated tumor-bearing animals. This research proposal aims to translate
BVax to the clinic to treat newly diagnosed malignant gliomas. To effectively implement this therapy in the clinic, we
propose to perform IND-enabling studies to manufacture autologous BVax and CD8 T cells (Aim 1). Upon FDA approval,
we aim to conduct a first-in-human BVax trial (Aim 2) and evaluate the effect on the immune response (Aim 3). We
hypothesize that the proposed autologous cellular therapy is safe and effective at eliciting protective anti-GBM immunity
via cellular and humoral immune responses. Overall, our study provides a novel alternative to current
immunotherapeutic approaches."
10898610,"PROJECT 4: PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM), a grade IV tumor, is one of the most aggressive and infiltrative brain cancer forms. Patients
currently diagnosed with Glioblastoma (GBM) have an abysmal prognosis. The median survival is around 8-10
months, even after the standard care protocol of surgical resection followed by alkylating chemotherapy (typically
temozolomide or TMZ) and radiotherapy. This is because, in nearly all patients, the tumor recurs after treatment
since GBM cells can become resistant to therapy. Our laboratory's goal is to develop a treatment for GBM that
will reduce the recurrence rate and improve the prognosis for patients. One of the distinguishing characteristics
of cancer is its uncontrolled cell division. Since cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells, they require
more purines, the building blocks of DNA and RNA. Purines are either synthesized from amino acids and other
small molecules through the de novo biosynthesis pathway or are recycled from the microenvironment through
the salvage pathway. Cancer cells use the de novo biosynthesis pathway, whereas the central nervous system
usually relies more on the salvage pathway. We have identified ARL13B as a novel regulator of the purine
biosynthesis pathway during chemotherapy through initial analysis. ARL13B, a member of the ADP-ribosylation
factor-like family protein accountable for cilia maintenance, directly interacts with inosine monophosphate
dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2), the rate-limiting enzyme purine biosynthesis. Our initial studies knocking down
ARL13B inhibited GBM cells' utilization of the de novo pathway after TMZ treatment and increased utilization of
the salvage biosynthesis pathway. The effectiveness of TMZ treatment was also elevated in vitro and in vivo
following ARL13B knockdown. We, therefore, proposed that the ARL13B-IMPDH2 regulated switch from the
salvage pathway to the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway is necessary for GBM cells' adaptation to alkylating-
based chemotherapy. Based on this, we hypothesize that therapeutic transformation in GBM involves interaction
between ciliary protein ARL13B and rate-limiting purine biosynthesis enzyme IMPDH2 Mycophenolate mofetil
(MMF), an FDA-approved drug in the organ-transplant setting, inhibits IMPDH2 activity and allows for increased
the therapeutic efficacy of TMZ and extended the survival of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models across
multiple GBM subtypes. This provides a clinically translatable opportunity to overcome chemoresistance in GBM.
In this proposal, we set to conduct a Phase 1/1b clinical trial of MMF combined with standard chemo- and
radiotherapy for newly diagnosed GBM. The primary objectives are to evaluate this novel combination's safety
and toxicity and establish the maximally tolerated dose (MTD). Exploratory secondary endpoints include
progression-free and overall survival. Furthermore, we intend to investigate mycophenolic acid, an immediate
metabolite of MMF that can serve as a biomarker for such therapy."

Iron overload is a strong risk factor both the incidence of diabetes and the progression of diabetic complications. Reduction of iron content improves diabetic complications and insulin sensitivity. Therefore, a better understanding of iron metabolism in diabetes as well as the precise mechanisms underlying the detrimental role of iron could identify novel treatment modalities for diabetic control. Our published work and new preliminary data have shown that hyperactive protein kinase Cα (PKCα) signaling associated with diabetes promotes dietary iron absorption by up-regulating iron importer divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and exporter ferroportin (Fpn). The importance of PKCα in the regulation of intestinal iron absorption is supported by in vivo findings in PKCα-/- mice showing decreased Fpn expression and increased iron retention in intestinal epithelium as well as diminished liver and serum iron. Liver is the primary site of iron deposition, and plays a major role in systemic glucose homeostasis. We further observed that iron loading exacerbates diabetes-associated liver injury and inflammation through induction of hepatocyte ferroptosis. We hypothesize that PKCα is an important regulator of the crosstalk between diabetes and iron metabolism by mediating hyperglycemia-induced iron loading and exacerbated liver injury. We will utilize multiple genetically engineered mouse models, cultured intestinal epithelial cells, and intestinal biopsies of diabetic patients to address the following interconnected specific aims. Aim 1: To understand the mechanisms by which hyperglycemia-PKCα axis increases intestinal iron import. We will demonstrate that cereblon, a substrate receptor of E3 ubiquitin ligase, binds and mediates the ubiquitination of intestinal DMT1. Hyperactive PKCα inhibits DMT1-cereblon interaction and the ubiquitination/internalization of DMT1, enhancing membrane expression of DMT1 and iron uptake. Aim 2: To understand the mechanism by which hyperactive PKCα up-regulates Fpn stability and iron export in the intestine. We will identify a novel mechanism underlying the regulation of Fpn stability, wherein diabetes-induced activation of PKCα increases Fpn phosphorylation and acetylation counteracting hepcidin-induced ubiquitination and degradation of Fpn. Diabetic up-regulation of Fpn and its PKCα dependency will be also examined using duodenal biopsies of diabetic patients. Aim 3: To identify the mechanism by which iron loading exacerbates diabetic liver injury. We will establish that iron loading, in the context of diabetes-induced impairment in autophagy, induces hepatocytes ferroptosis as a novel mechanism exacerbating liver injury in diabetes. We will further test if the loss-of-function of PKCα alleviates liver injury through reduction of hepatic iron content. These studies will highlight the important role of PKCα in diabetes-induced iron loading and tissue injury as well as the precise molecular mechanisms, laying the foundation for the development of novel treatment modalities in diabetic control."

Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is characterized by myocardial necrosis due to coronary ischemia and may be
precipitated by several mechanisms. Coronary plaque rupture causes ‘type 1 MI,’ the subject of intense
investigation for several decades and now with several therapies demonstrated to reduce mortality and
improve health status. However, it is now recognized that at least 1 in 5 MIs are ‘type 2 MI,’ which occurs due
to a mismatch in myocardial oxygen supply/demand precipitated by a preceding physiologic stress. Persons
with type 2 MI are usually older and have more comorbidities than persons with type 1 MI. However, it is
unknown whether these characteristic differences translate to differences in health status. Type 2 MI is
associated with a poor prognosis; only 40% of individuals are alive at 5 years. Unfortunately, despite the
frequency and prognosis of type 2 MI, evidence-based treatment strategies are lacking due to an absence of
clinical trials. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is demonstrably efficacious for type 1 MI. However,
CR is virtually unused for type 2 MI. Increasing adoption of CR, a covered therapy, may improve outcomes for
persons with type 2 MI. The aims of this research proposal are to (1) determine if differences exist in patient-
reported health status between persons with type 2 versus type 1 MI, (2) obtain key information from patients
and clinicians on the perceived benefits, acceptability, evidence requirement, and barriers to attendance at CR
for type 2 MI compared to type 1 MI, and (3) undertake a pilot hybrid effectiveness-implementation clinical trial
to assess if a multifaceted intervention increases attendance at CR and is potentially efficacious in improving
health status for persons with type 2 MI as compared to usual care. For this latter aim, physicians will receive a
reminder to consider referral to CR and patients will receive access to a patient engagement platform, with CR
appointment reminders. Successful completion of the proposed studies will inform whether health status differs
according to the subtype of MI and will explore if a multilevel intervention can increase CR attendance and
potentially improve health status for those with type 2 MI. The objectives of this research award are to (1)
develop an expertise in health status assessment and patient reported outcome measures, (2) learn how to
design and interpret patient and clinician surveys, and 3) develop an expertise in clinical trial design, execution,
and interpretation. Dr. McCarthy’s career goals are to undertake clinical trials that identify treatment
approaches for individuals with type 2 MI. The findings from this proposal will form the foundation of Dr.
McCarthy’s R01 application for a definitive effectiveness-implementation trial of CR for type 2 MI. Dr.
McCarthy’s mentors and scientific advisors are experts in CR, qualitative and quantitative research, patient-
reported outcome measures, and clinical trials. The combination of mentorship, formal coursework, and the
proposed research studies will position Dr. McCarthy to become an independent NIH investigator while
advancing knowledge on how to improve health status for persons with type 2 MI."

This is a new program for “Training in Translating Neuroscience to Therapies” at Rutgers University. Its overall
objective is to provide scientists in training performing laboratory-based experiments the skills and competencies
needed to advance their discoveries to treatments for neurological disorders. The aims of the program are to: 1)
provide a continuum of comprehensive training that advances translational neuroscience research towards
therapeutic developments; 2) expand the pipeline of translational neuroscience researchers within a diverse
cohort of trainees; and 3) leverage Rutgers’ strengths in neuroscience drug discovery and development to
provide broad experiences to trainees in this program. The rationale for establishing this program is the
increasing burden of neurological diseases globally, many of which have no good treatments much less cures,
and the accelerated advances in scientific discoveries in the genetics and molecular pathogenesis of nervous
system disorders. Thus, this is an opportune time to harness knowledge gained in our understanding of disease
processes, fill in the gaps in this knowledge base, and translate basic discoveries to deliverables for patients
suffering from these disorders. The design of the training program combines traditional coursework, seminars,
conferences, a biostatistics curriculum, and an annual retreat, along with experiential learning through a series
of apprenticeships with experts in fields that link scientific innovation with industry to advance laboratory
discoveries to clinical trials. Trainees will learn from neurologists and trialists, and actively engage in clinical
trials. The training period for each participant is two years. A total of two positions are requested in year one,
and four positions in subsequent years. The trainees will include senior graduate students, MD/PhD students
and postdoctoral fellows at a ratio of 1:1:2. Trainees will work in the laboratories of highly qualified neuroscientists
and translational investigators employing multidisciplinary approaches to learn the principles of rigorous and
reproducible research. They will also have mentors with expertise in medicinal chemistry, drug discovery and
development, clinical research and trials, start-ups, and career opportunities. Faculty and trainees will benefit
from a formal mentoring program in place at Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences. Program oversight
includes internal and external advisory boards, and an Executive Committee consisting of senior leadership at
Rutgers University with extensive experience in translational and clinical research, pharmaceutical development,
commercialization of innovations, and graduate and postgraduate education. The quality and effectiveness of
the training program will be assessed by an independent assessor. The intended outcome of this program is to
train the next generation of leaders in translational neuroscience who have the knowhow and passion to take
basic discoveries to clinical trials and treatments that benefit millions with neurological diseases."
10815761,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common urinary condition that many women experience after vaginal
delivery. It is reported that ~55% of pregnant women have symptoms of urinary incontinence. While ~20-45% of
this population experience persistent SUI after vaginal delivery, the remaining population is still at risk to develop
incontinence later in life despite the spontaneous recovery. The damage to the pudendal nerve (PN) after vaginal
delivery causes decreased expression of regenerative cytokines and neurotrophins (i.e., brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF)) followed by subsequent denervation of the external urethral sphincter (EUS). It has
been shown that the specific targeting of PN using direct electrical stimulation (ES) can provide PN regeneration
via neurotrophin secretion (i.e., BDNF) of injured neurons and endogenous Schwann Cells (SC) and can be
considered as a potential alternative for SUI treatment. However, clinical translation of this approach may be
challenging due to the following reasons: (1) PN is difficult to locate because of its anatomical course leading to
difficulties in fixing the electrodes. (2) ES can only be applied intraoperatively during the surgery (only once for
~1 hour). (3) Postoperative multiple ES is difficult to apply due to invasive and blind penetration of electrodes
lacking precise, accurate, and local treatment. (4) ES via metal electrodes requires professional personnel and
does not allow on-demand self-treatment. In this project, a piezoelectric material-based biodegradable and
implantable platform is proposed as an alternative approach to enable wireless, local, and on-demand mechano-
electrical stimulation (MES) of PN for postoperative SUI treatment. For this purpose, three aims will be pursued
to complete the feasibility studies. In Aim 1, flexible cuff electrode-integrated piezoelectric platform will be
designed, fabricated, and characterized. The generated piezoelectric response and in vitro degradation profile
will be determined to control MES conditions. In Aim 2, the in vitro performance of the piezoelectric platform will
be evaluated in terms of biocompatibility, safety, and therapeutic efficacy. A pilot in vivo study will also be
conducted for evaluating the surgical procedure and implantation of the platform along with the in vivo
biocompatibility and biodegradability. In Aim 3, therapeutic performance of generated MES by the implanted
platform will be validated on rat SUI model. The subthreshold MES value will be determined, and the in vivo
therapeutic efficacy of piezoelectric platform will be evaluated by running wheel exercise and detailed
histochemical and functional recovery tests. The successful completion of these aims will introduce an
innovatively engineered piezoelectric platform enabling local, wireless, and postoperative MES of PN. In the long
term, this piezoelectric platform can be synergistically combined with Kegel exercise to provide local MES upon
rehabilitative Kegel movements to promote PN regeneration and reinnervation, a pioneering and innovative
strategy that can generate a paradigm shift in the urology field for SUI treatment."
10850679,"Project Summary
Drawing from the rich ethnic diversity of our rural region, we propose to establish a new interdisciplinary
undergraduate (UG) training experience at East Carolina University (ECU). Our program will enhance STEM
retention and matriculation in PhD and MD/PhD programs by maximizing research opportunities for diverse
underrepresented (UR) and disadvantaged students interested in biomedical careers. Known nationally for its
high ranking in social mobility index and cost-effective education, ECU is a ten-time winner of the Higher
Education Excellence in Diversity Award and an ideal environment to foster the professional development of UR
students. Our program goals address local and nationwide disparities in STEM education: the dearth of UR
students pursuing graduate studies and the loss of UR students from STEM majors in the first two years of
baccalaureate training. We will establish a new two-phased MARC Program at ECU (MARC@ECU), drawing
from more than 700 exceptionally qualified undergraduates. Phase 1 (pre-MARC) begins with career exploration
for prospective students at college orientation sessions and culminates with a new Sophomore level course
(Introduction to Research) and innovative new Research Shadowing Program, both designed to make the
process of research more visible and tangible. From this pool of students, we will recruit six Junior level students
annually into the MARC-funded Phase 2, where trainees complete a structured interdisciplinary curriculum in
their major of interest focused on science communication, rigorous scientific methods and analyses, and
professional development in preparation for doctoral careers. Mentored undergraduate research experiences
are well-established high-impact practices that prepare students for doctoral programs and are the centerpiece
of our program, culminating in student composition of a Disciplinary Honors Thesis suitable for publication.
Leveraging the unique resources at ECU, including a university-level Office for Undergraduate Research, the
MARC@ECU draws together 31 diverse faculty mentors whose work generally falls into four major sub-
disciplines of biomedical research. The MARC@ECU will build a stronger, more collaborative research
community among UG researchers by pairing them with peer and faculty mentors in a mixture of social and
professional development activities and expanded alumni networking opportunities. Although only six students
from each cohort will receive MARC support, the other students in each Phase 1 cohort well be well-prepared
for other related programs designed to support UR students in STEM already in place, including more than 14
sections of team-centered course-based undergraduate research experiences. In the long-term, these
programs along with MARC will help ECU enhance our inclusive environment and foster an immersive
undergraduate research community that will nurture our students to develop their innate skills and strengths.
The MARC program is an important next step towards creating an institutional shift towards advanced degrees
in biomedicine that are likely to have long-lasting impact on our region."
10877820,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 While mice are essential models for many areas of neuroscience, there are also many aspects of
higher brain function and dysfunction that cannot be adequately modeled in rodents. Thus, there is a need for
new genetic models that have brain structure and function closer to humans. For these reasons, non-human
primates (NHP) provide an attractive model to study higher brain function and brain disorders. A promising
emerging NHP model is the common marmoset, a small New World primate that has many advantages as a
genetic model. Although the adaptation of bacterial CRISPR/Cas systems for targeted genome engineering
and model creation has revolutionized modern biology, editing of the marmoset genome is still in its infancy.
Given the significant time and money required for marmoset genome editing, new methods to increase editing
efficiency, decrease mosaicism, and identify correctly-edited embryos prior to transfer to recipient females are
critical. Additionally, new methods for controlling the zygosity of founder animals are necessary to enable
analysis of homozygous F0 animals and to avoid homozygous editing when targeting essential genes that
cause embryonic lethality upon biallelic disruption. To these ends, we propose a research program that will
significantly enhance our ability to introduce multiple types of edits into the marmoset genome, reduce
mosaicism, control the zygosity of edits, and identify successfully edited embryos through prenatal genetic
testing. We will disseminate these technologies and models through direct resource sharing, in-person
trainings, deposition to NIH-supported Marmoset Coordination Center. Together, the proposed advances will
significantly reduce the time, effort, costs and animal numbers necessary to marmoset genetic models and will
unlock the true potential of marmosets for basic and translational neuroscience research."

According to the American Cancer Society, more than 60,000 people will develop head and neck cancer this
year and those patients must receive radiation therapy to survive. This treatment regularly destroys the salivary
glands (SG), leading to a loss of secretory function which is typically permanent. Current treatments remain
largely ineffective, with therapeutic interventions being limited to use of saliva substitutes with modest
effectiveness and medications that provide only temporary relief. In light of the high degree of need and the
limitations of current therapies, development of alternative treatments to restore SG functioning is essential. In
response to the challenges noted above, we propose introduction of FGF7 and FGF10, both of which activate
FGF2b signaling to promote SG epithelial morphogenesis and differentiation (Aims 1 and 2, in vitro and in vivo,
respectively). Having fortified our scaffold to enhance SG morphogenesis and differentiation, we will
nonetheless still be faced with absent or poorly developed vasculature and nerve systems, as indicated by
repeated studies demonstrating loss of vascularization and innervation in irradiated SG. In response to these
challenges, we will draw on our previous findings indicating VEGF and FGF9 to aid vascular formation and
neurotrophic factors (e.g., NGF) to promote innervation (Aim 3). We hypothesize that a modified FH scaffold
containing immobilized L1 peptides (L1p) and GF (L1p-GF-FH) will promote formation of functional tissue in
irradiated SG. Aim 1: will demonstrate sustained secretory function using a fortified scaffold in vitro. We will
determine whether incorporation of FGF7 and FGF10 into the L1p-FH (termed Ep-FH) scaffold allows secretory
function to remain intact for an extended duration in irradiated SG. Aim 2: will demonstrate sustained secretory
function using a fortified scaffold in vivo. We will determine whether incorporation of FGF7 and FGF10 into the
L1p-FH (termed Ep-FH) scaffold allows secretory function to remain intact for an extended duration in an
irradiated SMG mouse model. Aim 3: will restore full functionality to irradiated SG in vivo. We will combine our
Ep-FH scaffold with polymeric microparticles to release pro-angiogenic and pro-innervation GF in a temporal
sequence, mimicking the in vivo physiology, to enhance functional recovery of SMG following radiation
treatment. In summary, our proposed studies will extend our findings to date using L1p to restore SG function,
thereby allowing for both greater sustainability and a deeper degree of functionality."
10841711,"This study will establish the molecular mechanism linking mild repetitive traumatic brain injury (mrTBI) and onset
of tau pathology that is associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Our preliminary data suggest that endoplasmic
reticulum stress is a notable and long-lasting cascade that is activated by injury. ER stress activates a protein
called PERK, which is responsible for initiating protective pathways that help restore ER function. However, long-
term activation of PERK leads to cell death. Brain cells are particularly susceptible to PERK-mediated cell death.
Indeed, a common sign between TBI and AD is PERK hyperactivity. We recently established that another com-
mon pathological hallmark of TBI and AD, abnormal aggregation of the protein tau, is driven by chronic activation
of PERK. PERK induces tau to adopt toxic conformations that are associated with disease. Therefore, the overall
hypothesis of this project is that TBI induces long-lasting activation of PERK, which in turn catalyzes the formation
of pathological tau species. This ultimately leads to increased risk for AD. We will test our hypotheses using
mouse models in two aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the conditions under which mrTBI causes activation of
PERK. To accomplish this objective, mice will be subjected to mrTBI at different intensities and for different time
points, and the levels of active PERK will be measured. In addition, we will determine the extent of tissue that
shows PERK activity. In Aim 2, we will manipulate PERK activity in mouse models of tauopathy that have suffered
mrTBI. We expect that PERK activation will cause more tau pathology and induce damage to brain function.
Conversely, PERK inhibition will restore brain function and prevent tau pathology. Aim 3 will determine the va-
lidity of using PERK as a biomarker of TBI. Our preliminary data suggest that individuals who suffered one or
more TBIs in their lifetime have two times more active/total PERK ratio in their blood. These data support our
enthusiasm to expand our studies into a much larger cohort. If successful, this grant will not only identify a
molecular mechanism that links injury and AD, but it will also highlight a key pathological pathway replete with
therapeutic targets. Logical extensions of these studies involve testing inhibitors of the PERK pathway for po-
tential therapeutic value. It will also offer relief to the 1.7 million people in the United States who suffer a TBI
annually. Our expertise in ER stress, PERK, tau, AD, and TBI makes us uniquely suited to accomplish the pro-
posed work. In addition, the unique resources available to my lab, such as small animal MR imaging, cohort
biospecimens and clinical histories, and the UF Viral Production Core have strengthened the impact of our work
and brought us closer to understanding the mechanisms of tau-mediated neurotoxic events stemming from the
ER."

This application seeks funds for 5 years, to continue the current NIH-funded T32 program for Minority
Health and Aging at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), to support 3 pre-doctoral and 1 postdoctoral
trainees per year. The program aims to increase and improve the pool of researchers with relevant
expertise to help address challenges raised by the growing diversity in aging of the United States population.
Given our strengths in the areas of Hispanic/Latino aging with a multi-disciplinary, population-based perspective,
we focus on factors related to health disparities involving these populations as well as under-represented groups
in general.
The post-doctoral fellows and the pre-doctoral students are housed in the Sealy Center on Aging, with
which most T32 faculty are affiliated. The pre-doctoral students receive their degree from the School of Public
and Population Health, and benefit by interacting with PhD students in other programs, funded by AHRQ and by
the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. Our faculty have a long history of epidemiological, social and
behavioral research on aging with particular strengths in Hispanic population aging. Of relevance to the proposed
T32 is that UTMB is currently the home of two large population-based, longitudinal, cohort studies funded by the
National Institute on Aging - the Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemiological Study of the Elderly
(Hispanic EPESE) and the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS). Our faculty hold multiple investigator-initiated
grants, as well as multi-disciplinary research infrastructure grants on aging, including a Pepper Center
for Independent Older Adults and a Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR).
The 26 faculty members affiliated with the T32 program represent research strengths in multiple
disciplines - epidemiology, demography, anthropology, sociology, economics, public health, rehabilitation
sciences, geriatrics, and health policy. They also represent five schools and various departments across the
campus. Our plan is to build on our strengths and train scientists in social/ behavioral and epidemiological
approaches related to aging in Hispanic/Latino populations as well as health disparities in general. As in our
current program, we will make special efforts to recruit trainees from under-represented backgrounds, while all
our trainees will focus their research on the health of minority older adults. Compared to our previous grant, new
in our proposed program are: a) expanded group of mentors in the training program, b} a larger recruitment pool
for pre-doctoral trainees, and c) one new area of development for trainees: skills for growing in diverse teams,
including diversity in disciplines, race/ethnicity, gender, and seniority composition of the research teams."

Chemical Biology tools for probing, manipulating, and imaging biological systems can provide
deep insights into fundamental processes. Chemical dimerization and protein localization
strategies, fluorescent probes and sensors for analyte detection, and small molecules for
perturbing biological pathways and process have become important research tools for gleaning
deeper insight into biological processes. The development of optically triggered variants of these
important chemical biology tools has provided new and more powerful approaches to probing,
manipulating, and imaging key pathways and processes with new levels of spatial and temporal
control not previously available. Despite the utility of molecular chemical biology approaches,
many of the tools and reagents are not readily available due to the need for on-demand synthesis
and molecular customization depending on the pathways and processes being studied and the
lack of commercially availability. The proposed Chemical Biology and Materials Core will solve
these problems by working directly with the individual projects of the program to design,
synthesize, and implement cutting edge Chemical biology tools customized to the project
research aims. The Chemical Biology Core will also serve as a resource throughout the award
period to develop new approaches and implement key technologies in synergy with the MAC core
and individual projects. In Aim 1 the core will develop chemical dimerizers for optogenetic control
of key biomolecule localization and activation events. In Aim 2 the core will develop peptide based
chemical probes for interrogation of key biological pathways and processes."

multidisciplinary mentoring committee, drawn from a mentor pool of 34 MD and PhD genomic medicine
researchers. This highly collaborative mentor community possesses expertise in the many disciplines that
underpin genomic medicine, including human genetics, bioinformatics, epidemiology, statistics, molecular
diagnostics, and pharmacogenomics. Trainees will benefit from several unique resources and collaborators in
the Center for Genomic Medicine: the Utah Genome Project, an independently funded research project in which
thousands of members of large Utah disease pedigrees are undergoing whole-genome sequencing; the Utah
Center for Genetic Discovery, the University’s computational genomics engine and hub for development of
software tools and algorithms for genome interpretation; ARUP Laboratories, the University’s national reference
lab and a leader in developing genomics-based clinical diagnostic tests; the Penelope Program, the University’s
clinic for rare and undiagnosed disease, which is part of the Undiagnosed Disease Network; the Utah NeoSeq
Project, an initiative to bring rapid whole genome sequencing to the neonatal intensive care unit; and the
Huntsman Cancer Institute, a National Cancer Institute Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center and home to
extensive cancer genomics and precision oncology projects. Each of these will provide immersion opportunities
in genomic medicine. The overall goals of the T32 program are: to teach trainees to apply cutting-edge
bioinformatics and computational tools to analyze genomic datasets; to work productively with interdisciplinary
teams in the clinical application of genomic data; to protect and communicate effectively with research
participants; and to advance an independent research career in genomic medicine. At steady state, the training
program will include five predoctoral and four postdoctoral trainees each year. In the past funding period, nine
postdoctoral trainees were appointed, advancing their careers in genomic medicine. Trainee outcomes data are
tracked, and best practices and course materials will be disseminated across the NHGRI training network."
10829855,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Newborn screening (NBS) is one of the most successful public health programs that provides cost-effective early
diagnosis of treatable disorders. The basis of NBS is to quantify a biomarker that is indicative of disease in a
dried blood spot (DBS). It was projected that 60 cell and gene therapies could be approved by the FDA within
10 years, which underscores an urgent need to modernize the NBS system. A major challenge for NBS of many
treatable genetic disorders is the unavailability of a biomarker in DBS, because there is no accumulation of small
molecules in patients. In this proposed studies, it is also not feasible to measure the biological function of the
protein (i.e. enzyme assay or other functional assays). Instead, reduction in the abundance of a specific protein
(encoded by the disease-causing gene) can be used for the diagnosis of genetic diseases as many genetic
conditions are caused by mutations that lead to non-functional proteins that are quickly degraded, as exemplified
in Wilson disease. Given the complexity of the DBS sample and the typical low-abundance nature of target
proteins, a technique called Immuno-SRM (Immunocapture coupled to selected-reaction-monitoring, or SRM)
had been successfully developed to quantify proteins in DBS. One drawback of our current Immuno-SRM for
NBS is that the LC-MS/MS time is about 3-4 min per sample. In this study, we propose a novel idea of expanded
multiplexing by using newborn-specific peptide mass tags to greatly increase the throughput of proteomic-based
NBS. Tagging of peptides with mass-differentiated tags allows samples from multiple newborns to be analyzed
in the same LC-MS/MS run. The objective of this application is to develop Immuno-SRM multiplex assay to
quantify 19 peptides for NBS of 12 genetic conditions including tuberous sclerosis. Successful implementation
of the project will enable the screening of 12 diseases simultaneously using a single DBS sample with a MS
instrument time < 1 min per sample. The goal will be achieved through the following specific aims. (1) Develop
an Immuno-SRM method to quantify TSC2 for tuberous sclerosis that is suitable for newborn screening.
Considering that we have already developed monoclonal antibodies (mAb, which is used to enrich surrogate
peptides for disease-specific proteins) for all conditions except TSC, the first aim is to raise mAb against TSC2
surrogate peptides and develop an Immuno-SRM for its quantification followed by optimization for multiplex
analysis. (2) Development of peptide tagging for increasing the throughput of Immuno-SRM assays.
Tagging of peptides with mass-differentiated tags allows samples from multiple newborns (>4 samples) to be
analyzed in the same LC-MS/MS run (equivalent to individual barcode sequences for next-generation-
sequencing). (3) Performance evaluation of the multiplexed Immuno-SRM method. First, the workflow will
be tested on known patient samples for its sensitivity. Second, a mini-pilot study on 3000 random newborn DBS
will be performed to test the robustness of the method."
10775753,"Summary Abstract
 This application puts for the notion of a brain-gut- retinal axis that becomes dysfunctional in diabetic
retinopathy (DR). The innate immune system has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of DR,
but less is known about the role of the adaptive immune system. At the interface of these two systems is
a critical population of cells, Th17 cells, that typically reside in the gut during health. Th17 cells have
homeostatic properties, mediating host defense against bacterial and fungal infections; however, it
remains unclear how intestinal Th17 cells integrate diverse signals into a set of cellular programs that
allow them to maintain tissue homeostasis yet also become pathogenic, serving as primary drivers of
tissue inflammation. We have identified a critical role of somatostatinergic neurons in the paraventricular
nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in regulation of immune function through “loss of function” studies
and “gain of function studies. SST expression is dramatically reduced in the PVN of diabetic animals.
Hypothalamic dysfunction, as seen in diabetes, has the capacity to induce injury directly through
hyperactivation of sympathetic nerves. Based on preliminary and published data, we put for the
hypothesis that: Diabetes-induced loss of inhibitory SST neurons in the PVN drives increased autonomic
input to the intestine shifting Th17 cells from a homeostatic to a pathologic state. Pathologic Th17 cells
leave the intestine and traffic to areas of tissue injury such as the retina in DR. In the retina the
pathologic Th17 cells secrete proinflammatory cytokines that recruitment innate immune cells into the
retina exacerbating DR. To examine this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: To test if
impaired function of hypothalamic SST neurons in diabetes contributes to hyperactivity of autonomic
efferents to the gut and increases activation of enteric neurons. Aim 2: To selectively ablate SST PVN
neurons (in the absence of diabetes) and evaluate if this results in increased autonomic input to the gut
and a shift from “homeostatic” Th17 cells to a “pathogenic” Th17 cells that migrate to the retina and
recruit circulating immune cells. Aim 3: To determine if maintaining hypothalamic SST levels at
nondiabetic levels in diabetic mice will preserve the function of homeostatic Th17 cells in the gut and
prevent their recruitment to the retina delaying the development of DR. Impact: SST analogues may
provide an important complementary strategy for DR management by preventing increased sympathetic
drive to the gut and Th17 cell dysfunction."

 Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) is a developmental cardiovascular disease, occurring alone or in
Williams Beuren Syndrome (WBS), and results in excessive arterial smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation
and lumen obstruction. Our long-term objective is to elucidate how this pathology can be attenuated.
Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations or deletions of the elastin gene ELN cause SVAS. Eln(-/-) embryos and
Eln(+/-) neonatal mice develop arterial disease with features similar to human SVAS4-6. Elastin forms the major
component of the elastic lamellae in arteries. Defective lamellae are associated with excessive developmental
SMC proliferation in SVAS. If untreated, SVAS results in heart failure and an increased risk of sudden death,
and major surgery, which carries substantial risk, is the only treatment. Medical therapies are lacking because
mechanisms linking defective elastin and SMC hypermuscularization are incompletely defined. We aim to
elucidate molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying elastin aortopathy.
 The Notch pathway is critical in regulating SMC biology, and we recently reported a role for Notch in
SVAS pathogenesis (JCI, 2022). Signaling via Notch ligand Jagged1 (JAG1) and NOTCH3 receptor in SMCs
activates proliferation. Our studies reveal that JAG1-NOTCH3 pathway components are upregulated after
elastin depletion. Importantly, we determined that inhibiting the NOTCH3 pathway in Eln(-/-) embryos attenuates
aortic hypermuscularization and stenosis and reverses established hypermuscularization in Eln(+/-) pups.
 Epigenetic modifications influence gene expression by altering chromatin accessibility but prior to our
JCI paper, have not been explored in elastin deficiency. Our initial data indicate that elastin deficient aortas
and SMCs display reduced DNA methylation, elevated histone acetylation and reduced expression of DNA
methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). We hypothesize that elastin deficiency
attenuates DNMT1- and HDAC1-mediated repression of Notch pathway genes to promote aortic
hypermuscularization and stenosis. The proposed studies use cell culture, mouse models, de-identified human
samples and advanced genomic and epigenetic techniques to uncover mechanisms of SVAS that can be
therapeutically targeted. We will test our hypothesis in two aims. Aim 1 will determine how elastin deficiency
alters epigenetic mediators and the epigenetic landscape in human and murine SMCs, including 1a) identifying
elastin-regulated epigenetic enzymes, 1b) determining mechanisms by which elastin deficiency modulates
epigenetic regulators, 1c) an integrated genome-wide epigenetic and transcriptomic analysis to identify new
regulatory mechanisms and 1d) characterization of epigenetic enzymes and marks in human samples. Aim 2

models of SVAS. These studies promise to yield new treatments for this lethal genetic disease."
10746844,"Down syndrome (DS) is a congenital condition resulting from partial or complete triplication of
human chromosome 21. Virtually all the subjects with DS develop widespread neuropathology
including amyloid- neuritic plaques, synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration, reminiscent of
Alzheimer's disease. While the extra copy of amyloid- precursor protein (APP) on chromosome
21 is thought to play a major role in the development of this type of pathologic phenotype in DS,
the underlying mechanisms responsible for these changes and their contribution to
neurodegeneration are still elusive. Compelling evidence supports the hypothesis that
physiological cellular proteostasis is of critical importance for neuronal health and that the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a master regulator of this vital cellular function.
However, while we know that the system is altered in DS we do not know whether it plays a
functional role in the pathogenesis of DS and the onset of neuropathology. In our preliminary data
we found that compared with healthy matched controls mTOR is hyperactive in selected brain
regions of DS patients. Importantly, we observed that in the same subjects the dysfunction directly
correlates with the pathology. Moreover, we show that mTOR is altered in the brain of a well-
established mouse model of DS, the Ts65Dn mice, at an early stage of the phenotype, and
associates with biochemical evidence of cell loss, suggesting a link between mTOR,
neuropathology and neurodegeneration in DS subjects. Taking into consideration the scientific
rigor of the previously published literature together with our recent findings we now propose a
novel working hypothesis: alteration of mTOR signaling pathway is responsible for the onset of
the neuropathologic DS phenotype and represents a novel and viable therapeutic target against
it in DS subjects. In this proposal, we will assess the temporal relationship between dysregulation
of mTOR in the brain of DS patients and the development of the neuropathology. We will then
focus on investigating early events responsible for this dysregulation in the same DS subjects.
Next, to prove its direct role in the pathogenesis of the syndrome, we will study the effect that
modulation of mTOR activity and expression levels has on behavior impairments and
neuropathology using in vivo models of DS. The results of our proposed studies will elucidate
early changes and the functional consequences of altered proteostasis secondary to dysregulated
mTOR in the development of the neuropathologic phenotype in individuals with DS. Importantly,
our findings have the potential to identify new therapeutic opportunities for delaying its onset and
/or halting its progression."
10809785,"Project Summary
The etiology of acute kidney injury (AKI), a common disease, can be multifactorial and currently has no FDA-
approved drugs for its prevention or treatment. Emerging evidence from laboratory and clinical studies
suggests the pathogenesis involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, activation of inflammatory and
apoptotic pathways; therefore, regulating these pathways offer protection. Given the antioxidant, anti-
inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects of urolithin A (UA), a gut microbial metabolite of ellagic acid, the aim of
this project is to explore the therapeutic potential of UA in AKI. However, UA's therapeutic potential is
constrained by poor bioavailability. The work enabled by previous findings, in which oral delivery of UA was
achieved by biodegradable nanoparticles that utilize a surface conjugated ligand targeting the gut-expressed
transferrin receptor. Nanoparticle encapsulation of UA led to a ~7 and ~6-fold enhancement in oral
bioavailability compared to native UA in healthy rodents and dogs respectively. Treatment with nanoparticle UA
also significantly attenuated the histopathological hallmarks of cisplatin-induced AKI and reduced mortality by
63% in the mouse model. This project will further develop UA as a potential therapeutic for treating AKI,
considering the fact that cisplatin is utilized only in individuals with cancer who are administered repeated low
doses in the clinic. The overall goal will be accomplished by pursuing the following independent specific aims.
Aim 1, will define the extent to which structural elements of the delivery system and the pathophysiology can
influence UA bioavailability. Aim 2, will assess the protective benefits of the most bioavailable form of UA in
dose and age dependent cisplatin-induced AKI, as well as desired and undesired effects of UA combined with
cisplatin in cancer setting. Aim 3 will establish efficacy of UA against cisplatin-induced AKI in healthy dogs
(non-cancerous), who will be re-homed as pets at the end of the study. At the end of the proposed studies, we
will understand and fully be able to describe how effective delivery influences the pharmacology of UA, with
regards to both desired and undesired effects in mice and dog models. The knowledge gained will be valuable
in developing UA as not only an oral therapeutic for AKI and for other vascular and neuroinflammatory
diseases in which plain UA has shown some benefit, but also as an adjuvant in combination therapies for
cancer treatment, where immediate clinical testing in dogs (cancer patients) can be carried out."
10821388,"TALE family transcription factors (TFs) are ubiquitously expressed and act as cofactors to several classes of
essential TFs – most prominently Hox proteins – in embryogenesis and cellular homeostasis, but their exact
functions remain enigmatic. For instance, two family members – Prep and Meis – bind identical sequence
motifs in vitro and share the ability to dimerize with Pbx proteins, suggesting that they function interchangeably.
However, loss-of-function analyses in several systems suggest that their roles diverge in vivo. Furthermore, a
third TALE family member (TGIF) shares DNA binding motif preference with Prep and Meis, but it is unclear if
these three TFs compete or compensate for each other in vivo. Because most known TFs belong to larger
families that share DNA and protein:protein interaction properties, similar questions about shared and
divergent functions vex our understanding of most TF families. Further, since TF function in vivo is subject to
constraints not encountered in vitro, it is essential to evaluate their functional properties in native systems.
Indeed, numerous fundamental questions about TF activity remain to be addressed in vivo. Perhaps most
importantly, do TFs with similar in vitro binding selectivity select distinct motifs in vivo? What is the mechanistic
basis of divergent in vivo binding selectivity and how does it impact function? The answers to these questions
will have profound implications for our understanding of embryogenesis and disease, but progress in this area
has been hampered by major barriers. Specifically, access to multiple genome-wide data sets for closely
related TFs has been limited – particularly during embryogenesis, when cell numbers are often small. We have
addressed this by generating ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data for members of the TALE family of TFs at multiple
stages of zebrafish development – thereby establishing one of the most comprehensive sets of data available
for a single TF family. In spite of containing near-identical homeodomains and binding to indistinguishable
motifs in vitro, we find that Prep and Meis TFs display divergent binding preferences in vivo. Also, Prep, but not
Meis, occupies a novel non-Hox related genomic element in vivo. These initial observations underscore the
importance of exploring TF function in their native environment and highlight the strong technical and
conceptual position of our research group to pursue these analyses further. Based on our preliminary findings,
we hypothesize that emergent in vivo constraints restrict TALE TF motif selectivity and that dynamic
exchange among TALE members controls transcriptional outcome. To test this hypothesis, we will first
express wild-type and domain-swapped TF constructs in zebrafish to define the mechanistic basis of TALE TF
binding selectivity in vivo. Second, we will use gain- and loss-of-function approaches to manipulate the balance
of TALE TFs in order to define the functional consequences of different TALE TFs occupying the same
genomic binding sites in vivo. Lastly, we will use loss-of-function animals and CRISPR-mediated deletions to
examine the in vivo role for a novel TALE-occupied motif. Since TALE TFs are implicated in several cancers,
our in vivo delineation of the dynamic interplay between TALE family members will directly impact our
understanding of both embryogenesis and oncogenesis. Conceptually, our findings will also be applicable to
other homeodomain TFs (constituting the 2nd largest class of TFs) and other multi-member TF families."
10817122,"Iron is a transition metal that exists in two pools within cells. Chelatable iron comprises free iron and iron
loosely bound to anionic metabolites like ATP and citrate, whereas non-chelatable iron is tightly bound to ferritin,
heme and iron-sulfur clusters. Redox active chelatable iron promotes oxidative stress by catalyzing the Fenton
reaction, which produces highly reactive hydroxyl radicals that damage DNA, proteins and membranes. Much
evidence implicates mitochondrial iron as an important contributor to toxicity, but the molecular pathways of
mitochondrial iron uptake are incompletely understood. Current dogma is that mitoferrin (Mfrn1 and 2), a 
mitochondrial inner membrane protein, is responsible for mitochondrial iron transport. However, studies from 45
years ago show that the classical electrogenic mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex also catalyzes
uptake of Fe2+ but not Fe3+ driven by the mitochondrial membrane potential, a conclusion supported by our own
studies in intact and permeabilized cells. Our preliminary pull-down, Duolink and super-resolution microscopy
studies show a physical association of Mfrn2, the predominant isoform in non-erythroid cells, with MCU, the core
protein of the MCU complex. This brings us to the fundamental questions to be addressed by this proposal: 1)
Do mitochondria accumulate iron via two independent pathways: a non-electrogenic pathway mediated by Mfrn
and an electrogenic pathway catalyzed by MCU? 2) Alternatively do Mfrn and the molecular components of MCU
exist within a single complex mediating both Fe2+ and Ca2+ uptake? 3) Is Mfrn an exchanger, such as an
Fe2+/Na+(H+) exchanger in analogy to Ca2+/Na+, Mg2+/Na+, and Na+/H+ exchangers? 4) How do MCU and Mfrn,
as well as divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), contribute to hepatotoxicity? In Aim 1, we will characterize 
mitochondrial Fe2+ uptake and exchange in plasma membrane-permeabilized wildtype (WT), MCU knockout (KO)
and Mfrn1/2 double KO (DKO) hepatocytes. Aim 2 will identify interactions of Mfrn2 with other proteins using an
unbiased enrichment-mass spectrometric (AE-MS) approach, DuoLink and super-resolution microscopy to 
establish whether or not Mfrn2 and MCU are authentic binding partners and also to identify associations of Mfrn2
with other novel partners. Aim 3 will assess how targeted mutations affect susceptibility to acetaminophen
(APAP) toxicity, which is mediated by iron. Specifically, we will determine how deficiencies of MCU, Mfrn2 and
DMT1 affect APAP-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and hepatocellular killing in vitro and in vivo. We expect
these studies to define the specific roles of MCU, Mfrn2 and DMT1 in this clinically relevant model of 
hepatocellular injury. The concept that Mfrn and MCU are both essential for both mitochondrial Fe2+ uptake and homeo-stasis is novel, innovative and paradigm-shifting. The project will provide insights into an unexplored area of
biology and fill an important gap in our understanding of the pathways involved in mitochondrial iron uptake and
iron-dependent toxicities. Better understanding of the process will eventually lead to more specific interventions
against hepatic diseases promoted by iron overload."
10813165,"Disorders of the branched chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism are the most common of the organic
acidemias identified by newborn screening. The catabolism of leucine (LEU), isoleucine (ILE), and valine (VAL)
begins through a set of common transporters and enzymes localized to the mitochondria. Thereafter, the
pathways diverge. Four disorders in these pathways share enormous unmet needs for treatment: maple syrup
urine disease (MSUD), and isovaleric (IVA), propionic (PA), and methylmalonic acidemias (MMA). This is a
renewal application for a project with a long-term goal to characterize BCAA acid metabolism and its
deficiencies. Significant progress has been made on each aim of the original project, and our results have
provided unique opportunities to study novel therapies. This new application has three specific aims. Specific
Specific Aim 1 is to continue characterization of the mitochondrial architecture of BCAA metabolism. Based
on our data, I hypothesize that the catabolic enzymes of LEU and ILE/VAL comprise two separate metabolons
within the mitochondrial matrix. Specific Aim 1a is to examine the physical interactions of BCKADH, IVDH,
and 3MCC as a putative metabolon using STED and cryo-CLEM, and cryo-ET techniques. Specific Aim 1b is
to examine the interactions of the enzymes involved in BCAA catabolism using protein cross linking and co-
immunoprecipitation studies. Specific Aim 2 is to identify novel small molecules to treat IVDH and BCKADH
deficiency, either as substrate inhibitors or chemical chaperonins to improve folding of IVDH to restore partial
flux through the leucine pathway. I hypothesize that small molecule inhibitors of BCAT will reduce
accumulation of toxic intermediates of these disorders, while inhibitors of distal enzymes in the LEU pathway
will induce accumulation of proximal substrates and stabilize mutant enzymes. Specific Aim 2a is to examine
effects of a panel of BCAA catabolism inhibitors on IVDH and BCKADH stability and function in cells from
patients with IVA and MSUD. I predict that these molecules will stabilize mutant IVDH and BCKADH proteins,
making them compelling candidates for further preclinical drug development. Specific Aim 2b is to examine
the effect of a BCAT inhibitor on flux through BCAA catabolism, and accumulation of toxic metabolites in cells
from patients with IVA and MSUD. I predict that this compound will reduce accumulation of toxic metabolites in
cells, identifying it as a potential therapy for IVA and MSUD. Specific Aim 3 is to examine mitochondrial ETC
and TCA cycle dysfunction in cells from patients with PA and MMA. I hypothesize that correction of such
defects will allow development of therapeutic agents for these disorders. Specific Aim 3a is to examine the
use of novel mitochondrial antioxidants to reverse secondary ETC dysfunction in cells from patients with MMA
and PA. Specific Aim 3b is to examine the effect of restoring TCA cycle imbalance in cells from patients with
PA and MMA on bioenergetic imbalance. I propose to study a set of novel synthetic anaplerotic agents in
patient cells. I hypothesize that these compounds will be better than existing agent in reversing abnormalities."
10804636,"SUMMARY
Between 30-40% of American adults have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which currently has no
therapeutic options and is predicted to become the leading cause of the liver failure in the US. NAFLD is initiated
by excess lipid accumulation in the liver (i.e. hepatic steatosis). The well-established risk variants TM6SF2
rs58542926 (E167K) and PNPLA3 rs738409 (I148M) both lead to increased cellular lipid accumulation. While
patient-derived cell-based models are a valuable tool for the discovery of novel genetic factors, most NAFLD
models are based on liver-derived or hepatocyte-like cells, which are time-intensive and costly to generate. Since
steatosis is a cell autonomous phenotype, we propose an entirely novel approach of using patient-derived
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in their undifferentiated state as a NAFLD genetic model. In preliminary
studies we found that oleate-treated iPSC both before and after differentiation into hepatocyte-like cells (iHeps)
with the TM6SF2 rs58542926-T risk allele have greater lipid accumulation compared to non-carriers, differences
that were not completely rescued after gene editing to revert rs58542926 to the non-risk allele. This finding
highlights the potential for iPSCs and iHeps to interrogate the genetic predisposition to NAFLD, as well as
suggests that the association between rs58542926 and NAFLD is not driven by TM6SF2 alone. rs58542926 is
in near perfect linkage disequilibrium with rs10401969, which regulates SUGP1 protein levels. In pilot studies,
SUGP1 knock-down increased triglyceride levels in human hepatoma cell lines, while knock-down in vivo
resulted in hepatic steatosis. While our findings implicate SUGP1 rs10401069 as an additional causal variant for
NAFLD, to date, mechanistic studies of this haplotype have been focused on TM6SF2 alone. In Aim 1 we
propose to test whether SUGP1 rs10401969 modulates NAFLD in cellular and animal models by: i) Identifying
NAFLD relevant cellular phenotypes that differ between iHeps from SUGP1 and rs10401969 double-carriers vs.
non-carriers; ii) Introduce the rs10401969 and rs58542926 risk-alleles in non-carriers, and test for recapitulation
of cellular phenotypes; iii) Verify that SUGP1 knock-down and overexpression modulates NAFLD in vivo; and iv)
Identify SUGP1 target genes that mediate NAFLD- phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will establish undifferentiated iPSCs
as a cellular model for NAFLD genetic risk variants by: i) Comparing NAFLD-relevant cellular phenotypes in
iPSCs compared to iHeps; ii) Confirming that iPSCs can model single SNP effects, and testing whether
phenotypes differ in iPSCs selected from the extremes of the NAFLD genetic risk score distribution; and iii)
testing for differences in cellular phenotypes in iPSCs from NAFLD cases vs. controls. Together these studies
will significantly advance the field of NAFLD genetics by defining SUGP1 as a genetic contributor to NAFLD, and
establishing iPSCs as a novel cellular model to identify and functionalize NAFLD genetic variants. The successful
implementation of these aims will reveal new biology underlying genetic drivers of NAFLD that may ultimately
be used to develop precision medicine standards for NAFLD diagnosis, screening and management."

Project 2: Functional Connectivity, Brain Development, and Outcomes in Chiari Type I Malformation
Abstract
 Chiari malformation (CM) is a challenging disease. Despite its anatomically well-defined pathology
characterized by herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, its clinical symptoms and
indications for surgical intervention are highly variable. Here we propose advanced neuroimaging with
personalized connectomics acquired longitudinally, in both surgical (pre/post posterior fossa decompression)
and non-surgical CM patients, to identify imaging markers for better disease characterization and outcome
prediction. We are using resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to measure
resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) and fractional anisotropy (FA), respectively. We are leveraging the
protocols of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (n = 11,874), to facilitate direct
comparisons to age and demographic matched control subjects from the ABCD data set, for both imaging and
cognitive/emotional metrics. In addition, we are collecting Chiari Severity Index (CSI) and Chiari Health Index in
Pediatrics (CHIP) data, both of which have been developed and validated by our team specifically for CM. The
longitudinal arm of this project includes an adult CM cohort, which will expand the number of participants for
greater power, and allow us to test developmental CM effects in the pediatric cohort. The imaging and cognitive
measures will be compared at baseline before any intervention. Then within-participant comparisons will be
made before and after posterior fossa decompression (PFD) surgery to identify novel imaging markers predictive
of disease outcomes and response to surgery."
10876283,"Project 3: Abstract
Chiari type I malformation (CM), defined for >100 years as cerebellar tonsillar ectopia through the
foramen magnum, encompasses a broad array of radiological and clinical features, with patients
ranging from essentially asymptomatic (i.e. incidental discovery) to suffering disabling
neurological symptoms from cervicomedullary compression. Indeed, this oversimplified and
outdated definition of CM depends solely on a single, static 2D sagittal MRI image, and fails to
consider the complex and dynamic pathophysiology at the interface of CM pathology involving
the cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. The objective of this proposal is to predict long term
outcomes in CM through understanding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-mediated microstructural injury.
The Central Hypotheses are that: 1) Novel MRI measures of microstructural injury are associated
with CM disease severity, functional outcome, and therapeutic response and 2) Brain-CSF
circulation is altered in symptomatic CM, is associated with microstructural injury, and responds
to neurosurgical treatment. To test these hypotheses, we will address the following Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Determine whether novel brainstem measures of microstructural injury reflect
neurological impairments and predict long-term outcomes in patients with CM.
Specific Aim 2: Determine CSF circulation in the brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord
through dynamic 4D CSF flow of the brain-CSF interfaces, their response to surgical treatment,
and relationship to microstructural injury."

10798249,"This competing renewal of the Postgraduate Training Program in Epithelial Biology, AR07422, aims to
extend 40 continuous years of NIH-supported postdoctoral training in skin research at Stanford. The
program objective is to train postdoctoral fellows for future careers in research relevant to skin diseases.
The rationale for the multi-disciplinary design of the program within the Stanford Program in Epithelial
Biology is based on the premise that future success in cutaneous biology research will be enhanced by
training interactions within a broad scientific network.
 Developments during the prior funding cycle include:
 1) Expansion of the Stanford Program in Epithelial Biology (PEB): AR07422 is the heart of the multi-
disciplinary PEB, which has grown to 74 Stanford faculty united by themes common to skin and other
epithelial tissues, including differentiation, morphogenesis, adhesion, stem cell biology, carcinogenesis,
and therapeutics, which together comprise T32 training foci. The current proposal has also expanded to
include training opportunities in translational and population sciences research, directed by world leaders in
those fields.
 2) Enrichment of the T32 training environment: Embedded among basic science faculty, the core
Dermatology labs leading this T32 have been further enriched by 24 Ph.D. students pursuing thesis efforts,
a 25% expansion in research space in 2016, new equipment, new high throughput genomics core facilities,
and a new in-lab core biocomputational training resource.
 3) Enhancement of multi-disciplinary resources available to trainees: In addition to the PEB, T32 mentors
expanded their involvement and leadership in additional multi-disciplinary programs at Stanford, spanning
Stanford Stem Cell Biology, Cancer Biology, Biomedical Data Sciences, and Genomics Programs.
 4) Acceleration of the scientific productivity of the Stanford skin research training community:
Productivity, measured by high impact papers (journal ISI impact factor >25) has accelerated, with 21 such
publications from the core Dermatology mentors over the prior funding cycle.
 5) Successful training of future PIs: 11 Research P.I.s graduated from the laboratories of the 4
Dermatology core mentors over the current funding cycle and are now Assistant Professors at institutions
that include Baylor College of Medicine (1); Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (1); University of

The Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) Collaborative Research Centers (CRCs)
Network was created in 2017 to foster multidisciplinary research to inform the etiology, pathogenesis, and
treatment of ME/CFS, a debilitating, complex, multisystem disorder that affects approximately 0.9% of the
population worldwide. Although researchers have identified multiple hypotheses for disease etiology and
differential patterns in biological processes, the underlying mechanisms that trigger ME/CFS symptoms and
their treatment remain unknown. During the next cycle of the Network, a comprehensive approach is needed
to (1) identify subtypes of ME/CFS based on biological markers and symptom classifications, (2) conduct
longitudinal studies to understand the time course of disease and its manifestations, (3) develop and validate
outcome measures for future intervention trials, and (4) identify potential treatment targets. To support these
studies, the Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC) will serve as a foundational resource to the
CRCs by providing (1) expertise in patient-centered research, data processing, and analysis; (2)
communication and social media tools to actively engage the broader ME/CFS community (e.g., ME/CFS
patients, clinicians, researchers); and (3) real-time study status dashboards to monitor CRC recruitment and
retention and track study progress. In addition, as the Network’s current DMCC, RTI is uniquely positioned to
facilitate data mining/integration and clinical data and biospecimen sharing within and outside the Network by
expanding the capabilities and reach of our publicly available online ME/CFS research tools mapMECFS and
searchMECFS. Specifically, the DMCC will continue to support the endeavors of the Network and the CRCs
and enhance our research tools to help define the cause(s) of ME/CFS and discover better diagnostics and
treatment to improve the health outcomes for individuals with ME/CFS by accomplishing our three specific
aims. Aim 1. Enable novel discovery through collaborative science by expanding the content, userbase, and
functionality of the mapMECFS data sharing portal. Aim 2. Advance ME/CFS research through our secure
online data portal with enhanced data collection, data sharing, and clinical/biospecimen linkage tools. Aim 3.
Promote research efficiency and foster collaboration and coordination by enhancing communication with
ME/CFS internal and external partners and providing logistical and administrative support to the CRCs. The
DMCC will be co-led by multiple Principal Investigators (mPIs) Linda Morris Brown, MPH, DrPH, and Matthew
Schu, PhD. Together they bring 58 years of experience in multisite consortia coordination, project
management, conducting and monitoring of observational studies, web-based data collection instruments,
specimen collection, publication of results, and sharing of de-identified data. Our mPI leadership model pairing
a senior epidemiologist, Dr. Brown, with a senior bioinformatician, Dr. Schu, will continue to be key to our

10844383,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This proposal requests continued support for the “Enhancing Pediatric Treatment Adherence and Health
Outcomes” (T32 HD068223) postdoctoral training program, which trains M.D. and Ph.D. researchers to
assume leadership roles in developing innovative, high impact research on adherence to medical treatment
and chronic illness self-management that will enhance the health outcomes of children with chronic conditions.
Modern medical treatments have improved the health outcomes of large numbers of children and adolescents
with chronic conditions. However, one of the most critical remaining barriers to improving children’s health
outcomes over the course of their lifetime is nonadherence to prescribed medical treatment. As noted by the
World Health Organization (WHO), treatment nonadherence is highly prevalent (rates of ≥ 50% in pediatric
chronic illness populations) and has a significantly negative impact on children’s health and health care costs.
 Continued innovative and clinically relevant research is needed to close the gap between the health
outcomes that are potentially achievable with more optimal treatment adherence and those achieved in current
practice. NIH program priorities and requests for applications, scientific consensus conferences, and scholarly
reviews have all identified the importance of research on pediatric adherence to treatment. A critical barrier to
scientific advances in pediatric adherence and chronic illness management research is the shortage of
talented, well-trained researchers who are devoting their careers to developing innovative, high impact
treatment adherence and self-management research with pediatric populations. One of the most promising
ways to address this need and improve child health is to develop innovative interdisciplinary research training
programs to train leaders in the field of treatment adherence and self-management research. This is the focus
of this T32 program. Thus far, we have trained 22 fellows (18 graduates, 4 current trainees) who are
developing promising independent research careers in pediatric adherence and self-management.
 Specific training innovations involve the integration of biomedical, behavioral, biostatistics, and health
services/outcomes research and are reflected in a comprehensive training curriculum including experiential
research opportunities. Research innovations include novel methods of adherence assessment and
intervention involving technology designed to enhance the engagement of children and adolescents, improve
the power and duration of intervention effects, and reach diverse populations who cannot easily access
traditional clinic-based approaches. Program innovation is also enhanced by novel research training
opportunities to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of adherence promotion interventions in pediatric
chronic illness management, to integrate objective methods of adherence measurement (e.g., behavioral,
pharmacological, technological) and conduct advanced statistical analyses to evaluate the impact of
adherence promotion interventions on children’s health outcomes."

Chemical Synthesis of Complex Natural Products for Translational Science
The goals of the continuing MIRA (R35GM118173) research program are to continue focus on chemical
syntheses of bioactive molecules for translational studies. The MIRA effort will allow flexibility and stability to
enable new research directions that come up during the course of research. The first four years of the R35
program have been highly productive and have led to 30 publications in high impact journals. This includes 17
collaborative manuscripts with clinical and biological investigators. As part of our studies, we have taken
opportunities to address key questions and contemporary needs in organic chemistry including asymmetric
catalysis of photocycloadditions, biomimetic cascade reactions and cycloadditions, and chemoenzymatic
synthesis. Key accomplishments in the past four years include synthesis of amidino rocaglates (ADRs) as
highly potent translation inhibitors, synthesis of meroterpenoids using reactive enetriones, biomimetic synthesis
of meroterpenoids by dearomatization-driven polycyclization, and computational investigation of chiral ion-pairs
using parallel tempering (PT) computation. As part of the MIRA renewal project, the Principal Investigator
Professor John Porco and colleagues will continue development of novel synthetic methodologies for concise
entry to bioactive classes of natural products including rocaglates, oxaphenalenones, meroterpenoids, spiro-
PPAPs, polycyclic xanthones and tetrahydroxanthones, xanthone dimers, trichothecenes, and
pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids. The project will continue major emphasis on collaborations to study biological
properties and mode of action (MoA) of target molecules for use as pharmacological therapies for human
cancers as well as viral, fungal, and bacterial illnesses. It is anticipated that the MIRA program will allow us to
continue development of innovative syntheses of complex natural products and derivatives and work to
aggressively interface these studies with applications in clinical and translational research."
10814779,"Abstract
 After years of infection, a small subset of people with HIV can develop broadly neutralizing antibodies
(bnAbs), defined as antibodies that neutralize a diverse range of HIV isolates. While eliciting bnAbs is a central
focus of HIV-1 vaccine research, bnAbs may have additional roles as long-acting biologic antiretroviral therapy
or as an immune effector arm in virus eradication studies.
 Broadly neutralizing antibodies target the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, heterotrimers of surface gp120
and transmembrane gp41 molecules, that are 50% glycan by mass. The cloning of antibody genes from
individuals with HIV identified new bnAbs with increasing potency and breadth of neutralization that have been
studied clinically as HIV-1 treatment. Whereas single infusions of bnAbs can reduce plasma virus loads in people
with HIV, virus variants resistant to the individual bnAb emerge quickly and limit the activity and therapeutic
potential of bnAb monotherapy.
 Classically, an antibody molecule contains an Fc region linked to two Fab regions with identical antigen
binding sites. Recently, an antibody was engineered that combined three distinct Fab regions into a single
molecule. SAR441236 is a tri-specific bnAb that combines the CD4bs specificity of VRC01-LS, the V1/V2
glycan-directed binding of PGDM1400, and the gp41 MPER binding of 10E8v4 into one antibody molecule.
ACTG A5377 is a phase I first-in-human study of SAR441236 that investigates the safety, pharmacokinetics
(PK), and anti-HIV-1 activity of this novel trispecific bnAb. A maximum of thirty viremic participants will be
studied in a single infusion dose de-escalation trial design with 24 weeks of follow-up.
 The goal of this proposal is to leverage samples from A5377 to determine if HIV-1 decay in response to
“triple” biologic ART differs from conventional combination ART and to define the mechanisms of virus escape
from a trispecific bnAb. The purpose of this proposal is to combine innovative experimental and mathematical
approaches with classic molecular virology to characterize the decay of viremia and define the mechanisms of
HIV-1 escape from this first-in-class trispecific bnAb. We hypothesize that the trispecific bnAb, SAR441236,
clears cell-free and cell-associated virus from blood, induces large and dynamic population shifts in the HIV-1

the presence of bnAb. Specific Aims of this proposal are to determine the kinetics of SAR441236-induced HIV-
1 decay, understand the effects of SAR441236 on HIV-1 env quasispecies, and define the HIV-1 env and
glycan shield determinants of SAR441236 resistance. Our approaches test hypotheses that are central to
understand the dynamics and evolution of HIV-1 under a trispecific bnAb selection pressure."
10756144,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cisplatin is one of the most effective and widely used anti-cancer drugs. For small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the
current platinum-based standard treatment has not changed for more than three decades. Robust initial clinical
response is usually observed in SCLC patients but the majority of patients succumb to chemoresistant
recurrence. Despite tremendous efforts have been made to understand how SCLC cells develop cisplatin
resistance, the precise mechanism remains elusive.
 As a part of our larger effort to decipher the mechanism of chemo-resistance, we employed a kinome wide
shRNA screening and identified microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase 1 (MAST1) as a “synthetic
lethal” partner of cisplatin in SCLC. Using both SCLC cell lines and patient-derived tumors (PDX), we have
demonstrated that MAST1 knockdown sensitizes ASCL1-high SCLC cells to cisplatin treatment in vitro and in
vivo. Mining of CCLE database further shows that MAST1 expression is elevated in ASCL1-high subtype SCLC
and positively correlates with cisplatin resistance in ASCL1-high SCLC cell lines. Through transcription factor
profiling and unbiased datamining, we discovered that cisplatin physically binds and stabilize NFIB protein, a
SCLC driver associated with disease progression, to promote MAST1 expression. Indeed, knockdown of NFIB
blocked MAST1 induction by cisplatin, suggesting that MAST1 may be a downstream target of NFIB in SCLC.
In addition, to identify the potential downstream effectors of MAST1 that contributes to cisplatin resistance in
SCLC, we performed mass spectrometry-based proteomic studies and identified PLK1 as a potential binding
partner of MAST1. In vitro kinase assay demonstrated that MAST1 directly phosphorylates PLK1 activation site
T210. These findings identified MAST1 as a promising target to overcome cisplatin resistance in SCLC.
However, no small molecule drug targeting MAST1 is currently available. Thus, we employed a “drug
repurposing” strategy and identified clinical trial-staged kinase inhibitor lestaurtinib as a novel MAST1 inhibitor.
Lestaurtinib significantly restored cisplatin sensitivity in SCLC cell lines and PDX models with minimal toxicity.
 Our central hypothesis is that cisplatin stabilizes NFIB protein to promote MAST1-PLK1 signaling, leading to
cisplatin resistance in SCLC. Thus, targeting MAST1-PLK1 signaling represents a promising anti-SCLC target
in combination with cisplatin, particularly for ASCL1-high subtype SCLC. We will test our hypothesis through the
following aims: (1) To determine whether and how cisplatin stabilizes NFIB to promote MAST1 expression and
consequently lead to cisplatin resistance in SCLC. (2) To determine whether MAST1 confers cisplatin resistance
to SCLC by activating PLK1 and promoting cell cycle progression in the presence of cisplatin. (3) To validate
NFIB-MAST1-PLK1 axis as a therapeutic target for cisplatin-resistant SCLC."
10816998,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) is a neural progenitor domain located in the ventral
telencephalon. It is well-studied for its production of cortical interneurons, a broadly distributed population of locally-pro-
jecting neurons that regulate cortical rhythmicity. The MGE also produces projection neurons that remain in the ventral
forebrain, arranged in discrete nuclei that project distally point-to-point. Interneuron and projection neuron identity represent
two fundamentally-distinct populations, with distinct functions. How the MGE delineates between the production of IN and
PN, however, is not understood.
 We have identified a transcription factor, St18 that appears to regulate this fundamental delineation. We previously
described a model system to study MGE development using induced expression of candidate factors. When St18 was intro-
duced in this system, the cells largely adopted a projection neuron identity. Further, when these cells were transplanted in
utero, they remained in the ventral forebrain and adopted long-range axonal projections reminiscent of globus pallidus pars
externa (GPe). Moreover, in our initial analysis of the St18 conditional loss-of-function mutant mouse, we observed a spe-
cific loss of GPe neurons, while all other MGE lineages appear spared.
 In this proposal, we will; Aim 1) Determine whether St18 induced expression is sufficient to direct MGE progenitors
towards projection neuron identity (Techniques: ESC directed differentiation, neuronal culture, in vitro migration assays,
UBM transplantation, RNA-seq). Aim 2) Test whether St18 is necessary for MGE projection neuron fate by analysis of
St18 conditional loss-of-function mouse (Techniques: mouse genetics, viral and dye tracing of axon projections, scRNA-
seq). Aim 3) Manipulate St18 during MGE progenitor differentiation to probe the time window of its action and test how it
regulates gene expression in directing projection neuron identity (Techniques: ESC directed differentiation, in vitro mor-
phology and migration assays, ChIP-seq). Importantly, in the course of our study, we will perform a multi-level expression
and ChIP-seq analysis to uncover the gene networks and cellular pathways under the regulation of St18 that collectively
govern aspects of projection neuron identity: neuronal migration, polarity, process morphogenesis. In summary, we are
uniquely positioned to address how MGE progenitors regulate projection neuron versus interneuron identity in the MGE
lineage. Through these efforts, we aim to inform more broadly as to how projection and interneuron identity is assigned
throughout the nervous system."
10811785,"This application is in response to PAS-18-915 HIV/AIDS High Priority Drug Abuse Research. HIV incidence
among Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) in the southeastern United States is one of the highest in
the world. Our research team has conducted studies with BMSM in Atlanta that have demonstrated 35% HIV
prevalence and over 5% annual HIV incidence. Although PrEP is highly effective for preventing HIV
transmission, it is not reaching BMSM. The failures in our ability to engage BMSM in PrEP use are highly
problematic given the alarming rates of HIV transmission among this group. In our most recent work with
BMSM in Atlanta, we found that only 4% (n=19/474) of BMSM are currently taking PrEP even though
90% (n=428/474) are aware of PrEP. Of particular concern is the impact of substance use as a barrier in
PrEP linkage, uptake, adherence, and persistence. Substance use is common among BMSM in our study, with
43% (n=204/474) reporting recent substance use. And, critically, in our most recent longitudinal study
with BMSM, substance users were more than twice as likely than non-substance users to test HIV
positive, 7% (n=15/205) vs. 2% (n=4/244) at baseline testing, and an additional 7% (n=13/190) vs 3%
(n=8/240) at study follow up one year later. Further complicating PrEP use is the potential impact of COVID-
19 on health care access, health care infrastructure, and sex behavior. The need to better understand PrEP
use in the context of our new health care landscape is critical to making advances in PrEP use. At this point,
assessing how substance use impacts PrEP use is challenging because PrEP implementation is so low among
this group. The proposed research aims to provide substance using BMSM with evidence-based PrEP
engagement counseling to address barriers to accessing PrEP (not for intervention testing, but for
facilitating PrEP use) and to assess the multiple forms and paths of stigma and substance use as they
relate to PrEP linkage, uptake, adherence, and persistence. We propose using the HIV Stigma Framework
as a conceptual model for investigating the intersecting pathways of stigma drivers and stigma
mechanisms as they relate to PrEP use among substance using BMSM. Aim 1: Enroll a prospective cohort
of N=500 BMSM who test HIV negative and test substance use positive on toxicology testing, and provide
evidence-based PrEP engagement counseling to facilitate access to PrEP care. Aim 2: Conduct psychosocial
and health care access assessments every 2-months for 18-months, and conduct HIV/STI testing and dried
blood spot testing for TFV-DP every 3-months for 18-months. Aim 3: Using data collected from Aims 1 and 2,
model stigma pathways of advancing and reverting along the PrEP cascade (i.e., linkage, uptake, adherence,
persistence), with these pathways mediated by health care access and moderated by substance use.
Achieving the aims will provide critical insight for translating and adapting interventions to enhance potency
and durability for individuals at exceedingly elevated risk for HIV."

The goal of the Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) at the Holden Comprehensive Cancer
Center (HCCC) is to ensure the highest scientific quality of clinical oncology research is conducted at
the HCCC. A two-step review process is used. Trial concepts are first reviewed by the disease-specific
Multidisciplinary Oncology Groups (MOGs) to determine enthusiasm for the proposed science, potential
impact of the results and whether the resources and patient population are adequate to complete the
proposed studies. The Trial Resource Evaluation Committee (TREC) provides input into whether the
institutional resources are available to support the trial. Once a protocol is approved by the MOG and
has TREC endorsement, it is fully developed and reviewed by the Protocol Review and Monitoring
Committee (PRMC). The PRMC approves, rejects or defers the protocol for further development.
Studies which have already undergone rigorous peer review including NCI-approved NCTN studies and
studies approved by other NCI-designated cancer centers with an acceptable PRMS, are reviewed
administratively by the PRMC Chair. PRMC approval is required before IRB review. The PRMC also
monitors accrual to ongoing clinical trials. The PRMC closes protocols that do not demonstrate
scientific progress or that are no longer addressing a scientifically valid question."
10843917,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in humans. Despite intense research there is
as yet no cure for AD and the increasing incidence of AD in developed countries poses a tremendous cost to
society as lifespans increase. There are two forms of AD, those that have genetic determinants and comprise
approximately 5% of cases, and those that arise sporadically, particularly upon aging, and comprise the vast
majority (~95%) of new AD cases diagnosed. The underlying triggers for sporadic AD are diverse and not well
understood. Current therapeutic strategies are limited to those that attenuate AD symptomology without affecting
the progression of the disease itself. Thus understanding the etiology of the disease is necessary to generate
better therapeutics. A widely accepted hypothesis, known as the ‘mitochondrial cascade hypothesis’, posits that
aging leads to accumulation of damaged mitochondria that produce mitochondrial reactive oxygen species
(mROS), triggering progressive oxidative damage that ultimately results in development of AD. However, despite
decades of study, definitive evidence for mROS or aberrant accumulation of damaged mitochondria as a key
trigger have not emerged. Our preliminary studies establish a critical role for the mitochondrial complex I
assembly factor ECSIT in the regulation of mitochondrial function, mROS production, and mitochondrial quality
control. Moreover, we have obtained evidence implicating dysregulation of ECSIT expression/function in AD.
Therefore, we propose a series of experiments that leverage the unique expertise of the two principal
investigators, and institutional capabilities, to fully characterize the role of ECSIT in neurodegeneration and AD.
The proposed experiments will allow us to directly test the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis in murine models
of AD and also probe the relationship between ECSIT dysregulation and the development of AD."
10852851,"Disruption of the cortico-striatal network has been found in many human brain disorders, including Parkinson’s
disease, Huntington’s disease, autism, schizophrenia, and major depression. Unfortunately, the cellular and
molecular deficits responsible for the development of disrupted connectivity in these disorders are very difficult
to study because of the limited access to primary human brain tissue and inability to recapitulate disease-related
network deficits in animal models. This is a major problem that prevents the discovery of novel therapies for
patients. Thus, the objectives of this study are to develop the first robust method for generating human cortico-
striatal organoids that recapitulate cortico-striatal connectivity and to use this system to investigate the cellular
and molecular mechanisms responsible for the establishment and maturation of human cortico-striatal networks.
To this end, we will use our new method to generate cortical and, for the first time, striatal organoids from human
stem cell-derived single neural rosettes (SNRs). In our preliminary experiments, we found that SNR-derived
cortical organoids consist of different subtypes of pallial neural progenitors, deep and superficial layer cortical
excitatory neurons, a small fraction of inhibitory neurons with lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE)-like identities,
astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, whereas SNR-derived striatal organoids are composed of different subtypes
of subpallial neural progenitors, D1/D2 medium spiny neurons, a large fraction of inhibitory neurons with LGE-
like identities, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. In addition, we demonstrated that neurons in 5-month-old SNR-
derived organoids show functional and morphological evidence of maturity—firing repetitive action potentials,
receiving excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, and exhibiting elaborate dendritic branches and spines. Our
specific aims in this study are (1) to develop a robust and reproducible protocol for assembling cortico-striatal
organoids with well-defined cell composition and organization; (2) to characterize the establishment of
anatomical and functional networks in human cortico-striatal organoids; and (3) to determine the molecular and
functional properties of the cortical and striatal neurons that make the connections. Importantly, we will use
“cutting-edge” techniques such as single-cell mRNA sequencing, chronically implanted multi-electrode probes,
rabies virus tracing, and optogenetics to investigate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. In
summary, this project will develop the first protocol for assembling functional human cortico-striatal networks and
provide novel insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of network connectivity. As most brain
disorders impact several brain regions and disrupt interregional brain communication, the ability to generate
organoids representing multiple brain regions that replicate the complex nervous system architecture and
physiology will constitute a major breakthrough in brain disease modeling and drug discovery."

We propose to continue and improve the NIA training program on “Population, Life Course and Aging” located
in the Center for Demography of Health and Aging (CDHA) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW). The
training program builds on the resources of CDHA to form a long-standing, highly-visible core of research and
training in population aging and health at UW. The program draws from a large pool of talented and highly
qualified students in the social sciences and public health, and benefits from the rich interdisciplinary
environment that integrates research and teaching across the departments of Sociology, Economics, and
Population Health Sciences, as well as the La Follette School of Public Affairs, Alzheimer’s Disease Research
Center, the Institute on Aging, the Center for Demography and Ecology, and other centers and programs at
UW. The goal of the CDHA training program is to recruit, develop, support and place productive and
innovative researchers with expertise in demographic methods and statistical analysis who approach the study
of aging from a life course perspective. The current emphases of the program reflect the research strengths of
our faculty: biodemography; the lifetime determinants of cognitive health; and the role of social, economic,
geographic, environmental, and institutional factors in shaping health and health disparities in later life. The
training program also capitalizes on several locally-designed large-scale surveys that combine innovative
biological and social measurements and provide opportunities for training at multiple forefronts of research on
population, aging, and health across the life course. Our program cultivates trainees’ professional skills,
including the conceptualization, execution, presentation, publication, and critique of research via a (1) rigorous
methodological and substantive coursework, (2) research apprenticeships that allow trainees to begin
collaborative research and publication from the start of the program; (3) specialized interdisciplinary research
working groups; (4) professional development seminars ongoing support for developing individual research
agendas, presenting at conferences, publishing papers, and developing grant proposals; (5) close mentoring
relationships between trainees and preceptors; and (6) access to local and national workshops and
professional meetings. We request support for 4 predoctoral trainees (who will generally be supported for 3
years) and 1 postdoctoral trainee (who will generally be supported for 2 years), a level equal to our current
number of positions. This support is essential for sustaining a critical mass of trainees and training-related
research activity. Our students have an excellent record and graduates embark on careers that contribute
substantially to research, education, and public service in the areas of population aging and health."
10885917,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Estrogen withdrawal at menopause is associated with a suite of metabolic, vascular, and neuroendocrine
changes that impact health and quality of life. The most specific symptoms associated with menopause are
vasomotor symptoms, which include hot flashes and night sweats. It is thought that vasomotor symptoms are
caused by fluctuating estrogen levels at the time of the menopausal transition. However, it is unclear how
these changes affect temperature regulation in the brain. Our preliminary data identify a thermoregulatory role
for neurons that express estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in the medial preoptic area (MPO) of the
hypothalamus, a potent temperature sensor and regulator. We hypothesize that ERalpha signaling in the MPO
modulates the activity of thermoregulatory neural circuits. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following
specific aims: 1) Define the thermoregulatory role of ERalpha+ neurons and ERalpha signaling in the MPO, 2) Dissect
the neural circuitry that mediates estrogen-induced changes in heat dissipation and generation, and 3)
determine the transcriptional effects of estrogen signaling in thermoregulatory ERalpha+ neurons. Together these
studies will dissect the effects of estrogens on temperature regulation at the level of circuits, neurons, and
gene expression. This mechanistic approach is essential for understanding how estrogens alter body
temperature and is a necessary first step toward identifying new non-hormonal therapies for hot flashes and
other vasomotor symptoms."
10827466,"PROJECT SUMMARY
All complex eukaryotes rely on mitochondria to generate the cellular energy needed to maintain proper
organismal function. Mutations in the mitochondrial genome underly multiple diseases and have been
suggested to play a general role in aging. However, understanding the causes and consequences of
mitochondrial mutations is limited by a focus on mammalian models. We will characterize mitochondrial
mutations and their effects on physiology in diverse eukaryotic systems, including invertebrates, plants, and
micro-eukaryotes. We will address three challenges that have hindered our understanding of mitochondrial
mutations. First, we will use high-fidelity sequencing to characterize rates and types of mitochondrial
mutations across eukaryotes and under different environments (e.g., increased oxidative stress), resulting in a
“mitochondrial mutation atlas”. Of particular interest is the frequency of C -> T transitions resulting from
replication errors vs. G -> T transversions characteristic of oxidative damage. The latter are implicated in aging
theories, but the former have been shown to dominate the mutational landscape in mammalian mitochondrial
genomes. Second, we will quantify distinct states of oxidative phosphorylation, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production, and metabolic rate in systems with varying sources and rates of mitochondrial mutations to
determine how mutations affect organelle and organismal traits. We will also explore a mechanistic link
between oxidative stress and mitochondrial mutations by increasing ROS via superoxide dismutase
knockdown. Third, we will examine mitonuclear protein and transcript balance in two lineages where closely
related organisms have disparate lifespans: rockfishes and cave salamanders. A shift towards reduced
mitochondrial protein abundances has been identified as a conserved mechanism of longevity in long-lived
strains of mice and nematodes, but it is unknown if natural long-lived populations have altered mitonuclear
protein balance. We will also quantify mitochondrial mutations and physiology in these species to determine
how natural selection may have shaped aging through mitochondrial processes. Overall, this research will
provide a complement to previous work on mammalian models, which show uniformly high mitochondrial
mutation rates. It will further uncover the possibilities for mitochondrial mutations to influence cellular and
organismal processes, with implications for human health, disease progression, and aging."

This application requests continued support for the “Vanderbilt Infection Pathogenesis and Epidemiology
Research” (VIPER) Training Program. The objective is to prepare postdoctoral fellows for careers in
infectious diseases basic science, translational research, and epidemiology in infectious diseases.
Training is in basic laboratory research to study disease pathogenesis using molecular and cellular
methods, translational science, and patient-oriented epidemiology and outcomes research. Our field has
a critical labor force shortage in physician-scientists in these interrelated areas that this T32 addresses.
There is broad expertise among our program faculty covering immunology and inflammation, virology
(HIV and Other Viruses), bacteriology, personalized medicine, vaccines, clinical trials, and epidemiology
and outcomes research (HIV, TB, hospital epidemiology, and global health). VIPER brings early-stage,
emerging investigators together, rather than training them in silos or vacuum, enhancing the potential for
basic scientists to appreciate and understand “real world” problems and barriers to implementation that
might inform their own experimental designs, hypotheses, and long-term goals. Similarly, we help
empower translational scientists to better appreciate both clinical (“bedside”) needs, revealed by
epidemiological research, and candidate, bench-based solutions, which they can then couple through
translational research to advance human health. Enhancing interactions among these three
“phenotypes” of investigators we also position epidemiologists to collect and analyze data that are most
informative to their translational and basic science colleagues. Almost every “intractable” problem in
infectious diseases will benefit from this holistic approach, which our T32 is aiming to foster. We will
catalyze team science and collaborative problem solving through integrated conferences, networking
events, shared classes/coursework, and regular, seemingly stochastic, interactions. Participating faculty
are in the Infectious Disease Divisions of Medicine and Pediatrics, the Division of Epidemiology, and the
Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology. This program has a strong track record of
interactive training of post-MD fellows from both Medicine and Pediatrics, and also includes post-PhD
trainees. There is extensive collaboration among mentors. Long-term success is maximized by a
customized research career plan for each trainee with a dedicated mentor, and under the supervision of
an expert advisory committee and the Program Directors. VIPER provides support for Masters of
Science in Clinical Investigation and Masters in Public Health Degrees. Vanderbilt courses in responsible
conduct of research, unconscious bias and sexual harassment are required. Physicians complete a year
of clinical training before starting VIPER training, and a minimum of two years of research training is
required for all fellows."

Identifying molecular drivers of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) pathologies is an
urgent public health priority. This is especially important in persons of African Ancestry. The overall goal of
the proposed study is to identify genes and proteins that drive common AD/ADRD pathologic traits.
We previously used multi-level omics to identify molecular drivers of AD/ADRD pathologic traits in non-Latinx

unique, ongoing, diverse study being conducted in Sao Paulo, Brazil, called “Pathology, Alzheimer´s and
Related Dementias Study” (PARDoS) and five other diverse cohorts in the USA, with whole genome
sequencing (WGS) on more than 1350 diverse autopsied participants. PARDoS is prospectively generating
neuropathologic and clinical AD/ADRD traits, and DNA on admixed Brazilians of European and African, and to
a lesser extent Native Brazilian ancestry. The proposal has the following Aims.
Aim 1 will generate WGS on an additional 7650 persons in collaboration with the Alzheimer’s Disease
Sequencing Project (ADSP). Aim 2 will perform deep admixture mapping of known SNPs for Alzheimer’s
dementia, to determine their associations with AD/ADRD neuropathologic phenotypes in 6500 admixed
Brazilian brains followed generalization to 300 diverse brains from the USA, and discovery analyses for 5500
Brazilians followed by generalization to 2000 diverse samples in the USA. Aim 3 will computationally determine
telomere length (TL) and examine their association with AD/ADRD clinical and pathologic traits. An exploratory
analysis will examine for rare variant associations with AD/ADRD neuropathologic traits.
Aim 5 will examine the
association of mitochondrial DNA to AD/ADRD traits."
10796909,"The huge loss of life and major damage to the social fabric that is caused by a viral pandemic has been brought
graphically to light with the current SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) crisis. Clearly, broad-spectrum antiviral agents that
are effective therapeutically and prophylactically against SARS-CoV-2, anticipate other epidemic coronaviruses
that emerge from animal reservoirs, and can be administered easily at home or in the outpatient clinic are much
needed. Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been remarkably effective, but waning immunity, viral evolution,
distribution issues, and social resistance to vaccines have slowed progress. We have created a promising
new broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus agent through molecular engineering of a high mannose-binding
lectin from bananas, BanLec. The resulting lectin, termed H84T-BanLec (H84T), is the first in which two
functions of a lectin have been separated by targeted engineering, leading to loss of mitogenicity (unwanted
immune activation) and retention of broad-spectrum antiviral activity; H84T binds to the high mannose on viral
envelopes and blocks attachment and fusion to the host cell. We have demonstrated the efficacy of H84T against
influenza A and B, HIV, hepatitis C, and Ebola. In mouse (immunocompetent, immunodeficient, and with a
humanized immune system), rat, and hamster studies, H84T is well-tolerated. (The selectivity for viruses is
based on the fact that high mannose (as opposed to simple mannose) is not present on most healthy animal
cells). We have now shown that H84T is effective in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 (including the Omicron
variant), SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and all other coronaviruses tested (all have high mannose on their
surface spike protein). H84T is also effective in vivo against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the latter
whether H84T is delivered systemically or intranasally or as prophylaxis or as therapy. Atomic force
microscopy and other modalities reveal that H84T creates multiple, independent, tight bonds with high mannose
residues on the spike protein, in keeping with the strong and broad-spectrum antiviral activity. We now propose
to further study the mechanism of action and activity of H84T against SARS-CoV-2 variants and coronaviruses
from animal reservoirs with pandemic potential. To yet further enhance the potency of H84T and improve large-
scale production, we will create and test both molecularly-evolved H84T and H84T-antibody hybrid molecules
(“lectibodies”). As the use of H84T as an intranasal agent is likely to be the route by which we can reach many
more people, we will optimize formulations for the safe and sustained intranasal release of the molecule. We will
further test the therapeutic and prophylactic activity of H84T and derivatives against SARS-CoV-2 variants and
emerging coronaviruses in animal models. The development of H84T as an intranasal anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug
and pan-coronavirus agent will allow us to provide treatment and/or prophylaxis in coronavirus (and influenza)
epidemics using an agent easily administered in the outpatient clinic and even at home so it can reach large
numbers of people."
10759400,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects over 1.2 million patients in the United States and causes significant
morbidity and healthcare expenditures. Studies have associated the development of IBD with changes in the
human gut microbiome, which together with genetic and environmental factors alter immune responses to gut
flora and cause chronic inflammation. The surface and secreted proteins and glycans of gut microbes mediates
many aspects of these immune interactions. However, the study of these molecules is limited by the extreme
complexity of the gut environment. Standard proteomic techniques only capture a small fraction of the predicted
microbial gene products while metagenomic analyses using automated annotations fail to identify functions for
nearly half of all predicted proteins. The dietary, host, and microbial contributions to the diverse carbohydrate
pool also makes the analysis of microbial glycans in stool samples highly challenging. The incomplete evaluation
of microbial surface and secreted proteins and microbial glycans impedes the discovery of new biological insights
into IBD. Machine learning algorithms, and especially advancements in natural language processing (NLP)
based on deep neural networks, have enabled major improvements in the accuracy of a number of tasks related
to human speech and written text. These deep neural networks function by analyzing massive collections of texts
and then creating high-dimensional vectors to represent the semantic meaning of words without the need for
specific labels. Biological polymers such as DNA, proteins, and glycans are also long complex sequences, and
application of NLP techniques enabled accurate predictions of the functional and structural characteristics of
proteins and glycans from primary sequence. We hypothesize that machine learning methods incorporating deep
neural networks can be successfully applied to the analysis of microbial metagenomes and glycomes to identify
previously unknown perturbations in IBD. We will test this hypothesis with the following aims: 1) Develop and
adapt deep learning algorithms to analyze the surface-associated and secreted gut microbial metaproteome in
IBD; 2) Create and apply deep learning algorithms to analyze the fecal microbial glycome in IBD; 3)
Experimentally validate the functions of a subset of novel microbial proteins and glycans that are altered in IBD.

treatment of IBD. This proposal comprises a five-year research career development program focused on the
creation and adaptation of deep learning algorithms to the analysis of gut microbial metagenomic and glycomic

with a unique set of skills that will enable him to transition to independence as a physician-scientist."
10763423,"Project Summary
Cardiotoxicities associated with small molecule cancer therapeutics are well documented. However,
emerging reports of adverse cardiac reactions due to monoclonal antibody-based immune checkpoint
inhibitors (ICIs) is a growing concern. These ICIs act on programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor or
its ligand programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) enhancing antitumor response, and these often lead to
such immune-related adverse events (iRAEs). Several studies point toward the homology between tumor
antigens and cardiac proteins as one of the reasons for outcomes such as myocarditis, changes in cardiac
rhythm, and vasculitis.
 Due to the rare, early detection iRAEs and scarcity of patient samples. The mechanism of ICI-induced
cardiac disease remains elusive. Hence, utilizing a unique multi-disciplinary approach and expertise in
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, immunology and bioengineering strategies, I hypothesize
that, iPSC-derived 3-D cardiac organoids (COs) with immune cells can be used to model ICI-induced cardiac
injury. Unraveling the disease mechanism of cardiac injury due to ICI treatment using a reductionist approach
may lead to discovery of new targets that can confer cardioprotection for immunotherapies. In order to
accomplish this goal, I have defined three specific aims: (1) I will generate COs through self-assembly of
iPSC-cardiomyocytes, iPSC-endothelial cells and iPSC-cardiac fibroblasts and test two commonly used ICIs
Pembrolizumab (PD-1 inhibitor) and Atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitor). I will for assess for changes in CO
function in the presence and absence of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) used for iPSCs
derivation (2) I will conduct in-depth molecular analyses of the COs at a single cell level and identify potential
targets responsible to hyper immune response can cardiac dysfunction (3) Finally, I will use cutting-edge
genome editing techniques to knockdown the gene targets that help rescue the CO function after ICI
treatment. The targets identified in Aim 2 will be validated again in mouse models by injecting ICIs into mice
with diverse immune backgrounds followed by evaluation of heart function and molecular changes within the
tissue.
 In this multidisciplinary project, with the support from my esteemed panel of mentors, advisors and
collaborators, I am confident that I will receive par excellence training to accomplish both scientific and career
development goals. Given my scientific track record to date, and complementary training sought through this
K99/R00 award, together will help me develop and lead several research areas building toward a successful
independent career."
10911002,"Robert Stansbury, M.D., is a fourth generation West Virginian and pulmonologist whose overarching career goal
is to improve healthcare disparities for chronic respiratory illness in rural communities. This K23 mentored career
development award, entitled “A Novel OSA Training Intervention to Improve Provider Management of Sleep
Apnea in Rural Communities”, builds upon my previous training to ensure a successful transition into being an
independent investigator. My research career goals include: 1) obtain training in mixed-methods research to
investigate facilitators and barriers to care for respiratory disease in rural areas, 2) receive training in
implementation science using community engaged research and ultimately conduct clinical trials to improve
respiratory disease outcomes, and 3) enhance management skills for developing and leading an independent
research program. I am a non-traditional candidate and have made significant contributions as a faculty member
at West Virginia University (WVU). My recent administrative work as interim Chief for the Division of Pulmonary,
Critical Care and Sleep Medicine at WVU has led to a pivot from research in respiratory physiology to healthcare
disparities. I have completed recent studies in this area; however, this research has been completed with
extensive mentorship and support. This career development award is an ideal mechanism for me to successfully
transition to lead my own independent research program in respiratory health disparities. With my primary
mentor, Dr. Pat Strollo, I have assembled a strong team of co-mentors and consultants who will guide me through
the proposed career development and research training plans. Clinical, didactic, and research collaboration with
these mentors and consultants forms the foundation of these career development activities and will facilitate a
multidisciplinary team approach. This team has expertise in obstructive sleep apnea, education, academic career
development, clinical and translational science and rural health/healthcare disparities. The career development
training plan utilizes intellectual resources and the research infrastructure available at WVU, West Virginia
Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (WVCTSI), and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)
where I have an adjunct faculty appointment. I will attend national conferences and pursue further training outside
of WVU when optimal training is not available locally. The WVU is an ideal location to study health care disparities
in rural communities due to the long-standing challenges of this rural state. The university has a world-class
research infrastructure, an extensive network of hospitals and clinics, and a large tertiary care university hospital
which serves a predominant rural population. This K23 award will enable my successful transition to being an
independent physician-investigator with a research program addressing the healthcare disparities of respiratory
illnesses found in rural communities."

 The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine whether rapid response-style, personalized
recommendations for the workup and treatment of patients with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), as delivered by a
remote Kidney Action Team, will improve clinical outcomes in a hospitalized population. AKI is a common
complication in hospitalized patients and is associated with dramatic increases in the risk of inpatient mortality,
long-term chronic kidney disease, and cost. International guidelines for AKI treatment focus on best practices
that include appropriate management of drug dosing, avoidance of kidney-toxic exposures, and careful
hemodynamic and electrolyte balance. However, multiple studies and our preliminary data suggest that AKI is
often missed in a variety of hospital settings and that diagnostic and therapeutic actions are infrequently taken
or inappropriate. Failure to engage in best practices is associated with increased morbidity and mortality
among AKI patients.
 Our group focuses extensively on increasing provider awareness and recognition of AKI. Our
randomized trials of simple electronic AKI alert systems have demonstrated clinical equipoise regarding the
effectiveness of such alerting, as there was no improvement in clinical outcomes among those in the alert
group. However, the alert was purely informational and provided no actionable recommendations. Because of
the heterogeneity of both the AKI patient and AKI etiology, diagnostic and treatment plans should be highly
individualized and consider many facets of care, including diagnostic workup, acid/base management,
electrolyte management, hemodynamic management, and medication management.
 This proposal seeks to build on our prior experience to determine whether offering providers prompt
and actionable items that are personalized to individual patients may be more beneficial in the care of AKI
patients. Across two medical centers and eight hospitals, we will recruit and train Kidney Action Teams –
acting as a rapid response team for AKI – consisting of an advanced practitioner, a pharmacist and a
nephrologist. In a hub-and-spoke design, centralized Kidney Action Teams will make personalized
recommendations on AKI diagnosis and treatment based on electronic chart review. Kidney Action Team
recommendations will be created for all patients but delivered only in those randomized to the intervention.
This experimental design will determine: 1) whether real-time personalized recommendations for AKI diagnosis
and treatment improve improve patient outcomes; 2) which patients and providers are most likely to benefit
from e-consults of this type and 3) whether a fully automated rules engine can successfully mimic human-
derived recommendations. Such an automated system, if successful, would provide a highly generalizable
model for integration into other health systems."
10832024,"Directed evolution mimics and accelerates natural evolution in the laboratory in order to create useful
new biomolecules and to study evolutionary processes. Although methodologies for directed evolution are well-
established in test tubes and in simple organisms like E. coli and yeast, there is still a major challenge. Specifi-
cally, novel biomolecules derived from directed evolution campaigns in these platforms often fail to function
when transferred to more complex cellular environments, such as that of human cells. To address this critical
issue, our laboratory recently pioneered a directed evolution platform that can be used to repeatedly generate
massive libraries of mutant biomolecules while continuously selecting and enriching the most functional vari-
ants directly in the human cell environment. From a chemical biology perspective, we are also deeply engaged
in studying functions of the proteostasis network – a vital and unique aspect of the human cellular environment
that ensures proteins are correctly folded, processed and trafficked. We have developed an array of chemical
genetic tools to modulate proteostasis, and we are now primed to integrate these tools with our directed evolu-
tion platform to both evolve previously inaccessible biomolecule functions and gain a deeper understanding of
how cells solve protein folding problems.
 Altogether, this NIGMS MIRA application seeks to combine two of my laboratory's primary interests: (1)
Developing and applying next-generation, human cell-based directed evolution platforms to generate biomole-
cules optimized for function in complex cells and (2) Integrating evolution with chemical modulation of proteo-
stasis to gain new insights into fundamental principles of proteostasis network function. Here, we propose to
integrate these research areas to deliver an array of biomolecules that reliably and robustly perform valuable
new functions in the complex human cellular milieu. Examples include G-protein coupled receptors controlled
by synthetic regulators for neuroscience applications, systems for incorporation of unnatural amino acids in
proteins, and inhibitors of important signaling pathways related to disease. All of these targets have proven ex-
ceedingly difficult to reliably evolve in lower organisms or test tubes. Beyond these practical advances, we will
also integrate human cell-based directed evolution with proteostasis modulation to gain insights into how the
network solves protein folding problems. For example, we will use our capacity to modulate proteostasis to test
the hypothesis that chaperones can be used to “turbo-charge” directed evolution campaigns by providing ac-
cess to otherwise biophysically unacceptable regions of the mutational landscape. Further, we will pursue an
understanding of the roles of chaperones in human protein evolution, a process that is particularly important in
the setting of tumorigenesis and in the development of drug resistance in oncogenes. Altogether, our contribu-
tions will impact fields ranging from biotechnology and drug development to protein folding biophysics, evolu-
tionary biology, and cancer research."

Glioblastomas are deadly tumors and account for approximately half of all malignant primary brain cancers.
Glioblastoma stem cells exist in interchangeable cellular states that are influenced by the tumor
microenvironment, and there is a paucity of information concerning the cellular mechanisms responsible for
communicating between glioblastoma cells and the tumor stroma. The Hedgehog pathway, which directs gene
expression programs that are essential for development and adult stem cell homeostasis, is critical for survival
of glioblastoma stem cells. Paradoxically, a clinical trial suggested that pharmacologic inhibition of the Hedgehog
pathway accelerates glioblastoma growth. These clinical data provide an opportunity to re-evaluate how the
Hedgehog pathway functions in cancer, and suggest that the role of Hedgehog signaling in glioblastoma stem
cells remains to be elucidated. This proposal focuses on understanding how inhibition of the Hedgehog pathway
drives glioblastoma at the tumor, cellular, and molecular scale. To do so, our proposal incorporates a novel
astrocyte organoid model of glioblastoma that facilitates live imaging of cellular interactions within the tumor
microenvironment. When integrated with CRISPR interference, pharmacology, and mouse syngeneic and
patient derived xenograft models of glioblastoma, our innovative organoid system will facilitate previously
impossible experiments to understand glioblastoma biology. Based on our preliminary organoid, in vivo, and
single cell RNA sequencing data presented in this application, we hypothesize that cancer cell-extrinsic
Hedgehog signaling in the tumor microenvironment restrains glioblastoma stem cell-renewal and invasion by
inducing differentiation factors and remodeling the extracellular matrix. We will test this hypothesis by defining
how Hedgehog signals are transduced through the glioblastoma microenvironment; determining if cancer-cell
extrinsic Hedgehog signaling restrains glioblastoma stem cells by inducing bone morphogenic protein signaling;
and determining if Hedgehog signaling restrains glioblastoma cell invasion by inducing genes that regulate
migration through the extracellular matrix. This approached is based on the premise that by studying the
mechanisms of Hedgehog signaling in glioblastoma, we will discover new insights into how glioblastoma cells
communicate with the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, we know surprisingly little about how interactions
between glioblastoma cells and the tumor microenvironment influence cancer progression, and almost nothing
about how astrocytes, which comprise the majority of cell types in the adult brain, influence glioblastoma invasion
or tumorigenesis. Though the objective of this proposal is to broadly improve our understanding of the
mechanisms of Hedgehog signaling in glioblastoma, a long-term goal of this research is to understand these
processes well enough to consider targeted therapeutic strategies to improve survival from glioblastoma. Thus,
this work will explain why Hedgehog pathway inhibition unexpectedly accelerates glioblastoma growth, elucidate
targetable mechanisms, and provide the preclinical basis for new clinical trials in glioblastoma patients."
10815560,"Project Summary
In the midst of emerging threats from sporadic viral entities, the perennial influenza viral strains continue to
impose a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality that compounds total annual risks to the population at
large. Last season (2018-19), influenza affected 35.5 million and led to 490,600 hospitalizations and 34,200
deaths in the U.S. These vital statistics have been steadily rising each year. Individuals with cardiovascular
disease are especially susceptible to the morbidity and mortality associated community-acquired viral
infections such as influenza. Vaccination significantly reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events at the
population level; However, administration of influenza vaccination at the individual level is extremely variable
with respect to (i) the extent of humoral antibody response achieved, and (ii) the degree of cardioprotection
conferred. Intriguingly, the degree of cardioprotection conferred does not depend entirely on the level of
humoral immunity achieved, highlighting further opportunities to discover and derive clinical benefit from a
preventive therapy with both complex and non- uniform effects. Accumulating evidence now indicates that
upstream mediators of endogenous immune- inflammatory pathways are likely key determinants of the
individual-level response to and benefit from an administered vaccination. These molecular mediators of
systemic immune-inflammatory activity, termed eicosanoids, include a diverse family of small bioactive lipids
that are enzymatically derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids. Based on results from preliminary studies, we
hypothesize that specific eicosanoids not only predict the immunologic response to influenza vaccination but
also predict its conferred protection from adverse cardiovascular events, irrespective of infection status.
Therefore, we propose an ancillary study for the NHLBI-funded INfluenza Vaccine to Effectively Stop
cardioThoracic Events and Decompensated heart failure (INVESTED) trial, that aims to: (1) identify
eicosanoids that predict the classic humoral antibody response to influenza vaccination in patients with
chronic cardiovascular disease, who represent the population subset most at-risk for adverse events; and,
(2) identify eicosanoids generated in response to vaccination that correspond with reduced risk for
cardiovascular events, irrespective of humoral immunity and infection status. The existing infrastructure of
the INVESTED trial offers a cost-effective way to reach individuals who are at the highest risk for influenza-
associated events and enable a rigorous study design for investigating heterogeneity in the response to and
benefit from vaccination."
10817838,"Pain is currently the most common cause of long-term disability in the United States, affecting over 70 million
Americans and 1.5 billion people worldwide. The first line of treatment for pain has been opioids, however their
use is associated with addiction, dependence and overdose. A strategy for reducing the reliance on opioids for
treatment of chronic pain is to better understand the circuits that mediate different aspects of chronic pain and
identify non-opioidergic mechanisms to restore normal circuit function and behavior. Corticotropin releasing
factor (CRF) signaling in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) has been shown to regulate both
nociceptive and affective/motivational behaviors associated with pain, however the clinical utility of
pharmacologically targeting the CRF system has yet to be explored. Given the critical need to develop treatments
to target affective and motivational aspects of chronic pain, this could be an important path forward. We
hypothesize that persistent inflammatory pain leads to increased activation of CRF signaling in the BNST leading
to disrupted affective behaviors and reduced motivation. We posit that modulators of BNST function that oppose
CRF signaling could provide a novel approach to investigate and treat both nociceptive and motivational/affective
aspects of pain. Relevant to this, we have found in preliminary studies, a population of periaqueductal gray
dopamine (PAGDA) neurons that project to the BNST that exhibit anti-nociceptive properties when activated,
highlighting the possibility that dopamine in the BNST is a critical suppressor of pain-related behaviors. Previous
studies have found that these PAGDA neurons play a key role in opioid induced anti-nociception. The objective
of this proposal is to rigorously and mechanistically determine the role of the PAGDA to BNSTCRF circuit in
inflammatory pain-driven changes in behavior, with the long term goal of identifying new treatments for
inflammatory pain. We have collected strong data showing that acute pain engages this circuit, and hypothesize
that this initial engagement leads to plasticity contributing to the persistence of inflammatory pain, and the
development of emotional behaviors associated with inflammatory pain. This will be accomplished via three
convergent aims"
10827376,"Summary
The overarching goal for this proposed renewal application will be to further advance tools that are in development and to
effectively integrate several types of analytical data with biological assay data and genomic information. This will create a
powerful set of tools for faster and even more accurate identification of new molecules, dereplication of known ones, and
to directly infer biological activities from spectroscopic information. In the current period of support, we have made
substantial progress in developing highly useful tools for automatic annotations and identifications of organic molecules,
specifically focused on natural products. The Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Networking analysis and
knowledge dissemination ecosystem has processed almost 160,000 jobs in nearly 160 countries worldwide, has 4-6,000
new job submissions per month and is accessed over 200,000 times a month (majority accessions are for reference library
access, inspection of public data and previous jobs that the community shares as hyperlinks in papers), and has become a
mainstream tool for the annotation of organic molecules deriving from diverse sources, especially in metabolomics
workflows. The public website for Small Molecule Accurate Recognition Technology (SMART), a deep learning model
for providing candidate structures based on 1H-13C HSQC NMR data, went live in December 2019 and already has over
3000 jobs in 50 countries. All tools developed in this proposal will become part of this analysis ecosystem. The four
laboratories contributing to this proposed research activity have created an open and integrated team that is continuing to
creatively innovate new informatic tools to enhance small molecule structure annotations and inference of their chemical
and biological properties. We have four specific aims: 1) To complete the development and evaluation of a set of new
and innovative tools for natural products analysis, and deploy these as freely available resources for the worldwide
community. 2) To refine the structural characterization of molecules through leveraging repository scale mass
spectral information along with NMR data and genomic inputs. 3) To create a new SMART-based tool that
integrates mass spectrometry and HSQC NMR data as the input for a new deep learning system with the goal of
achieving more accurate predictions of structure. 4) To use deep learning to enhance SMART with bioactivity data
so as to enable SMART to predict activities of molecules based on spectroscopic features. The data will also augment
the GNPS database with biological assay binding data. An additional consequence of these goals will be the further
digitization of natural products analytical data so that they can be used in the computational tools planned herein, as
well as other tools in the future. Completion of these four specific aims will create new integrated tools for the precise
identification of new natural product structures, and enable inference of their structural relatedness to other classes of
organic molecules and their biological properties. Thus, these new informatic tools will have the potential to greatly
enhance the small molecule drug discovery process.

10818505,"Summary. In triple-negative breast cancer and high-grade serous ovarian cancer, the emergence of resistance
to therapy is virtually inevitable and contributes to dismal long-term patient outcomes. The team will test the
hypothesis that tumor ecosystems rapidly adapt to stress engendered by therapies, leading to the rapid
emergence of resistance. As a corollary, blocking adaptive responses in tumor cells and the immune
microenvironment will interdict the emergence of resistance. The objective is to monitor mechanisms underlying
adaptive responses across temporal and spatial scales with single-cell precision, predict responses to untested
combinatorial perturbations, and validate predicted drug combinations, fueling future clinical trials. An interactive
team with diverse and complementary expertise and long collaboration history has been assembled: cancer and
systems biology and therapeutics (Mills, contact PI, OHSU), computational biology/image analysis (Korkut, PI,
MDACC; Goecks, OHSU), bioinformatics and systems biology (Liang, PI, MDACC), single-cell transcriptomics
and proteomics (Mohammed, OHSU), molecular and anatomic pathology (Corless, OHSU; Sahin, MDACC), and
ovarian and breast cancer translational research (Westin, MDACC; Mitri, OHSU). We will pursue two specific
aims. Aim 1. Develop novel algorithms to create mechanistic maps of adaptive responses to therapeutic stress.
The team will innovate algorithms to build data-driven and predictive models encompassing tumor cell signaling,
microenvironment, and immune modulation. An extensive pre-existing longitudinal proteomics dataset of cell
lines, xenografts, novel murine transplantable syngeneic models, PDXs, and patient samples will serve as the
experimental data and constraints driving model construction. The modeling approaches will identify cellular
vulnerabilities arising from adaptive responses to therapeutic stress and predict responses to untested
combinatorial perturbations. The team will also determine whether therapeutic targeting “steers” proteomically
heterogeneous tumors to a more therapeutically tractable homogenous state. For this purpose, we will use state-
of-the-art multiplexed imaging-based proteomics technologies to formulate and implement data-driven models
at spatial and single-cell precision. The single-cell, data-driven modeling will demonstrate how targeted therapies
alter the tumor and immune microenvironment, leading to therapeutic vulnerabilities that new targeted therapy
or immunotherapy combinations could exploit. Aim 2. Validate rational drug combinations targeting adaptive
responses to therapy in relevant settings. The team will use cell lines, xenografts, PDXs, and novel murine
transplantable syngeneic models to validate the therapeutic tractability of the rational drug combinations
predicted by the data-driven models under Aim 1. Importantly, the experimental assessment will inform and
improve the computational models through iterative data acquisition and subsequent remodeling. Novel therapy
combinations will be assessed through clinical trials supported by other funds. The emerging principles and tools
are highly applicable to other cancer lineages and could provide broad benefits."
10814905,"PROJECT SUMMARY RESEARCH PROGRAM 
The overarching goal of the JAX Cancer Center (JAXCC) Research Program, Genetic Models for Precision 
Cancer Medicine, is to advance the vision of precision oncology through basic research discoveries with 
potential for translational and clinical impact. Members use diverse, multi-scale strategies to deconvolute 
complex cancer systems to their principal components and to investigate the drivers of cancer cell complexity, 
tumor evolution, and tumor adaptation. Elucidating these fundamental biological processes are key to a 
principled, mechanistic understanding of the adverse effects of cancer therapy and of treatment resistance. 
During the current funding period we have expanded, and reshaped, the JAXCC into a new cancer research 
force with a focus on complex genetics and functional genomics. Research is organized around three 
complementary Specific Aims. Aim 1 seeks to develop novel organismal, cellular, and computational models of 
cancer, drawing on the JAXCC's longstanding strengths in model development. Aim 2 examines the genomic 
instability and genetic complexity of cancer and determines their functional consequences in the cancer cell. 
Using advanced computational methods and genomic technologies we will interrogate animal models developed 
in Aim 1 as well as patient samples. Aim 3 investigates how key components of a tumor and the host contribute 
to cancer biology, examining the cancer cell intrinsic and extrinsic components of a malignant tumor. Results 
from studies in Aim 3, integrated with the genetic alterations identified in Aim 2 with models developed in Aim 1, 
will allow us to deconvolute the complex interactions of the tumor and host microenvironments. The 53 full 
program members of the JAXCC include 33 on the Bar Harbor campus and 20 on the Farmington campus. 
Through its emphasis on basic research, unique model development, and technological innovation, the program 
leverages funding from multiple NIH ICs in support of cancer-focused research. More recently, we brought our 
technologies into the clinical arena through collaborations with SWOG, the Maine Cancer Genomics Initiative, 
City of Hope, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, University of Connecticut Health Center, and the 
Connecticut Children's Hospital. The program is supported by $10,401,511 direct costs in NCI and other peer- 
reviewed cancer-related grants in the last budget year. Over the last grant cycle, CCSG funds have supported 
379 publications including 30% intra-programmatic collaborations and 72% with external collaborators. The 
efforts of the Co-Program Leaders, Drs. Karolina Palucka and Roel Verhaak, and JAXCC leadership have 
fostered interactivity among JAXCC members through regular Research Program meetings, subsidized travel 
between campuses, and the JAXCC Annual Retreat. The annual JAXCC Retreat and monthly program meetings 
are the primary forums that bring together Cancer Center members from both campuses to develop intra- 
programmatic collaborations and to participate in the planning for resource development and faculty recruitment."

The Fred Hutch/University of Washington Cancer Consortium aims to be at the forefront of training the next 
generation of scientists and clinicians to best position them to lead efforts to eliminate cancer. Education and 
training has always been a core value and central to our mission, and we propose here to continue to 
emphasize and enhance our training mission and footprint. The specific aims for CRCE are (1) to provide 
exceptional training and support for graduate students and postdoctoral and clinical fellows so that they will be 
poised to tackle a range of careers in cancer research; (2) to encourage young students to engage in and 
experience science and to provide exposure and opportunities for those from groups that are 
underrepresented minorities (URMs) in science; (3) to maximize the success of junior faculty through 
mentoring and support as they transition to independent scientists; and (4) to support the pipeline of 
educational and training opportunities of the Consortium. 
To support our training efforts, we host a large and comprehensive set of T32 grants (n=47), of which 32 have 
Consortium faculty as mentors, 17 are led by Consortium PIs, and 7 are from NCI. The eight T32s with the 
strongest cancer focus collectively support 39 trainees/year, and an additional 95 trainees are supported by 
T32s that include cancer research as a component. Some of these grants have been in continuous existence 
for more than 4 decades (e.g., Molecular & Cellular Biology, Medical Scientist Training Program, Medical 
Genetics, Hematology). The caliber of our trainees and their success is illustrated by current active awards of 1 
K99 grant, 6 K01 or K22 grants, 10 F32 grants, 2 Jane Coffin Childs Fellowships, 4 Damon Runyon Cancer 
Research Awards, and 4 Susan G. Komen Fellowships. This Cancer Research Career Enhancement (CRCE) 
component will serve as a centralized resource that integrates and supports these efforts, encourages the 
continuum of training and mentoring, and supports continued innovation in our education pipeline."

Protein lipidation is a dynamic post-translational modification (PTM) that affects subcellular
trafficking, co-factor binding affinity, and membrane localization of proteins, which in turn
influence downstream signaling cascades. In particular, cyclic S-acylation and -deacylation of
proteins at specific cysteine residues is emerging as a key link between circulating lipid levels and
the regulation of essential biological processes, including those involved in cellular growth,
metabolism, and neurological health. In-depth study of this PTM, however, has proven technically
difficult, in large part due to the paucity of selective, effective chemical inhibitors for the enzymes
that catalyze its installation and removal. The proposed research program is designed to
generate novel chemical technologies, namely small molecule probes and inhibitors, in the
service of illuminating the involvement of regulated protein S-acylation in both normal and
pathophysiological contexts. These goals will be realized through two complementary chemical
and cellular biology research areas. One area will involve measuring, manipulating, and
determining the targets of the “writers” of S-acylation, DHHCs. To do so, pan-active DHHC
inhibitors will be identified using newly developed and optimized screening and selectivity profiling
assays in combination with rationally and computationally designed molecules, as well as a
library of putative inhibitors. Validated inhibitors and proteomics-based methods will then be used
to identify the specific protein targets of DHHCs in live cells to more precisely describe their
involvement in various disease states. The second research area will utilize our recently validated
chemical tools to study the biological function of the “erasers” of S-acylation, APTs, with particular
emphasis on the involvement of these enzymes in cellular redox homeostasis and metabolic
disease. The expected outcome of this multidisciplinary research program is two-fold: generating
a collection of chemical tools and assays for the study of this important PTM, and describing its
biological function and influence in normal and disease states."
10842258,"ABSTRACT
The U.S. healthcare system cares for increasing numbers of older adults, including those with Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias, who require surgery with anesthesia. Regional social inequities, as measured
by spatial indices such as area deprivation and social vulnerability indices, independently contribute to
differences in perioperative and neurodegenerative outcomes. Data also support a significant association
between neighborhood-level area deprivation indices with Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology. Despite
emerging evidence linking social determinants of health with disparities in postoperative outcomes in older
adults, investigations in these areas increasingly require expertise with disparate subject matters, including
clinical perioperative practice, geriatrics, neuropsychology, social determinants of health, geospatial analyses,
and even artificial intelligence. The K07 applicant is a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded independent
investigator and fellowship-trained anesthesiologist with expertise in regional anesthesia and orthopedic surgery,
as well as research experience in machine learning, geospatial disparities, and perioperative pain and cognition.
The purpose of this proposal is to promote institutional and community awareness of how social vulnerabilities
impact perioperative outcomes in older adults, including those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias,
and particularly those outcomes related to postoperative pain and cognition. The overall strategy of this proposal
is to develop interdisciplinary research infrastructure along with transdisciplinary training programs to
crosspollinate research teams. This structure will be organized via the Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia
Network-Social Vulnerability (PeCANSV) construct in three aims: Aim 1: Convene a PeCANSV multidisciplinary
advisory team to establish three supplemental cores in 1) geospatial infrastructure; 2) social determinants of
health; 3) artificial intelligence. Aim 2: Accelerate research discovery through interdisciplinary research pathways
by formalizing nascent linkages between supplemental PeCANSV cores and UF resources and extant geospatial,
environmental, cognitive, and clinical perioperative databases at UF Health and throughout Florida. Aim 3:
Develop a transdisciplinary workforce of clinical and basic science researchers to lead interdisciplinary teams
addressing the social vulnerability of older adult surgical patients. Milestones include regular analysis of
strengths, opportunities, aspirations, and results, interdisciplinary proposal submissions, and evidence of trainee
success in perioperative research in social disparities of older adults, including those with Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias."
10789897,"PROJECT SUMMARY
African-American Veterans are at particular risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality and hospitalization,
due to adverse social determinants of health (SDoH) including poor transportation access and housing
instability. Identifying individuals at risk of adverse outcomes has been a priority at the Veterans Health
Administration (VA), which has implemented novel predictive analytic tools in clinical care settings to target
care resources efficiently and equitably. The VA has invested an average of 5% of total VA spending towards
health information technology to support such algorithms. One predictive algorithm implemented nationwide
and commonly used by VA clinicians is the Care Assessment Needs (CAN) score, which predicts risk of future
hospitalization and/or death for over 5 million Veterans receiving primary care. The CAN score is currently
used by patient-aligned care teams (PACTs) and nurse care navigators to direct clinical programs and
resources, including telehealth, palliative care, and home-based primary care, to high-risk Veterans.
The CAN score is primarily based on laboratory, demographic, utilization, and other administrative data.
Recent studies have shown that similar algorithms used in non-VA settings may mischaracterize risk for
vulnerable patient subgroups – including African-Americans – whose health is heavily influenced by
disproportionate exposure to adverse SDoH. Importantly, race and SDoH are not routine inputs into the CAN
score. There is a growing concern that algorithms like the CAN score could generate “algorithmically unfair”
predictions that systematically mischaracterize risk for subgroups – particularly African-Americans – whose
care is heavily influenced by SDoH. However, there has been no systematic investigation into unfairness of the
CAN score between African-American and White Veterans.
In this project, we will systematically examine algorithmic unfairness in the VA CAN algorithm and develop
approaches to mitigate it, including testing the incorporation of SDoH metrics. Our preliminary investigations
into the CAN score show that it underestimates risk for African-Americans compared to White Veterans, which
may lead to fewer referrals of high risk African-American Veterans to clinical programs. In Aim 1, we will
develop methods to mitigate algorithmic unfairness in the CAN score using its existing variables. In Aim 2, we
will incorporate race and select metrics of SDoH that are available through VA screening efforts into the CAN
score to improve algorithmic unfairness. In Aim 3, we will use the “Fair” CAN score generated in Aim 2 to
investigate how mitigating unfairness would change the racial composition of Veterans enrolled in clinical
programs targeted at high-risk Veterans."
10834117,"Project Summary
Ovarian/extra-uterine high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common and aggressive type of ovarian
cancer. It often has no symptoms at early stages and over 80% of patients are diagnosed at advanced, usually
incurable, cancer stages, when the tumors have already metastasized. Extensive integrated genomic analysis
allowed identification of several clinically distinct subtypes of HGSC. A significant fraction of HGSC arises from
the tubal epithelium (TE) located in the distal region of Fallopian tube (aka uterine tube or oviduct). Recent single
cell transcriptome analysis of distal TE inferred that HGSC heterogeneity could be connected to diverse cell
states present in TE cell lineages. Unfortunately, precise cell lineage-based hierarchy of identified TE cell types
has not been yet established. Furthermore, cancer-prone cellular states of TE are insufficiently defined and
factors influencing such states remain unclear. Thus, it remains unknown if uneven clinical course of HGSC and
development of cellular therapeutic responses may reflect different modes of initiation and progression of this
malignancy. Our preliminary studies show that, in addition to known secretory (OVGP1+) and ciliated (FOXJ1+,
CD24+) epithelial cells, there are several epithelial cell populations characterized by preferential expression of
stem/progenitor cell markers, such as SLC1A3, CD49f (ITGA6), and KLF6. A Monocle cell-lineage trajectory
prediction analysis of our single-cell transcriptomic data identified a population of SLC1A3+ stem/progenitor cells
that give rise to both secretory and ciliated cells by progressing through transient intermediates, including a
KRT5+ cell population. This prediction has been confirmed by lineage tracing of SLC1A3+ cells and ex vivo
studies. Cells in a transient state (CD24med CD49f+) form spheres in consecutive rounds of sphere dissociation-
regeneration and express KRT5. Under normal homeostatic conditions, KRT5+ cells are largely dormant and
minimally contribute to secretory and ciliated cell lineages. However, KRT5+ cells become actively involved in
re-epithelialization after mechanical damage. Our preliminary results suggest that stromal charges begin to co-
evolve with mutant epithelial cells before the earliest morphologically detectable alterations. Based on previous
studies and our preliminary results we hypothesize that cancer-prone TE cell states are determined by levels of
epithelial damage and stromal milieu changes. To test this hypothesis we propose (1) to establish the role of
specific cell states during homeostatic and posttraumatic regeneration, (2) to determine the impact of epithelial
damage on cancer susceptibility of epithelial states and (3) to identify and characterize epithelial and stromal cell
lineage dynamics during early stages of TE malignant transformation."
10811610,"Thyroid hormone (TH) molecules enter cells via membrane transporters and, depending on the cell type, can be activated, that is thyroxine (T4) to 3,5,3'-tri-iodothyronine (T3) conversion, or inactivated - T3 to 3,3'-diiodo-L-thyronine (T2) or T4 to reverse tri-iodothyronine (rT3) conversion. These reactions are catalyzed by the deiodinases. The biologically active hormone, T3, eventually binds to intracellular TH receptors (TR), TRα and TRβ, and initiate TH signaling, i.e. regulation of target genes and other metabolic pathways. At least three families of transmembrane transporters, MCT, OATP and LAT, facilitate the entry of TH into cells, which follow the gradient of free hormone between the extracellular fluid and the cytoplasm. Inactivation or marked downregulation of TH transporters can dampen TH signaling. At the same time, dynamic modifications in the expression or activity of TRs and transcriptional co-regulators can affect positively or negatively the intensity of TH signaling. However, the deiodinases are the element that provides greatest amplitude in dynamic control of TH signaling. Cells that express the activating deiodinase DIO2 can rapidly enhance TH signaling due to intracellular build-up of T3. In contrast, TH signaling is dampened in cells that express the inactivating deiodinase DIO3. This explains how THs can regulate pathways in development, metabolism and growth, despite rather stable levels in the circulation. As a consequence, TH signaling is unique for each cell (tissue or organ), depending on circulating TH levels and on the exclusive blend of transporters, deiodinases and TRs present in each cell. In this article we explore the key mechanisms underlying customization of TH signaling during development, in health and in disease states."
10843934,"PROJECT SUMMARY
My laboratory innovates mass spectrometry (MS) technology to accelerate the pace, depth, and accuracy of
proteome analysis and applies these technologies to globally access proteome structure, function, and
regulation. Signature achievements include the development of electron-transfer dissociation (ETD), the GC-
Orbitrap mass spectrometer, novel protein quantification technologies, and the targeted technique parallel
reaction monitoring – to name a few. Having established our reputation in proteomics instrumentation, our
mission came to include the investigation of the metabolome and lipidome. The rationale is simple: fully
understanding a biological system requires knowing the interplay between molecular classes. We have
demonstrated the capability of these technologies to propel numerous projects in the fields of metabolism,
developmental, and systems biology.
Building on my program’s expertise in the analysis of disassembled molecular machinery (i.e., shotgun
proteomics), we have turned our attention to the machine as a whole, i.e., protein structure. By combining
technologies from MS and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) our aim is to maximize the information
garnered from a single sample to provide insight into protein structure with unprecedented speed and simplicity.
That is, we compound the orthogonal information offered by MS measurements of chemical makeup with atomic-
level information afforded by cryo-EM imaging. Further, drawing on concepts from astrophysics already resonant
with MS, we anticipate that our highly creative method will overcome pervasive bottlenecks in cryo-EM sample
preparation that often limit image resolution. To that end, we have adapted a mass spectrometer to purify and
land native protein complexes on cryogenically cooled TEM grids, which are then coated with amorphous ice in
vacuo. The resulting grid would represent the ideal cryo-EM sample – a high density of particles situated in
random orientations in the same focal plane and covered with only a few nanometers of ice. We plan to achieve
even greater structural insight through the incorporation of gas-phase dissociation techniques, which partition
the macromolecule into its subcomponents. In particular we propose the addition of surface-induced dissociation
(SID) and activated-ion ETD (AI-ETD) to the mass spectrometer used for grid preparation. In short, this
technology has genuine potential to create a new paradigm of proteome-scale structural biology."
10816440,"The Administrative Core (Core A) is led by Dr. Michela Gallagher, who serves as the P.I. of this
Program Project grant. The Administrative Core plays an integral role in the research program by coordinating
activities and interactions between the Cores and individual projects. The roles of the Administrative Core
include 1) animal/tissue assignment to the Projects from Core B, 2) transfer of Core B data for routine analysis
and archiving by Core C, and 3) oversight of data transfer from the Projects to Core C, achieving an
organizational structure whereby all records of planned research, active experiments, and completed research,
including publications, are coordinated and maintained with a central point of contact.
 The Administrative Core provides leadership for the organization of program events and meetings,
including meetings with our external scientific advisory board. The participation of a scientific advisory group in
our planning/review process provides valuable oversight and consultation. In addition to such meetings, all
investigators, including Core and Project Leaders are updated on the work in the research program through
regular group meetings and Core A’s internal data sharing function. Together, these activities are integral to
guiding the research program through each annual cycle of planning, discovery, and evaluation of research
findings. In these functions, the Administrative Core contributes significantly to the integration of work in the
research program across Projects with transparency and building consensus on decisions.
 The Administrative Core has well-established procedures for all of its functions. With respect to the
assignment of resources for experiments (animals and tissue), under our long-established system, unique
identifiers for each subject/sample ensure that studies in the Projects are conducted blind with respect to
cognitive status. Data transfer through the Administrative Core to Data Management (Core C) provides a clear
point of contact to ensure complete archiving (data obtained/transferred for all assigned animal resources) and
for tracking progress on research in the Projects. The meetings of the entire program project, along with
updates managed by the Administrative Core, are integral to the review of our progress, plans for the future,
and integration of the program. The Administrative Core also provides routine support for the overall Program
Project (oversight of finances, compliance with all NIH guidelines, progress reports and continuation
applications). Finally, in addition to its functions in resource sharing (animals/tissue, data) within the research
program, the Administrative Core also oversees, manages, and coordinates targeted resource sharing with
outside investigators."
10816446,"A major objective of the overall research program is to elucidate the basis of neurocognitive aging in
behaviorally characterized healthy aged rats. The Animal Resource Core (Core B) is an essential component
of the research program in its study of neurocognitive aging to provide young and aged rats to each of the
Projects. The overall research program further exploits the feature of individual differences in neurocognitive
aging, a phenomenon that is well-documented in humans and captured in the animal model used in this
research. The many years of work with this outbred model of male Long Evans have established that a
subpopulation at older ages exhibit impaired performance while other rats in the aged cohort maintain
preserved performance on a par with young adults. These well-characterized individual differences have been
used successfully to examine neurobiological variations in the medial temporal lobe that are closely coupled
to cognitive outcomes. Core B under this application will add female Long Evans rats to the resource for
studies of individual differences with sex considered as a biological variable in accordance with NIH
guidelines.
 The Animal Resource (Core B) maintains the colony of pathogen-free Long-Evans rats, which are
additionally screened for disability and physiological impairment. Under a standardized protocol reproductive
status is obtained for all female rats and maintained in the data archive. All rats in the Animal Resource
undergo assessment of cognitive function in a standardized protocol for “place” and “cue” learning in a water
maze apparatus. The Animal Resource together with the Data Management (Core C) provides routine
analysis of these results to characterize presence/severity of impairment. The Animal Resource compiles
records on animal health, inventory, and analysis of the behavioral assessments, all in an archived form
maintained by Core C (Data Management and Statistics).
 Animals from the resource are then made available to the Projects for further studies including any Project-
specific procedures assigned to Core B, with assignments under the supervision of the Administrative Core
(Core A). In many instances live animals are transferred from the Resource to projects for further in vivo
analysis (i.e., electrophysiological recording, additional behavioral assessment) or to provide fresh tissue as
needed for in vitro studies.
 In addition to providing rodent material for current projects, Core B also banks tissue specimens (dissected
brain regions, peripheral organ tissues, blood samples) to be used at a later date by project investigators or
outside scientists. Specimens from both male and female rats will be provided for comparison to STARRRs
(NOT-AG-19-017) as described in the narrative. The resource sharing activity is managed and coordinated by
the Administrative Core (Core A)."
10816452,"This Data Management and Statistics Core (Core C) has played an essential role in the research program over
its 25-year history. The Data Management and Statistics Core will continue to serve the overall research
program and each of the component projects (Projects 1-4), along with the Animal Resource (Core B).
The Core will provide expertise in statistics and experimental design to all projects under their respective
research plans. This function of the Core is critical in the design and analysis of experiments that provide
increasingly complex data and may benefit from analytical methods beyond the expertise of Project Leaders.
Core C personnel with statistical expertise will participate in all research planning meetings (as described in
detail in Core A). Continued consultation with investigators during the conduct of the research, data analysis,
and preparation of publications will occur between this Core and the Projects. In these activities the Core
maximizes communication across all project components to further the understanding of data to be analyzed,
statistical procedures for those analyses, and appropriate interpretation of findings.
This Core continues to develop and implement data management strategies to process and document all data
collected in Core B (Animal Resource) and in the Projects. Through its data management activity the Core will
continue to build an archive of data generated under this mechanism of support. Because all data are keyed to
the age and cognitive status of AI and AU rats, and each subject has a unique identifier that links subject data
across datasets, many opportunities exist for comparison of data in this animal model across studies and
projects. These archives serve all members of the investigative group and constitute a highly valuable base of
information in the area of neurocognitive aging. Specific personnel in Core C are tasked with the database
resource development and data management.
Large archives of data (e.g. behavioral data and health records from the Animal Resource, microarray datasets
in basal and experimental conditions) are managed in an accessible format for internal use and for data
sharing both within the Program Project and with outside investigators, the latter under the supervision of Core
A."
10816455,"The hippocampus and medial temporal lobe are crucial components of the brain’s declarative memory system.
Extensive damage to these structures results in devastating and permanent loss of the ability to form new,
conscious memories of facts and personal experience. Aging is strongly associated with loss or change of
memory functions, in both normal aging and in neuropathological conditions. The lateral entorhinal cortex
(LEC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) provide the large majority of medial temporal lobe input to the
hippocampus. The MEC appears to provide the hippocampus with a signal about the spatial location of an
organism. This signal is thought to act as a framework that allows the hippocampus to bind together the
individual components of an experience that occur at a moment in space and time. This framework allows the
hippocampus to form a coherent representation that is stored and later retrieved as an episodic memory. The
role of the LEC in this system has been less explored. The LEC may represent the individual components that
make up the content of an episodic memory. However, this role has not received as much experimental
investigation and validation compared to the role of MEC. Because the LEC is particularly vulnerable in the
early stages of age-related memory impairment, including Alzheimer’s Disease, it is imperative to understand
in detail the types of information represented in LEC and the neural coding mechanisms that underlie these
representations. Recent studies have provided two fundamental insights into LEC neural representations: (1)
LEC encodes a temporal context signal that allows the brain to represent and distinguish memories of events
that occur at different points in time; and (2) LEC represents the bearing of external items relative to the
observer in an egocentric frame of reference. The latter insight is consistent with the notion that LEC provides
the hippocampus with first-person information about the content of an episode, experienced and remembered
from an egocentric perspective. We hypothesize that the mnemonic deficits that mark early stages of age-
related cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s Dementia may result from the loss of normal temporal coding and
egocentric coding of the LEC inputs to the hippocampus. To test this hypothesis, we will determine whether
there are differences among young rats, aged rats without memory impairment, and aged rats with memory
impairment in these properties of LEC neurons. These experiments promise to provide crucial new data and
insights into how medial temporal lobe dysfunction produces the mild to severe memory impairments that can
range from minor inconvenience to devastating incapacity in aged individuals."
10816460,"Our research program under this funding mechanism has provided evidence for specific effects of aging
on medial temporal lobe (MTL) circuits that contribute to individual differences in cognitive outcomes in
aging. Because advancing age represents the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), individual
differences in aging itself may confer risk or resilience for that disease, indicating potential relevance beyond
the limited condition of age-related cognitive impairment. Project 2 investigates circuit-specific mechanisms
within the broad memory system network that underlie individual differences in both impaired and preserved
cognitive outcomes, and considers sex as a potential factor for differential vulnerability to decline. As first
described in our research with outbred Long-Evans male rats characterized for age-related impaired memory
(AI), a condition of neural overactivity in the MTL translated in clinical observational studies of elderly
individuals, with further augmentation in aMCI patients at greater risk for late onset AD. Within the aged rat
study population, our background research demonstrated that neural overactivity contributes to memory
impairment by using experimental intervention with therapeutics, a finding that has also translated
therapeutically in clinical studies. Alongside those achievements, accumulating evidence suggests that
adaptive recruitment of inhibitory function beneficially supports resilience to memory decline in aged
unimpaired rats (AU). Research in Project 2 will now examine the functional significance of inhibitory
recruitment as a potentially adaptive mechanism in the preservation of cognitive function in aging. In that
context, Project 2 will investigate a mechanism for homeostatic regulation, to examine loss of function in AI and
potential gain of function in AU. Project 2 will study the condition of this mechanism across the
EC/hippocampal system with anatomical methods for circuit-specific alterations. The CA2 hippocampal
subfield has become an additional subregion of high interest in our model; loss of function contributes to
excess activity possibly contributing to the AI condition while greater recruitment may occur in AU rats, giving a
bi-directional role for homeostatic control in both late life outcomes. Project 2 will also lead in the use of
experimental tools with potential therapeutic relevance, as it has in the past with the Sv2a agent levetiracetam.
Studies under Aim 4 in Project 2 will test agents that act as allosteric modulators of GABAA α5 receptors.
These receptors have highly restricted localization in the mammalian brain and may offer greater precision for
targeting the neurobiological conditions underlying impairment in AI and providing a test for the functional
significance of AU biomarkers, which have indicated augmented inhibition to maintain excitatory/inhibitory
balance in brain aging. Thus, in the research plans in the current application, Project 2 maintains a strong
focus on the relevance of basic research findings for clinical applications."
10816465,"Aging frequently impairs cognitive functions associated with the medial temporal lobe
(MTL), particularly the formation of new memories, and it is also a major risk factor for
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent studies in rodent models and humans identified hyperactivity
in specific circuits/subregions of the MTL, the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and its downstream
target the dentate/CA3 subfields of the hippocampus, as a distinctive feature that associates
with impaired memory in aged individuals. A wealth of experimental and theoretical studies
indicates that the deleterious consequences of hyperactivity are multiple. Hyperactivity not only
compromises normal neural processing and the recruitment of plasticity mechanisms required
for encoding new memories, but it can also accelerate activity dependent pathogenic processes,
like Aβ production/deposition and spread of tau-hyperphosphorylation/toxicity along neural
connections.
 In multiple brain areas, network activity is dynamically controlled primarily by GABAergic
circuits subserved by parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons (PV-INs). Importantly,
mounting evidence indicates that dysfunction of these inhibitory circuits is a contributing factor in
age-related hyperexcitability, particularly in the earliest phases of AD. In adults, the inhibitory
output of the PV-INs is relatively stable, but the excitatory input onto PV-INs is comparatively
dynamic and plastic. In this context, a particularly interesting research target for hyperxcitability
during aging is Neuronal Pentraxin-2 (NPTX2), an extracellular protein released by excitatory
neurons in an activity-dependent manner that is crucial for stabilizing AMPA receptors at
synapses on PV-INs. Importantly, the genetic ablation of NPTX2 reduces these excitatory inputs
by half in mouse cortex, and in elderly humans low levels of NPTX2 in the cerebral spinal fluid
(CSF) correlates with reduced cognitive performance across the spectrum of aging/AD.
 In this proposal we will examine the novel hypothesis that a reduction in NPTX2-
mediated stabilization of the excitatory connectivity onto PV-INs contributes to cognitive
impairment during aging. We will directly evaluate the functional status of multiple excitatory
inputs onto PV-INs within the MTL in a well-characterized rat model for individual cognitive
differences in aging. We will also test whether manipulating NPTX2 affects these inputs as
expected from the hypothesis. Testing the causal effect of NPTX2 in age-dependent cognitive
impairment in a comprehensive manner in multiple pathways, might help identifying potential
therapeutic targets to can alleviate age related cognitive decline."
10816469,"Project 4 examines the role of NPTX2 and homeostatic scaling in age-related cognitive decline. NPTX2 is an
immediate early gene expressed by pyramidal neurons and mediates activity-dependent homeostatic
strengthening of inhibitory circuits by adaptively strengthening excitatory drive of parvalbumin interneurons
(PV-IN). This PPG has examined the effect of aging on cognition using outbred Long-Evans rats and has
documented increased pyramidal neuron excitability and reduced PV-IN circuit inhibition that are associated
with cognitive decline. Preliminary studies further reveal reduced NPTX2 expression in Aged-Impaired rats and
rescue of circuit deficits by NPTX2 transgene expression. Here, we build on these observations and examine
the hypothesis that failure of NPTX2 homeostatic mechanisms contribute to age-related cognitive decline. Aim
1 will test the hypotheses that NPTX2 loss-of-function (LOF) accelerates age-related cognitive decline while
NPTX2 gain-of-function (GOF) delays or prevents age-related cognitive decline. A conditional NPTX2 LOF
model uses a newly developed NPTX2f/f rat together with virus-mediated delivery of Cre to delete NPTX2 at 11
m and together with Core B details the impact on cognitive behavior. In a reciprocal set of experiments, we
create NPTX2 GOF models using two distinct approaches that include virus mediated NPTX2 transgene and
oligonucleotide mediated NPTX2 mRNA stabilization. The impact of GOF on cognitive behavior is evaluated in
collaboration with Core B. Aim 2 examines molecular and cellular mechanisms mediating dynamic targeting of
NPTX2 to excitatory synapses. Studies use state-of-the-art proximity labeling methods to identify proteins
involved in synaptic NPTX2 exocytosis and shedding. Aim 3 uses in vivo 2-photon imaging to examine the
hypothesis that age-related cognitive deficits are associated with disruption of a critical phase of homeostatic
scaling that mediates activity-dependent NPTX2 exocytosis and shedding. Analyses examine diurnal changes
in synaptic NPTX2 in association with waking behaviors and sleep comparing Young, Aged-Impaired and
Aged-Unimpaired rats. We also test the effect of levetiracetam in Aged-Impaired rats. Studies in Aims 1 and 3
include both male and female rats. The Aims are highly synergistic with other Projects and together will reveal
fundamental mechanisms of aging, cognitive resilience and cognitive decline."

10853135,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Air pollution, particularly due to motor vehicles, is a ubiquitous exposure and a significant global health
threat, responsible for many adverse health outcomes. Emerging evidence also suggests that traffic-related
air pollution may be related to lower fecundity and fertility among couples attempting to conceive both with
and without medical assistance. However, the specific pollutants, exposure windows, and biological
mechanisms underlying these associations remain understudied. To address these important knowledge
gaps, this proposal will use a novel and emerging model of human fertility- vitrified donor oocyte assisted
reproductive technology (ART)- to evaluate how air pollution influences human reproduction using a large
cohort of oocyte donors and oocyte recipient couples attending a private fertility clinic in Atlanta, GA (2008-
2019). Residential exposure to traffic-related air pollution will be derived during multiple biologically relevant
windows of exposure in the female donor, female recipient, and male recipient partner using fine-scale
spatiotemporal models of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, fine particular matter (PM), and elemental
carbon as well as sulfur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, PM10 , and PM constituents. Vitrified donor oocyte
ART represents an ideal population to investigate the mechanisms underlying any associations between air
pollution and fertility as exposures to the oocyte and uterine environment are uncorrelated in time or space
and exposures to the oocyte and sperm are uncorrelated during the relevant exposure windows for
fertilization and embryo development. Furthermore, by studying patients undergoing ART, it is possible to
determine exact periods of air pollution exposure and directly observe early reproductive outcomes, such as
fertilization and early embryo development that would never be observed in couples conceiving without
assistance. This research will determine the independent effects of air pollution exposure during oogenesis
and spermatogenesis on fertilization and early embryo development, the independent effects of air pollution
on pregnancy outcomes as mediated through the oocyte and the endometrium, and the extent to which air
pollution affects fertility potential in young, healthy women. Findings from this proposal will have major"
10907420,"Our microbiomes, or the collections of trillions of micro-organisms that live on and within us, are highly dynamic
and have been implicated in a variety of human diseases. Sophisticated computational approaches are critical
for analyzing increasing quantities and types of microbiome data, including time-series, assays for non-bacterial
components of the microbiome, and multiple measurement modalities such as metabolite and gene expression
levels. Another exciting recent trend in the field has been translational applications, particularly live bacterial
therapies for treating human diseases. In parallel, the field of machine learning has been advancing with deep
learning technologies that have dramatically improved applications such as speech and image recognition. My
lab develops novel machine learning methods and experimental approaches for understanding the microbiome,
with a particular focus on microbial dynamics and bacteriotherapies. In the past five years, we have developed
new computational methods and released open-source software tools for assessing the consistency of changes
in the microbiome induced by therapeutics, forecasting population dynamics of microbiomes, and predicting the
status (e.g., presence of disease) of the human host from changes in the microbiome over time. I have also led
experimental efforts to delineate the role of bacteriophages in microbiome dynamics and to develop gut
metabolite-based biomarker assays to predict recurrence of C. difficile infection. Additionally, with collaborators,
we have developed candidate bacteriotherapies for C. difficile infection and food allergies. My overall vision for
my lab in the next five years is to leverage deep learning technologies to advance the microbiome field beyond
finding associations in data, to accurately predicting the effects of perturbations on microbiota, elucidating
mechanisms through which the microbiota affects the host, and improving bacteriotherapies to enable their
success in the clinic. I plan to accomplish this by developing new deep learning models that address specific
challenges for the microbiome, including noisy/small datasets, highly heterogenous human microbiomes, the
need for direct interpretability of model outputs, complex multi-modal datasets, and constraints imposed by
biological principles. My plan is to directly couple computational models and biological experiments through
reinforcing cycles of predicting, testing predictions with new experiments, and improving models. Approaches I
will pursue include incorporating into deep learning models probability, embeddings of microbes and other
entities using rich information (such as gene content or chemical structure), decomposition of multi-modal data
into interpretable and interacting groups, and automated design of new biological experiments in gnotobiotic
mice that seek to maximize information for computational models and ultimately improve engraftment and
efficacy of candidate bacteriotherapies. An important objective will also be to make computational tools that my
lab develops widely available to the research community, through release of quality open-source software."
10909826,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gene expression, the genetic information flow from DNA to RNA to protein, involves delicate regulation by a
group of small non-coding RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs). Dysregulated miRNA networks have been
observed in a variety of disease states including cancer, developmental defects, and neurodegenerative
diseases. In these disease states, the miRNA abundance can be affected at either the degradation or the
biogenesis steps. Target-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD) is a mechanism by which specific miRNAs
undergo degradation when extensively base-paired with their target RNAs. How TDMD may contribute to
different diseases is unclear due to the paucity of known target RNAs (or triggers) that can induce miRNA
degradation. On the other hand, Dicer functions as the central enzyme in processing precursor miRNAs into
mature miRNAs. Dicer deficiency promotes tumorigenesis, but how different miRNAs are affected by lower
levels of Dicer in cancer remains a question. To address these knowledge gaps, we will probe the molecular
regulatory mechanisms of specific miRNA abundance in metazoans focusing on three projects:
1. Expand the repertoire of metazoan TDMD triggers.
We have established CLASH, a combined biochemical and bioinformatics pipeline, for identification of TDMD
triggers in cultured cells. We will further improve CLASH for application in model organisms to identify
conserved and essential TDMD triggers.
2. Investigate the properties of effective TDMD triggers.
Known TDMD trigger sequences are concentrated in conserved regions of the mRNA 3′ UTR and non-coding
RNAs. We will investigate the importance of trigger transcripts sequences, structure and the non-coding
properties in inducing TDMD.
3. Differential Dicer processing of cellular miRNAs.
In an engineered colorectal cancer HCT116 cell line, in which Dicer expression can be fine-tuned by
doxycycline, we will determine the miRNA profile at different Dicer expression levels. Determinants for
differential responsiveness to Dicer of individual miRNAs will be probed by in vitro Dicer cleavage assays and
identification of miRNA binding proteins.
Our unique experimental approaches will provide the basis for developing novel therapeutics through
modulation of the TDMD pathway and Dicer action. Techniques and experience acquired in this project will
prepare our group for future research in exploring molecular machineries that regulate small RNAs essential
for gene expression in normal and diseased tissue."

Lipid-bilayer membranes form diverse and dynamic structures in cells to serve vital functions including nutrient
uptake, waste managements, signal transduction, and so on. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by
which the cell generates and changes its membrane structures has been a central task of cell biology. It is well
established that the physical and chemical properties of membranes regulate their interactions with proteins,
which in turn shape the membrane landscape. However, there are still major knowledge gaps regarding how
proteins act upon different membrane curvature and tension, especially when the membrane structure and/or
the membrane-protein interaction are transient. Cell-free systems using reconstituted membranes provide a
powerful method to study such intricate molecular interplays. However, there is still a pressing need for a
precisely engineered platform that (1) exquisitely controls the geometrical, biochemical and mechanical
properties of membranes and (2) easily allows for biochemical and structural characterization of membrane-
associating proteins. Using DNA nanotechnology, a bottom-up method that generates three-dimensional
molecular assemblies with programmable shape, stiffness, chemical modification, and motion, we propose to
build nanoengineered membranes to bridge the technical gap in membrane manipulation and to unravel the
mechanisms of protein-mediated membrane dynamics. Specifically, we will develop tools to (1) generate
accessible membranes with complex shapes for the quantitative study of curvature-dependent protein-
membrane interactions, (2) build liposomes and lipid nanodiscs with dynamically tunable tension to study the
role of membrane tension in regulating protein conformation and lipid transport, and (3) create transmembrane
nanopores with tunable size and chemical selectivity for the reconstitution of organelle-like compartments. We
expect these new tools to be enabling and potentially transformative for research in structural biology,
biophysics, mechanobiology, and synthetic biology."

Patients with chronic illness who develop acute respiratory failure face significant morbidity and mortality, with
survivors often suffering serious physical and psychological sequelae. These patients have a critical need for
palliative care. Palliative care is focused on improving quality of life for both patients and family of patients with
serious illness by providing high-quality communication, symptom control, and emotional and spiritual support.
Despite how important this type of care is, there is little information available regarding the quality of palliative
care provided to chronically ill patients with acute respiratory failure. Without this knowledge, it is extremely
challenging to develop effective interventions to enhance patient- and family-centered outcomes for this
population.
To fill this key knowledge gap, I will use explicitly defined, measurable items that detail the processes,
outcomes, and structure of palliative care to achieve my primary objective of examining temporal trends in
palliative care over the last decade, including an assessment of changes that have occurred since the
inception of the COVID-19 pandemic. I have identified a cohort of over 16,000 patients with chronic, life-limiting
illness hospitalized with acute respiratory failure between 2012 and 2022. Using this cohort, I will achieve my
primary objective through two specific aims. Aim 1 will examine temporal trends in quality indicators of
palliative care for patients with chronic illness hospitalized with acute respiratory failure between 2012-2022.
Aim 2 will assess differences in quality indicators of palliative care for patients with chronic illness hospitalized
with acute respiratory failure, comparing patients with COVID-19 to those without COVID-19, between 2020-
2022.
By accomplishing the proposed aims, I will identify improvement, stagnation, and decline in care over time in
specific process and outcome metrics across multiple palliative care domains, highlighting significant changes
occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic and identifying differences in quality indicators of palliative care for
those with and without COVID-19. Results from the proposed project will inform my future research to describe
mechanisms underlying these trends, with the goal of developing effective interventions to improve care
delivery for adults with chronic, life-limiting illness and acute respiratory failure."

Cancer evolution constitutes a foremost obstacle to effective treatment, driving malignant cells to adapt
and overcome therapy. Diffuse glioma illustrates the quandary of cancer evolution: despite maximal
treatment, the disease invariably recurs. Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) profiling of
gliomas in the Suvà laboratory showed that defined cellular states, developmental hierarchies and
plasticity coordinate to fuel glioma growth, evolution and resistance to therapy. However, this raises the
critical question of the determinants of glioma cell states. We hypothesize that genetic, epigenetic
and micro-environmental determinants govern the biology of key cellular states that drive
gliomas and their plasticity, calling for an integrative model of cancer evolution, encompassing
all sources of intra-tumoral heritable variations. To address this challenge, the Landau laboratory
developed novel multi-modality single-cell sequencing technologies that enable direct integration
across genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional dimensions of cell-to-cell variation, and have applied
them to study clonal evolution in hematological malignancies. In this R01 co-PI collaborative grant, we
seek to apply this multi-layered single-cell approach to human gliomas in order to define how cellular
phenotypic plasticity and clonal evolution enable tumor cell fitness. Specifically, we will: define intrinsic
and extrinsic determinants of cellular states in glioma (aim1), map the epigenetic encoding of
cell state programs in glioma (aim2), and reconstruct high-resolution lineage histories of glioma
single-cells to measure the heritability and plasticity of cell states (aim3). Altogether, this research
proposal seeks to pioneer the integrative analysis of epigenetic identity with genetic and transcriptional
information to systematically dissect drivers of cellular states that underlie glioma differentiation and
evolution."

Despite the rapid scale-up of lifelong triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) among pregnant women living with HIV
(WLH), children born to WLH continue to have an increased risk of low birth weight (LBW), morbidity, and
mortality compared to infants born to women who are not living with HIV. Although the association between
LBW and decreased child survival has been well studied, the biological mechanisms linking HIV or ART and
LBW are not well described. To better understand how HIV/ART increases the risk of LBW, we leverage an
ongoing, well-characterized cohort of women living with HIV enrolled in a trial of data-driven continuous quality
intervention to improve long term outcomes of ART in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; our specific
focus is on HIV-associated inflammation, immune activation, and microbial communities in the context of
universal ART. A cohort of 600 women living with HIV on ART and 600 HIV-negative control along with their
HIV-exposed un-infected (HEU) and HIV unexposed (HU) infants will be recruited and followed up through
delivery and up to 12 months postpartum to determine how HIV/ART-induced placental dysfunction (Aim 1) or
microbial dysbiosis (Aim 2) modulate the risk of LBW and subsequent infant mortality. Using biological
specimen obtained from those women, we will document histopathologic placental abnormalities (e.g.
necrosis) and measure levels of markers of inflammation, immune activation, and microbial translocation. We
will also use a cutting-edge microbiome and virome toolkit with machine learning and ecosystem modeling
approaches to evaluate associations between these entities and inflammation and LBW, as well as in silico test
myriad mechanistic hypotheses derived from functional analyses. We expect that completion of these
complementary aims will provide insight into the biological mechanism(s) associated with increased risk of
LBW among HIV-exposed infants. This insight could ultimately identify an optimal HIV- treatment or care
modality for pregnant WLH: one which promotes maternal health, prevents HIV mother-to-child transmission,
and maximizes infant survival."
10800664,"Summary/Abstract:
University of California Irvine (UC Irvine) is driven to educate, train, and mentor academically oriented medical
students who will pursue research and become future leaders in medicine. We believe that, “there is no
science tomorrow without training today.” We believe that engaging medical students in research is of
fundamental importance because: 1) it will enhance their ability to more critically evaluate the validity and
efficacy of old and new emerging medical treatments; 2) ipso facto it will better equip them to fulfill their moral
and ethical obligations to provide the best care for their patients; and 3) it will help uncover the “hidden gems”
of medical students that will go on to pursue formal careers as physician-scientists. Therefore, in this NIDDK
T35 application we propose to engage MD students in hands on research, mentoring, publishing, career
development, and leadership in our Summer Mentored Research Training Program (SMART DDK). Through
our expertise in a multidisciplinary “cells to society” approach, we aim to enhance the diversity and availability
of physician scientists to meet the existent and evolving global challenges for improving health by the following
specific aims: 1) providing outstanding leadership and a rigorous process of trainee-mentor alignment; 2)
creating a flexible and innovative curriculum that emphasizes both core competencies and advanced concepts
in NIDDK related research; and 3) maximizing access to the training program. These three specific aims will
emphasize the importance of: 1) Claude Bernard’s “scientific medicine;” 2) Sir Issac Newtons sentiment of
“standing on the shoulder of giants;” and 3) mentoring as reflected by perspective that the quality of science
tomorrow is determined by the training quality of today. Within this context, our trainees will participate in a
Trainee-Mentor Alignment Phase where they will identify a primary mentor, construct an individual
development plan (IDP), and develop a research proposal. The oversight of trainee-mentor alignment,
research proposal, and IDP will occur at regular intervals via formal presentations by the trainee to the
Program Directors, Administrator, and mentor. Additionally, trainees will participate in formal courses,
workshops, journal clubs, and grand rounds to develop a deeper appreciation for issues related to innovation,
foundations of research, and cutting-edge technologies relevant to the realm of NIDDK related research.
Issues related to the responsible conduct of research and reproducibility will be interwoven throughout all
didactic components of the program. In addition to providing guidance to our trainees during their MS1 year,
we will also continue to longitudinally follow their progress and engage the students in research during MS2-
MS4 years via our medical student research program."
10848262,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The ovary and its functional unit, the follicles, are critical for the secretion of sex steroids and peptide hormones
as well as the maturation and release of oocytes for ovulation and fertilization. Increasing evidence has revealed
that a wide spectrum of environmental chemicals and pharmaceuticals cause ovarian toxicity (ovotoxicity) and
heighten the risk of premature ovarian failure, hormonal imbalance, and infertility in both reproductive aged
women and prepubertal girls. With over 85,000 chemicals used in consumer products as well as emerging
contaminants such as harmful algal bloom (HAB) toxins, there are few means to screen for potential toxicity to
the ovaries. We have previously developed an ovary-on-a-chip (OvaryChip) that maintains the 3D architecture
of follicles and produces human menstrual cycle-like follicle development, hormone secretion, oocyte maturation,
ovulation, and luteinization. Yet, one remaining challenge of this innovative model is the critical need to
accelerate throughput. The central hypothesis of this research is that in vitro microfluidic follicular
cultures can be used to identify novel mechanisms of ovarian toxicity for environmental toxicants. In
Aim 1, we will integrate follicle vitrification, 3D in vitro follicle growth, and a new OvaryChip with high-content
culture and imaging to develop a high-throughput ovotoxicity testing of growing follicles. In Aim 2, we will develop
a new OvaryChip for ovotoxicity testing of primordial follicles by using triple transgenic mouse ovarian explants.
In Aim 3, we will develop a liver-ovary-on-a-chip to incorporate liver metabolism into ovotoxicity testing. In these
studies, we will assess follicle and oocyte reproductive outcomes at morphological, functional, and molecular
levels for 1) chemicals with known ovotoxicities (validation studies) and 2) novel HAB toxins alone and in mixtures.
These studies are critically significant because the OvaryChip models will (1) translate a bench assay for a single
compound into a robust high-throughput ovotoxicity screening platform; (2) reveal novel insight into chemical-
induced ovotoxicity (stage- and metabolite-dependent mechanisms); (3) minimize the cost and use of whole
animals; and (4) prioritize chemicals of high ovotoxicity concern, including HAB toxins, for further risk assessment."
10846678,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Single amino acid variants in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) have been
identified by genome-wide association studies to be one of the strongest genetic risk factors for late-onset
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD-associated variants in TREM2 impair TREM2’s ability to bind and signal in
response to endogenous ligands. The molecular mechanisms of TREM2 in AD remain not fully
understood, in part due to the lack of conclusive identities for TREM2’s endogenous ligands and the lack
of a good understanding of how different endogenous ligands interact with TREM2 to affect TREM2
functions. The central hypothesis is that AD-associated variants at TREM2 basic site allosterically
regulate endogenous ligands bound at the hydrophobic site of TREM2, and allosteric co-stimulation by
endogenous ligands at both basic and hydrophobic binding sites could enhance TREM2 immune activity
in AD. The objective is to identify endogenous ligands that bind at the basic and/or hydrophobic sites of
TREM2, determine the allosteric effects of ligand binding at either binding site, and determine the effect of
AD-associated TREM2 variants on endogenous ligands binding to TREM2. We will test the hypothesis
and implement the objective with three Aims. Aim 1 is to identify endogenous ligands of the basic and
hydrophobic binding sites on TREM2. Aim 2 is to determine the allosteric effects of endogenous ligand
binding at both TREM2 binding sites. Aim 3 is to determine the effect of AD-associated TREM2 variants
on endogenous ligands binding to TREM2.
New knowledge could have high impact for AD research and treatment by opening an unrecognized
avenue of targeting both TREM2 basic and hydrophobic sites to identify TREM2 endogenous ligands and
to promote TREM2-regulated immune activation. Research outcomes could aid the development of novel
therapeutic strategies, such as combined drug therapy, to enhance TREM2-mediated cellular activities
and to compensate the loss of TREM2 function by AD-associated variants for AD treatment. Although
immediate potential application for this study is AD pathogenesis, impact on other neurodegenerative and
inflammatory diseases affected by TREM2 activation may be enormous.
Innovations include 1) this will be the first study to identify TREM2 endogenous ligands by targeting both
TREM2 basic and hydrophobic binding sites in a more conclusive manner using the combined in silico
virtual screening, biophysical and biological experiments; 2) Results will unveil novel findings that AD-
associated variants at TREM2 basic site allosterically regulate endogenous ligand bound at TREM2
hydrophobic site, and allosteric co-stimulation by endogenous ligands at both basic and hydrophobic sites
could enhance TREM2-regulated immune activity in AD, providing novel insight into etiology of AD."
10892749,"Program Summary: The Training Program in Reproductive, Perinatal, and Pediatric (RPP) Life Course
Epidemiology – sponsored by the Departments of Epidemiology, Social and Behavioral Sciences, and
Biostatistics at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health – aims to prepare the next generation of life
course-focused, innovative, transdisciplinary investigators in the field of RPP research. The Program is further
supported by the departments of Environmental Health, Nutrition, and Immunology and Infectious Diseases,
reflecting the transdisciplinary nature of RPP life course epidemiology. The Program boasts accomplished
faculty who have worked collaboratively to advance our understanding of the critical issues faced in the field of
RPP life course epidemiologic health research. The overarching goals of the Program are to train pre- and
postdoctoral fellows to become future leading scholars who are: 1) knowledgeable about the current state of
science in RPP life course epidemiology; 2) skilled in advanced epidemiological and biostatistical methods to
undertake RPP life course research; 3) skilled in effective communication, with a strong ability to formulate and
write research proposals and scientific manuscripts for publication, as well as to interpret and disseminate data
to scientific and lay communities; and 4) anchored in peer and professional networks including individual and
group mentorship opportunities that support continuous professional development, leadership, teamwork, and
access to resources to translate knowledge into new independent areas of RPP life course epidemiologic
research. The Program aims to not only develop knowledge, skills, and capacity toward scientific excellence in
RPP sciences, but also inspire a generation of young scholars to adapt to the evolving research climate, which
will increasingly require a transdisciplinary, team-science approach to tackle contemporary and future public
health issues. Thus, pre- and postdoctoral fellows will follow transdisciplinary training involving a combination
of coursework, seminars, practicum, and independent and collaborative research in RPP life course
epidemiology. A key aspect of this application is a cutting-edge mentoring plan, which involves assigning at
least three mentors from different career stages, with expertise in the fellow’s broad area of research interest.
Each fellow will obtain hands-on experience with study planning, data collection, and data analysis in a rich
training environment leveraging well-established cohorts led by Program Faculty, with additional mentoring in
competing for funds, reviewing and publishing, teaching and public speaking, and leadership and citizenship,
which will provide a bridge to launching independent careers in RPP epidemiologic research. Aligned with the
mission of the NICHD, this Program will strive to build capacity toward a scientific workforce that will be
equipped to advance our understanding of significant reproductive, perinatal, and pediatric health issues, and
use cutting-edge evidence to inform clinical practice, translate science into policy action, and implement
prevention strategies to improve the health of women and children across the reproductive life course."
10815795,"Abstract
Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) have the poorest outcome of all the cancers and after a period of
responsiveness, acquired resistance (e.g. T790M mutation) occurs in virtually all NSCLC tumors exposed
to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI). Osimertinib, an irreversible EGFR inhibitor which targets EGFR- T790M
mutations is the first line treatment for mutated NSCLC but resistance develops after 12-24 months. The
checkpoint proteins (PD1, PDL1) and laminB2 (LMNB2) are associated with a poor prognosis in a variety
of cancers. Results from our laboratory have shown that in H1975 tumors (expressing L858R/T790M-EGFR
mutations), downregulation of PDL1 and LMNB2, among other proteins, could significantly reduce tumor
burden in xenotransplanted mice (proteomic analysis. Further, exosomes (EVs) derived from Natural killer
cells (NK92MI, NKEVs) contain various cytolytic proteins and have shown potential as anticancer agents.
In our laboratory, we observed that NKEVs (using a PBS bioreactor with IL-15), showed 40 percent cell kill
at concentration of 1X1010 particles when compared to EVs derived from HEK or MSC cells which showed
15-20 percent cell kill in lung PDX cells. Further, H1975 resistant (H1975R) xenotransplanted tumors when
treated with NKEVs downregulated HO1, vimentin. NF-kB, P38MAPK significantly (P<0.001) as compared
to control and HEK derived EVs suggesting their anticancer role via inducing apoptosis and other possible
mechanisms. Also, NKEVS were found to deliver fluorescent mir3133-TYE effectively in significant amounts
(as compared to control) to H1975R tumors when given intravenously showing their targeting potential.
Further we explored the micro-RNA which regulate LMNB2(mir-3133) and PDL1(mir5193) and showed that
they could significantly downregulate the expression of LMNB2 and PDL1 respectively in vitro and also in
PDX tumors (TM00199, Jackson labs), only when delivered as EV formulations in NSG mice. Hence based
on our strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that NKEVs carrying LMNB2 and PDL1 micro RNA will
deliver their payload to osimertinib resistant NSCLC and will be able to overcome resistance by using in
combination with carboplatin with minimal side effects. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following
independent Aims:
Aim 1: Formulation of NK-EVs containing PDL1 and LMNB2 micro-RNA and evaluating them in vitro in
combination with carboplatin against H1975 (R and wild type) and PDX cells
Aim 2: Toxicological and Pharmacodynamic evaluation of the dual micro-RNA NKEVs in H1975 resistant
and PDX models. The long-term goal of this proposal is to generate enough preclinical data with bioreactor
manufactured NKEVs micro RNA formulations and to understand their role in overcoming resistance so as
to apply for a R01 proposal or Phase 1 clinical studies in the future."

ABSTRACT
The SJSU U-RISE Program is committed to its mission to support the training of underrepresented
students to succeed in PhD or MD/PhD programs in the biomedical sciences, just like our previous
commitment to NIGMS training programs for the past 33 years. The administrative staff of our U-
RISE is made of one PI who is a former MARC director, one Co-PI (a current RISE program
coordinator), and a student coordinator; all three from minority backgrounds. In addition, we have
a highly motivated group of research mentors and a committed institutional administrative staff
who endorse the mission of this prestigious NIGMS program in its entirety. SJSU is a public, PUI
Hispanic Serving Institution, with a large pool of underrepresented students (26%) in the U-RISE
serving departments, which can greatly benefit from the opportunities facilitated by this program.
Recruitment will rely on the ample school database with potential URM applicants, announcements
via website and class visitations, and recommendations from our diligent research faculty. Our
specific and measurable aims incorporate training of mentors to emphasize a student-centered
approach that leads U-RISE trainees to become independent critical thinkers engaged in
meaningful research projects. Trainees will be paired with one mentor whose research aligns with
that of the trainee. To launch trainees into a successful first-year research experience, we will offer
workshop activities that rely on rigor and reproducible approaches that combine hands-on
laboratory techniques and critical thinking skills, followed by a research experience in the PI’s lab.
By the second year, trainees will go away for a summer research experience at a research-
intensive institution. Required components of the program include independent and meaningful
research experience throughout the 2 years in the program, participation in a weekly seminar
during the academic year to learn about professional skills, work on all the documents for
applications to summer programs (first year) and PhD or MD/PhD applications (2nd year) as well
as presentation skills in preparation to present at one of the National Conferences (e.g., SACNAS,
ABRCMS). Additional mentoring will be provided by graduates from our former training programs
who are now in graduate school or are professionals in a range of jobs (academic, industry,
government) in the biomedical sciences and from postdoctoral fellows from Stanford University.
Outcomes will be disseminated through various means, including public websites, posters in the
science building, recordings of trainees’ testimonies, classrooms visitations, during freshman
orientation, and STEM events such as our Student Research Day."
10757650,"ABSTRACT
The first steps in atherosclerosis are the transendothelial movement and subendothelial accumulation of
lipoprotein lipid. Endothelial cell (EC) transcytosis of LDL involves two receptors, scavenger receptor-BI (SR-BI)
and activin-like kinase 1 (ALK1). We showed that ECs also internalize undigested chylomicrons via SR-BI and
process them in lysosomes, leading to storage of some lipid as lipid droplets and the release of small extracellular
vesicles (sEVs) that cause lipid accumulation in macrophages. While many have considered chylomicrons as
non-atherogenic and too large to cross the EC barrier, this concept is now outdated with the understanding that
lipoprotein entry into the artery is a receptor-mediated process. The overall goal of this project is to determine
how EC chylomicron uptake affects EC biology, delivers lipids to the artery, and accelerates atherosclerosis. In
Aim 1, we propose to determine how triglyceride-rich lipoproteins affect lipid transfer across the vascular
endothelium. We provide preliminary data suggesting that N-terminal apoB18 has separate ligand binding
regions for ALK1 and SR-BI. We will determine whether lipoprotein size or apoB length determines exposure of
these two different regions. We also will determine how sEVs from chylomicron-conditioned ECs cause lipid
accumulation in macrophages and determine the differences between sEVs released from control and
chylomicron-treated ECs. In Aim 2, we propose in vivo studies to determine the role of the EC-chylomicron
uptake pathway in tissue lipid delivery and atherosclerosis. We provide preliminary data suggesting that
chylomicrons that accumulate in lipoprotein lipase (LpL) deficient mice increase atherosclerosis. We will use
genetically modified mice and knockdown strategies to assess the uptake of LDL and chylomicron lipids into
arteries and will assess whether more extensive atherosclerosis in mice with combined deficiency of LpL and
the LDL receptor is due to hyperchylomicronemia. Finally, we will determine whether AAV-mediated
overexpression of apoB18 reduces EC uptake of apoB lipoproteins in vivo and alters atherosclerosis. Completion
of the proposed studies promises to alter our view of the relationship of chylomicrons to vascular disease, define
a novel pathway for arterial accumulation of atherogenic lipids, and illustrate a possible approach to prevent
these lipids from entering the artery."
10806950,"My laboratory recently uncovered an unexpected and intriguing role for a lymphatic vessels during skin wound
healing. In particular, we identified that mice without lymphatic vessels display hypervascular regeneration and
fibrosis after injury. Our findings are important for several reasons. First, while lymphatic vessels have been
shown to be important for skin repair, the precise function of these cells in skin repair is poorly understood.
Second, our data reveal that unknown mechanisms involving lymphatic vessels control blood vessel repair and
skin fibrosis, two conditions that impact wound healing and excessive scarring. Finally, lymphedema, a chronic,
debilitating and incurable swelling that can be a result of damage to the lymphatic vessel system due to
surgery, cancer, treatments, or injury, affects over 10 million Americans. Through these focused and
complementary Specific Aims, the work proposed in this application will take advantage of multiple genetic
mouse models that allow specific depletion of lymphatic vessels, state of the art genomics, cell culture models.
We will (1) identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive lymphatic endothelial regeneration in the
skin, (2) analyze the function of lymphatic endothelium cells in suppressing blood vessel repair and
contributing to fibrosis, and (3) define whether enhancing lymphatic vessel repair ameliorates defective wounds
of aged and diabetic mice. These studies will identify specific pro-healing cells and molecular mechanisms that
can be utilized to promote healing in human patients with defective wound healing or lymphatic disorders."

Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death in people living with HIV infection (PLHIV). Despite the
discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) over 100 years ago and the availability of effective drugs for
over 60 years, there remain formidable hurdles for controlling TB including the lack of a highly efficacious
vaccine, long drug treatment regimens, prevention of infection, and killing dormant bacilli within macrophages.
To address these problems, novel research and public health strategies need to be developed and coupled
with enhanced training and local capacity building in high TB endemic countries. Kenya is one of 30 TB high
burden countries which together constitute over 80% of global TB cases. The University of Nairobi (UoN),
the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and the University of Washington (UW) propose a new
TB-HIV Training Program (TBHTP) to address these needs. The TBHTP includes close partnerships in
Kenya with the Ministry of Health National Tuberculosis Leprosy and Lung Disease Program (MoH NTLP), and
the Kenya Pediatric Research Consortium (KEPRECON) – the research organization affiliated with the Kenya
Pediatric Association (KPA). The primary goal of our program is to collaboratively develop training
opportunities to address local needs in training and research capacity building. This partnership builds on a 35-
year history of collaboration and training in HIV research between UW, KEMRI, and UoN. Although this
partnership has been highly successful, TB has not been a high priority or focused goal of previous efforts. To
build the capacity of KEMRI and the University of Nairobi (UoN) to conduct TB and TB-HIV co-infection
research, we propose to implement a long-term training degree-earning track, a medium-term training non-
degree track, and a short-term training track. During the 5-year period, we will train 5 UW MPH, 5 UoN
Fellowship in Epidemiology, and 5 UoN PhD students working at KEMRI, UoN, or the MoH. We will also train
10 medium term non-degree scientists who have interest and potential in TB research will attend UW and take
coursework in epidemiology and biostatistics or work in a laboratory for one to three months before returning to
Kenya and engaging in a mentored research project. Finally, we will conduct short term workshops and provide
on-line courses to build a critical mass of trained researchers who will create a supportive environment for
research in TB. Together, these training opportunities will enhance local capacity and train the next
generation of leaders who will discover novel research and public health strategies to combat the TB
epidemic in Kenya."
10799581,"The major objective of the proposed research is to build a foundation of genomic information and resources for
the scientific community investigating how the oral microbiome contributes to human health and disease. In
prior years of this project we created the expanded Human Oral Microbiome Database (eHOMD), a web
accessible taxonomic and genomic database with taxon descriptions and microbiome analysis tools. We
cultivated reference strains for previously uncultured oral & nasal bacteria to facilitate in vivo and in vitro
experimentation, and we leveraged the sequencing power of the Human Microbiome Project as well as our
laboratory's sequencing facility to generate genome sequences for the majority of oral microbial taxa. In the
proposed project period, our goal is to fill in the major remaining gaps that present a barrier to full realization of
the potential of `omics technologies to drive discoveries in oral microbiology. Our strategy involves three
specific aims. The first Aim encompasses improvements to eHOMD itself, including a significant expansion of
eHOMD to include the viruses that infect oral & nasal microbes. To allow investigators to do more rigorous
microbiome research in mice, a Mouse Oral Microbiome Database (MOMD) will be released so that
investigators can accurately document the composition of their mice's oral microbiome. Completion of this aim
will allow investigators to link phenotypic, clinical, genomic and bibliographic information to precisely-defined
bacterial and phage taxa. The Second Aim addresses the fact that nearly one-third of the 771 eHOMD
bacterial taxa have no known cultivated isolates. We will bring into cultivation strains of oral bacteria that are
currently refractory to cultivation and make these strains available to the research community. For bacteria that
are only sporadically abundant we will use information on abundance of uncultivated bacteria in 20 subjects to
guide sampling efforts, and for bacteria that are common but difficult to grow we will use co-cultivation
approaches that we have previously employed successfully to isolate and grow 30 strains of the previously
uncultivable Saccharibacteria. In the third Aim we will obtain genome sequences for eHOMD taxa currently
lacking genome information. Using long-read sequencing we will produce closed genomes of cultivable strains,
including strains isolated in Aim 2. To provide genome coverage for remaining uncultivable taxa, we will add
high quality Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) to eHOMD. Successful completion of the three Aims
of this project will increase the genomic coverage of oral and nasal taxa to the point where eHOMD is an
exemplary reference database that enables studies using metagenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and
metabolomics to understand the interactions of oral microbes with one another and with their host. The
genome information, tools, and strains generated by this project will serve as a permanent foundation and
resource for investigations on the role of the oral microbiome in human health and disease."
10806163,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Candida albicans is one of the most frequently isolated fungal pathogens of humans. A
critical virulence attribute of C. albicans is its morphogenetic plasticity. In response to
host environmental cues, this fungus can grow as yeast, pseudohyphal, and hyphal
forms. Mutants that are defective in hyphal formation display attenuated virulence in
animal models of systemic candidiasis. Our long-term goal is to understand the signaling
pathways that govern C. albicans morphogenesis. Studies from our laboratory show that
hyphal development consists of two temporally linked phases, initiation and
maintenance. Initiation requires the Ras-cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway that
regulates the rapid but temporary disappearance of the Nrg1 transcriptional repressor of
hyphal development. Maintenance requires the Brg1 transcription factor-mediated
promoter chromatin remodeling of hypha-specific genes in response to nutrient limitation
in air or stabilization of the Ume6 transcriptional activator under hypoxia and
hypercapnia. We have uncovered conserved sensors for N-actylglucosamine (GlcNAc),
CO2, and hypoxia that are linked to hyphal development. In the current proposal, we will
extend these studies through the following aims: Aim 1. Investigate Nrg1 down-
regulation during hyphal initiation. Aim 2. Examine signaling pathways for hyphal
morphogenesis inside macrophage. Aim 3. Identify transcriptional programs under
hypoxia and physiological CO2. This proposal will gain molecular insights into how host
signals are sensed by C. albicans to control hyphal development during infection, which
is critically important in understanding its pathogenicity. The results of these in-depth
investigations will provide new insight into the mechanisms that govern hyphal initiation
and maintenance in an important fungal pathogen, and will serve as the foundation for
novel therapeutic strategies against C. albicans. Furthermore, the signaling pathways to
be examined in this application are likely conserved among diverse fungal pathogens.
Data from these studies will provide insight into signaling pathways that govern virulence
in other fungi."

Policies restricting the sale of flavored tobacco products (FTP) are being enacted in localities around the US.
We seek to expand the evidence base about the extent to which these policies decrease access to FTPs and
exposure to flavored tobacco marketing and would likely reduce use of tobacco among youth and young adults.
Additionally, few studies examine the potential of these policies to reduce tobacco-related health disparities
among youth/young adult populations of color and those of lower socioeconomic status (SES). These vulnerable
populations use flavored products at higher rates and FTPs are heavily marketed in communities where these
vulnerable groups live. Determining the impact of FTP policies overall and on populations of color and lower SES
youth/young adults in these communities can make sure that policies are structured to ensure equitable reach
and reduce tobacco use disparities. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of flavor policies on
reducing exposure to and use of FTPs among vulnerable youth/young adults. Using the Policy Implementation
Framework and the Elaboration Likelihood Model as our theoretical guides, we combine national, local and
individual data to examine the equity impact of flavor policies around the US. To accomplish the study purpose
we will conduct several aims. (1) We will use a longitudinal national dataset of youth and young adults (n=13,892)
followed for nine waves twice a year from 2014 to examine changes in tobacco marketing exposure and FTP
and non-FTP use in those exposed to an FTP policy with no FTP policy exposure over time, focusing on
differences by race/ethnicity and SES. (2) We will compare marketing exposure to and appeal of FTP/non-FTPs
between emerging adults in communities covered by flavor policy variants through ecological momentary
assessment (EMA), evaluating differences in outcomes by SES and race/ethnicity at the individual and
neighborhood level. (3) Finally, among EMA participants, we will assess the predictive validity of exposure to
FTP/non-FTP marketing exposure on use of FTP and non-FTPs at 6-month follow-up, and evaluate whether
these outcomes are associated with SES and race/ethnicity. For all of these activities, we will partner with
national and local FTP policy experts who will disseminate lessons learned to communities who have or are
considering an FTP policy. Achieving the aims of this R01 will expand the evidence base of the impacts of FTP
policies on reducing tobacco use and potential equity impact of these policies to reduce tobacco, and ultimately
cancer disparities."
10817177,"Project Summary
Although smoking prevalence has declined to 13.7% among U.S. adults, smoking rates are much higher
among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults. Lung cancer, which is primarily caused by cigarette smoking,
is the leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. Lung cancer mortality is far greater among those of lower
socioeconomic status (SES) than their higher SES counterparts. Contingency management (CM), the tangible
reinforcement of abstinence and other desired outcomes, is an effective approach to promoting smoking
cessation in a variety of populations. The preliminary work of the investigators has indicated that offering small
escalating financial incentives for smoking abstinence dramatically increases cessation rates among
socioeconomically disadvantaged adults when incentives are included as an adjunct to clinic-based treatment.
However, innovative approaches are needed for those who are unable or unwilling to attend office visits.
Smartphone ownership is rapidly growing, even among low-income adults, and may offer a means of reaching
and increasing treatment access among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults. The purpose of the
proposed project is to evaluate an automated mobile phone-based CM approach that will allow
socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals to remotely benefit from financial incentives for smoking
cessation. The investigators have previously combined technologies including 1) portable carbon monoxide
monitors that connect with mobile phones to remotely verify smoking abstinence, 2) facial recognition software
to confirm participant identity during breath sample submissions, and 3) remote delivery of incentives
automatically triggered by biochemical confirmation of self-reported abstinence. This automated CM approach
will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial that includes 532 socioeconomically disadvantaged males
and females seeking smoking cessation treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to either telephone
counseling and nicotine replacement therapy (standard care [SC]) or SC plus a mobile financial incentives
intervention (CM) for biochemically-confirmed abstinence. Participants will be followed for 26 weeks after a
scheduled quit attempt. Biochemically-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks post-quit will be
the primary outcome variable. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated to inform policy-related decisions. Potential
mobile CM treatment mechanisms, including self-efficacy, motivation, and treatment engagement, will be
explored to optimize future versions of the intervention. Automated mobile CM offers a low-cost approach to
smoking cessation that may be used in combination with existing telephone counseling and pharmacological
interventions. If effective, this approach represents a critical step towards the widespread dissemination of CM
treatment for smoking to practical settings (e.g. state quit lines, healthcare systems), with the goal of reducing
tobacco-related disease and disparities."

The central objective of this Molecular Virology, Viral Pathogenesis and Viral Vectors Training Grant is to train
students in virology so that they can become productive members of the research community. The importance
of virology has been highlighted by reports of the morbidity and mortality caused by viruses long known to infect
humans as well as the emergence of zoonotic virus infections. Thus, there is an urgent need to continue
producing young scientists who are expert in virology. This training grant, which has trained students for 20
years, consists of trainers with interests in a variety of viruses and who are both junior and senior. Our focus is
on understanding fundamental aspects of human virology, with an emphasis on emerging virus infections and
viral pathogenesis and the development and use of viral vectors for gene delivery.
Students who were appointed to the training grant in the past have uniformly completed their Ph.D.s and stayed
in the life sciences. There are 18 trainers from several departments and interdisciplinary programs who serve as
faculty on this training grant. Their research interests range from the study of very basic processes in the
molecular and cellular biology of virus replication, to study of host immune responses to virus infection, to study
of the most efficient mechanisms for gene delivery by viruses. The training grant program is rigorous and
consists of a mixture of didactic courses, seminars, seminar courses which emphasize critical reading of the
literature and data presentation, and teaching opportunities. Trainees are provided feedback in several venues,
to hone their presentation and laboratory skills. Its interdisciplinary nature promotes interaction among students
and faculty interested in virology across the University of Iowa. By providing stipend support and travel funds
for graduate students, the training grant also facilitates exposure of our students to the national and international
virology community. Students selected for support by the training grant will have extra opportunities to teach
classes and to receive funding to attend an off-campus course in a cutting-edge technology, such as bio-

opportunity to interact with visiting virologists. Issues of scientific integrity and data reproducibility are also
emphasized as part of the virology training grant. We also use the training grant as a mechanism for enhancing
racial, ethnic and socio-economic diversity as part of our selection process for trainees. In short, this training
grant has had many years of success and we will build upon this success. We continue to request funds for three
predoctoral graduate students per year, with support generally provided for two years between their second and
fourth years of study."
10799697,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Allergic asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the lung that drives a type 2 cytokine response (such as IL-
4, IL-5, and IL-13) predominately produced by activated CD4 T cells of a Th2 phenotype in response to exposure
with environmental allergens. The master transcription factor GATA3 is known to drive Th2 development and
promote type 2 cytokine production, however, the molecular pathways that drive Th2 cells to allergens at both
the initiation and recall stages are not well understood. We have reported that Blimp-1 is an unexpected driver
of allergic asthma that is critical to promote Th2 cell development in the lung and subsequent airway
inflammation. Blimp-1 is a transcriptional repressor that is pleiotropically expressed by effector T cells and can
regulate effector cell responses to constrain T cell-mediated autoimmunity. The purpose of this proposal is to
understand the tissue-specific environmental niche of the lung that promotes Blimp-1 expression to drive Th2
development in the lung and subsequent inflammation in response to allergens. We have shown that the IL-10-
STAT3-Blimp-1 axis is critical for Blimp-1 to promote Th2 cells in response to inhaled allergens. We now
hypothesize that inhalation of allergens creates a lung-specific inflammatory environment to promote Blimp-1
and drive differentiation Th2 cells in both primary and memory responses to allergen leading to cycle of chronic
lung inflammation. We will explore this hypothesis in three aims: (1) Demonstrate that expression of Blimp-1
requires IL-10 from lung-derived migratory cDC2s produced in response to inhaled allergens. (2) Determine if
the kinetics of Blimp-1 expression in T cells underlie its context-dependent function to drive Th2 differentiation
or constrain effector T cells. (3) Demonstrate that allergen-specific memory T cells require Blimp-1 for Th2 driven
recall responses in the lung. Overall, we will determine the role of Blimp-1 in de novo generation of Th2 cells to
drive a type 2 niche and promote persistent inflammation. This study is significant because of its potential to
identify pathways regulating Th2 cells in response to chronic allergens, as well as to elucidate the context-
dependent function of Blimp-1, an important regulator of effector T cell differentiation and function. This work
therefore will demonstrate how tissue-specific and context-dependent immunity must be considered in
therapeutic approaches for diseases associated with tissues such as allergic asthma."

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted, positive-strand enveloped alphavirus that causes global
disease in humans. At present, no antiviral agents or licensed vaccines exist for the treatment or prevention of
any alphavirus infections. While age, immune status, and pre-existing chronic illness are associated with
increased risk of severe CHIKV infection, the role of acquired factors in disease progression is poorly understood.
Our preliminary data suggests that the microbiota regulates CHIKV infection, dissemination, and musculoskeletal
inflammation and disease through a previously undefined axis by which signals from gut bacteria and bile acids
instruct innate immune cell responses to control CHIKV infection of monocytes in circulation and monocyte
migration to affected joint tissues. We hypothesize that specific gut bacteria and their microbial constituents
modulate CHIKV pathogenesis by regulating antiviral type I IFN and inflammatory responses in pDCs and
monocytes. In the absence of these microbial signals, CHIKV disseminates widely, and arthritis ensues after
joint infiltration by immune cells. This proposal combines investigators with expertise in alphavirus pathogenesis
and immunity (Diamond) and the study of the gut microbiota in disease (Handley, Stappenbeck, and Fischbach).
Using a suite of transgenic mice and microbiome reconstitution experiments paired with detailed virological and
immunological analyses, we will address the following key questions: (a) which immune cells coordinate the
rapid systemic IFN response following CHIKV infection (e.g., pDCs) (b) what immune cues limit viral infection in
circulating immune cells (e.g., monocytes)? (c) how does the gut microbiota regulate pDC IFN production and
trafficking of circulating immune cells? and (d) which constituents (e.g., metabolites) of the microbiota regulate
antiviral and inflammatory responses? Through these detailed mechanistic studies, we expect to link the
microbe-derived constituents of specific commensal bacteria with innate antiviral responses that modulate
alphavirus infection, dissemination, joint disease, and possibly transmission. Beyond enhancing our
understanding of acquired determinants of alphavirus pathogenesis, the findings of this proposal could inform
more generally our understanding of how the gut microbiota shapes innate immune responses to limit infection
and pathogenesis of other viruses."

Histiocytic neoplasms are clonal disorders of the monocyte/macrophage lineage that include Langerhans Cell
Histiocytosis (LCH), Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD), Juvenile Xanthogranuloma (JXG), and Rosai-Dorfman
Disease (RDD). Although the pathogenesis of histiocytoses was previously obscure, it is now known that
nearly every patient with these disorders has a mutation activating MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling, including
BRAFV600E mutations in 50% of LCH and ECD cases. BRAF inhibition is efficacious for those patients with
BRAFV600E-mutant disease and our clinical trial led to FDA approval of vemurafenib for BRAFV600E-mutant ECD
in 2017. Correlative analyses from this study revealed that the allelic burden of mutant cell-free DNA in the
plasma is a dynamic and reliable biomarker of therapeutic response in BRAFV600E-mutant histiocytosis. Prelim-
inary data: More recently, a wide spectrum of genomic alterations in kinase signalling components were iden-
tified in BRAFV600E-wildtype (WT) histiocytic neoplasms. Diverse mutations in MEK1/2 and ARAF are among
the most common, accounting for >50% of BRAFV600 WT cases. Patients with BRAFV600-WT histiocytosis have
also been treated with MEK inhibition, both within a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT02649972) and in clinical prac-
tice. Knowledge gap: In contrast to the near-universal activity of BRAF inhibition for BRAFV600E-mutant histio-
cytosis, patients with BRAFV600-WT histiocytosis exhibit heterogeneity in their responses to MEK inhibition, the
basis of which remains unknown. Moreoever, many alterations in components of the MAPK pathway in histio-
cytoses have not been functionally characterized. The hypothesis of this study is that tumor cell-intrinsic ge-
netic alterations correlate with response to MEK inhibition in histiocytosis. This hypothesis will be tested by
evaluating therapeutic responses to MEK inhibition in our cohort of BRAFV600-WT histiocytosis patients with
diverse MAPK pathway mutations, and with innovative genomic analysis of plasma cell-free DNA to identify
biomarkers of response. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center is the leading referral center in the U.S. for
adults with histiocytosis—making it ideally suited to conduct this work. In parallel, the mechanistic and thera-
peutic implications of mutations in MEK1/2 and ARAF (which represent the most commonly mutated genes in
BRAFV600-WT patients) will be investigated. Although ARAF and MEK1/2 mutations are recurrent across many
cancers, the unique enrichment of these mutations in histiocytoses provides an opportunity to functionally dis-
sect mechanisms by which ARAF and MEK1/2 regulate MAPK signalling and drive cancer. Impact: This pro-
ject will improve our understanding of histiocytosis pathogenesis, mechanisms of MAPK pathway activation,
and determinants of response to MEK inhibition. Aim 1: Characterize the clinical and molecular response of
histiocytosis to MEK inhibition in a prospectively treated patient cohort, including an ongoing phase 2 clinical
trial. Aim 2. Understand the biochemical impact and therapeutic implications of MEK1/2 and ARAF mutations
in patients with histiocytoses."

Taxol is commonly used to treat TNBC and increasingly in combination with oral signal transduction inhibitors
(STIs), such as mTOR inhibitor (Afinitor) and MEK inhibitor (Koselugo), aiming for targeted therapies for this
genetically heterogeneous disease. However, while these drug combinations are active in TNBC, they are
associated with adverse effects, limiting clinical effectiveness. Our objective is to investigate oligo(lactic acid)
(o(LA)n-) prodrugs, part drug and part biomaterial, and poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(d,l-lactic acid) (PEG-b-
PLA) nanotechnology for the treatment of TNBC, focusing on concurrent delivery of drug combinations, including
delivery at synergistic drug ratios, termed ratiometric drug dosing. We will achieve this goal by developing a
scale-up approach for the controlled assembly of o(LA)n-prodrugs and PEG-b-PLA micelles that produces novel
nano-formulations for injection, characterized by high loading for a wide repertoire of chemotherapy and STIs,
fixed o(LA)n-prodrug ratios and slower release in comparison to drugs themselves. Next, ratiometric dosing of
o(LA)n-prodrug-loaded PEG-b-PLA micelles based on PTX, rapamycin (RAP) and selumetinib (SEL) will be
characterized in immunocompetent mouse models of TNBC, hypothesizing lower toxicity and higher antitumor
activity than Taxol, oral EVE and oral SEL. Mechanistically, we hypothesize that o(LA)n-prodrugs will prolong,
elevate and overlap tumor exposure for synergistic drug ratios in comparison to Taxol, oral EVE and oral SEL.
Further, o(LA)n-prodrug combinations may be potent immuno-modulators, which may be exploited for TNBC.
Given that PEG-b-PLA micelles satisfy strict requirements in safety, solubility and scale-up for injection and PEG-
b-PLA is readily available GMP-grade at varied molecular weights for adjustment of micelle stability in vivo,
o(LA)n-prodrugs have strong potential to improve the effectiveness of drug combinations based on PTX and
STIs, aimed at advancing TNBC therapies."

Classical aversive conditioning is a well-established laboratory model for studying acquisition and extinction of
defensive responses. In experimental animals, as well as in humans, research to date has been mainly focused
on the role of limbic structures (e.g., the amygdala) in these responses. Recent evidence has begun to stress
the important contribution by the brain’s sensory and attention control systems in maintaining the neural
representations of conditioned responses and in facilitating their extinction. The proposed research breaks new
ground by combining novel neuroimaging techniques with advanced computational methods to examine the
brain’s visual and attention processes underlying fear acquisition and extinction in humans. Major advances
will be made along three specific aims. In Aim 1, we characterize the brain network dynamics of visuocortical
threat bias formation, extinction, and recall in a two-day learning paradigm. In Aim 2, we establish and test a
computational model of threat bias generalization. In Aim 3, we examine the relation between individual
differences in generalization and recall of conditioned visuocortical threat biases and individual differences in
heightened autonomic reactivity to conditioned threat, a potential biomarker for assessing the predisposition to
developing the disorders of fear and anxiety. It is expected that accomplishing these research aims will address
two NIMH strategic priorities: defining the circuitry and brain networks underlying complex behaviors (Objective
1) and identifying and validating new targets for treatment that are derived from the understanding of disease
mechanisms (Objective 3). It is further expected that this project will enable a paradigm shift in research on
dysfunctional attention to threat from one that focuses primarily on limbic-prefrontal circuits to one that
emphasizes the interactions among sensory, attention, executive control and limbic systems."

The goal of our research program is to innovate the strategy and methodology of organic synthesis and use
these innovations to solve problems of biological and medicinal importance and ultimately impact human
health. Our program focuses on the synthesis and study of both natural and unnatural molecules with potential
for the treatment of cancer, neurological disorders, and drug resistant infectious diseases. We view the
completion of a chemical synthesis as the beginning of a larger and deeper scholarly inquiry. It would enable
us to profile the biology of the selected natural products and rationally designed small molecules, decipher their
mechanism of actions, and optimize the lead compounds into biological probes and novel therapeutics. The
selected terpenoid and alkaloid natural products represent both the state-of-the-art challenges for complex
molecule synthesis as well as promising lead compounds for novel therapeutic development. Their structural
complexity, natural scarcity, and unknown mechanism of actions have significantly hampered their biomedical
development. We aim to fill this gap and move these molecules forward in the drug discovery pipeline with a
multi-faceted approach centered on innovative chemical synthesis. The expected outcomes of this research
will provide (i) new reactions and strategies in the toolbox of both medicinal chemists and synthetic chemists to
prepare functional molecules, (ii) a reliable access to the selected target molecules with therapeutic
importance, (iii) a collection of medicinally relevant molecules featuring structural novelty, complexity, and
diversity for further and larger biological evaluations in academic institutions and pharmaceutical industries,
and (iv) novel anticancer, anti-neurodegenerative and antimicrobial lead compounds with potentially novel

Over the last 15 years, the Michigan Institute for Clinical & Health Research (MICHR) has supported a diverse
group of predoctoral PhD and professional degree trainees through programs that provide the foundation for
productive translational research and science careers. These trainees come to us from one of the University of
Michigan's (U-M) 11 Schools and Colleges (including Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Public Health, Nursing,
Social Work, Kinesiology, and Engineering), as well as numerous programs outside of U-M, including more
than 20 Historically Black Colleges & Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, or Tribal Colleges &
Universities as identified by the United States Department of Education. Program graduates have authored
more than 1500 scientific publications and lead research programs supported by $17.5M in extramural grant
support, with greater than 70% remaining engaged in science. MICHR's new T32 program is particularly strong
in its robust evaluation and adherence to foundational programmatic elements, which include competency-
based education, formal assessment of research skills, mentor training and regular mentor meetings, regular
use of individual development plans, and education in team science, scientific rigor, and the responsible
conduct of research. Our program is supported by an outstanding group of scientific mentors with more than
$99M in extramural funds, who welcome our T32 trainees into their highly successful multidisciplinary and
collaborative research programs. The MICHR T32 in translational science will recruit diverse cohorts of
trainees who are early in a health-related PhD program with support for two to three years, or professional
students wishing to take a year out from their education to receive translational science training. This new
program will build on the foundation set by our previous successful TL1 and leverage the unique strengths of
U-M to respond to evolving trainee needs and emerging trends in translational research and science. Broadly,
our T32 program's thematic areas of focus will fully integrate with MICHR's vision and thematic focus through
the following Aims: 1) Provide T32 trainees with precision preparation to further their translational research
skills; 2) strengthen the scientific social networks of T32 trainees to further their translational research pipeline
engagement; 3) develop T32 trainees who are versatile communicators to advance their evolving careers. The
expected outcomes of the MICHR predoctoral T32 in translational science will result in the implementation of
new training opportunities that democratize education and facilitate trainee pathways to independence by
providing flexible, personalized training options. Our new initiatives will strengthen our trainees' scientific social
networks for greater career development and enhance communication skills while also providing more

generation translational research and translational science team leaders."
10852975,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Somali women living in the U.S. have lower cervical cancer screening rates than the U.S. general female
population. This disparity is due to a range of factors, including limited awareness of HPV and cervical cancer,
cultural and religious beliefs, mistrust of health care providers, concerns around modesty and circumcision,
and low provider self-efficacy to perform Pap tests on circumcised women. HPV self-sampling is an emerging
cervical cancer screening modality that may address common screening barriers among Somali women,
particularly those related to modesty and circumcision. HPV self-sampling is accurate for detecting pre-
cancerous cervical lesions and effective in reaching underscreened women. In addition, our pilot work has
demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of HPV self-sampling in Somali women. While research has
focused primarily on home-based HPV self-sampling, there is an untapped opportunity to offer HPV self-
sampling in the primary care setting. Offering HPV self-sampling in primary care could effectively increase
cervical cancer screening rates in Somali women by positioning providers to address screening barriers,
enabling clinics to opportunistically fit in HPV self-sampling with other appointments, and providing an
alternative modality for circumcised women. We propose a Hybrid Type 2 effectiveness-implementation design
to assess the effectiveness and implementation of a patient-centered, culturally-tailored HPV self-sampling
intervention for Somali women. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science and Social
Cognitive Theory, we will conduct focus groups with Somali patients and interviews with providers to identify
patient-, provider-, clinic-, and systems-level factors to inform refinement of intervention materials and
development of implementation strategies (Aim 1). After tailoring the intervention, we will then implement HPV
self-sampling in 2 primary care clinics, and evaluate changes in Somali women’s cervical cancer screening
rates one-year pre and one-year post implementation (Aim 2). Changes will be compared with Somali women
attending 27 control clinics followed over the same time period, using difference-in-difference methods. Finally,
using RE-AIM, we will conduct a post-implementation mixed methods analysis of the processes and strategies
needed to successfully implement HPV self-sampling in primary care for Somali patients (Aim 3), including
interviews with providers and Somali women. Our hypothesis is that implementing HPV self-sampling in
primary care will lead to increased uptake of cervical cancer screening in Somali women and that an
implementation science based analysis of the processes needed to successfully implement the intervention will
lead to sustainable, novel strategies to support the sustained integration of HPV self-sampling into primary
care."

Significant disparities exist in health outcomes for rural and Black, Indigenous or people of color (BIPOC)
Americans. A contributing cause to these outcomes is the lack of diversity in translational researchers. To
enhance the translational science workforce, we have developed a summer research experience for
underrepresented undergraduate scholars who have previously completed a short program exposing them to
healthcare careers. Because the University of Iowa has a wide variety of research occurring across the
translational spectrum, extensive resources, and a unique role as the only academic medical center in a rural
state, we provide an ideal location for this training. The goals of our program are to provide 1) enhanced short-
term training in translational science, 2) mentoring of underrepresented future translational scientists, and 3)
focused education sessions related to clinical and translational science. To accomplish these goals, our
experiential educational opportunity for Beginning and Early Stage Translational (BEST) Researchers will
embed students in teams conducting translational research. Additionally, scholars will also participate in
educational experiences to provide them with foundational tools to progress to successful careers in
translational science. This will include seminars and activities related to bioethics, receiving mentorship,
wellness and resiliency, communication skills, advocacy for self-and others, application and interview tips,
responsible conduct of research, data management and analysis, and community participatory research. We
will utilize the Stanton-Salazar Social Capital Framework for helping scholars build strong relationships with
resources and support to advance them in the educational system. Further, our educational sessions will be
based on the backward curriculum design framework. This framework ensures that our goals for each session
are clearly delineated, and the activities are designed to support these goals. The Evaluation Program in the
Institute for Clinical and Translational Science at the University of Iowa will provide oversight that we are
achieving our goals and have continuous quality improvement. We will also evaluate the short and long-term
progress of the program’s scholars across several domains including improved domain skills, continued
participation in research, admission to graduate and professional programs, and submission and acceptance of
abstracts and manuscripts. In summary, there will be significant value in our program, and it will result in
improving diversity in the next generation of translational researchers which will ultimately contribute to our
efforts to reduce health disparities for rural and BIPOC populations."

While being an increasingly used option of reconstruction for severe defects arising from trauma and/or burn
injuries, VCA remains limited in use due to the complex ethical calculus of a treatment that improves life quality
dramatically, but at the cost of the side effects of long-term immunosuppression. In the longer term the most
promising approach is the induction of tolerance by mixed chimerism by bone-marrow co-transplantation. In the
shorter term, new strategies for monitoring immunosuppression to enable timely interventions, and reducing
immunogenicity of VCAs are necessary for making this treatment more accessible to patients in need. The
objective of this application is to develop a functional preservation platform that enables creating engineered
VCA grafts by exogenous administration of genetically-modified cells, their preservation in a clinically practicable
protocol, and testing the efficacy in reducing immunogenicity in rodent models of rejection and tolerance
induction. Biosensor cells will be genetically engineered with a transcription factor response element as a gene
promoter to serve as a theranostic, simultaneously driving the secretion of blood-based biomarker and a
therapeutic protein to attenuate a rejection response. We will combine this with our perfusion-based supercooled
preservation technologies to enable both engraftment of cells and to provide a time-window that makes the
utilization of engineered grafts viable in clinical time frames. This objective has been formulated based on our
prior work and preliminary results, where we have shown successful engineering of cells with required response
characteristics, development of an ex vivo rat limb perfusion system that can serve as a platform for engrafting
these cell biosensors into vascular grafts prior to transplant, and demonstrating that transducted cells can remain
viable in vivo for up to 4 months. The proposed work would lead to a smart-graft technology that can sensitively
measure local tissue signaling would enable practical monitoring and diagnosis of acute rejection episodes, can
transform care of transplant patients since compliance issues in medication would be dramatically reduced, and
will likely increase the overall efficacy and therefore reduce graft rejections. In the longer term, the preservation
methods developed here could also be enabling for tolerance induction in VCA transplants, and therefore allow
for their wide-spread use which is not possible currently."
10884167,"Accumulating evidence suggests that infections may play a major role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), however,
exact mechanism is unclear. Recent studies linked diverse microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, fungi) to AD-
related traits. This indicates a possibility that the culprit may be not a specific microbe (or not only it) but a
compromised host immunity that may increase brain vulnerability to various infections and related toxins. Recent
data (including our own) suggested that some vaccines may have broader than expected beneficial off-target
effects on the immunity that span beyond the protection against specific disease and may reduce risks of
seemingly unrelated disorders, including AD, as well as all-cause-mortality. The broad objective of this project is
to significantly improve our understanding of the connections between AD and infectious diseases and
suggest new candidates for AD prevention based on repurposing of existing vaccines in older adults.
To address this objective, we will assess the impact of infectious diseases and vaccinations occurring at ages
65+ on AD-related traits in population-based human data, taking into account genetic and other factors. This
study will employ advanced pseudo-randomization techniques (“proxy for clinical trials”) that take into account
multiple variables and bring the interpretation of study results closer to that seen in randomized clinical trials.
Specific Aims: Aim 1. Evaluate relationships between AD and common infectious diseases and vaccines
in older adults. We will estimate and compare risks of AD and other dementias among older individuals
diagnosed with herpes simplex, herpes zoster (shingles), bacterial pneumonia, flu, recurrent mycoses, and some
other infections. We will also evaluate off-target effects of vaccinations against pneumonia, flu, and shingles on
AD onset and survival to select promising candidate vaccines for repurposing for AD prevention. Aim 2. Evaluate
the impact of genes involved in AD and brain vulnerability to infections on associations of AD with
infections and vaccines. We will select candidate genes from the literature that are involved in AD, and BBB
permeability, brain response to infection, and myelin repair, and test if such genes can influence associations
between infections/vaccines and AD, or AD biomarkers, and may be used in personalized AD prevention, with
repurposed vaccines matching particular genotypes. Aim 3. Compare effects of infections, and vaccines, on
AD vs. other major diseases and all-cause mortality. We will evaluate and compare associations of infectious
diseases/vaccines with risks of AD and other diseases (cancer, CHD, stroke, diabetes), as well as all-cause
mortality, to check for potential trade-offs. Such trade-offs are important to identify for optimizing AD prevention
and avoiding the situation in which a protective factor for AD may have undesirable effect on other major
diseases, and/or survival. Results of this project will significantly improve our understanding of infectious etiology
of AD, and connections between AD and common infectious diseases, and will facilitate repurposing of existing
vaccines for AD prevention in older adults."
10831034,"Project Summary
Alcohol dependence and multiple withdrawal experiences are related to increased severity of alcohol use
disorder (AUD), craving, and resistance to treatment. Alcohol abuse gains control over behavior, in part, through
pathological adaptations of glutamatergic AMPA receptor (AMPAR) mechanisms that regulate synaptic and
behavioral plasticity in brain reward pathways. The unique auxiliary protein, transmembrane AMPAR regulatory
protein (TARP) γ-8, has been shown to regulate AMPAR trafficking, activity, and CaMKII-dependent plasticity,
making it critical for AMPAR mediated neural transmission. An important feature of TARP γ-8 is its highly
restricted expression limited to corticolimbic regions known to regulate glutamatergic response to alcohol
including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and the hippocampus, while
noticeably absent from the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Evidence indicates chronic alcohol increases glutamate
levels, which in turn promotes the influx of calcium, and initiating a cascade where CaMKII phosphorylates
AMPARs to increase and sustain AMPAR activity. Since AMPAR activity is required for the development of new
behavior (e.g., learning) and retention of actions (e.g., memory), this fundamental neural process may underlie
the development, maintenance, and critically, dependence-escalated self-administration of alcohol. Therefore,
this K99/R00 proposal will determine if TARP γ-8 regulates AMPAR mediated transmission in key brain regions
during dependence-escalated alcohol self-administration. Aim 1 (K99 phase) of the proposal will investigate the
role of TARP γ-8 dependent excitatory Ca2+ signaling in reward-related brain regions during alcohol self-
administration in the mPFC, BLA, NAc, and vHPC using a highly novel multi-spectral, four-channel fiber
photometry platform. Aim 2 (K99 phase) will examine TARP γ-8 as a mechanism of CIE vapor dependence-
induced escalation of alcohol self-administration and the consequential co-localization of TARP γ-8 and AMPAR
using confocal microscopy. Aim 3 (R00 phase) combines these techniques to evaluate Ca2+ signaling in key-
reward brain regions during dependence-escalated alcohol self-administration. These findings are then extended
by taking a circuit-based approach using a selective pharmacological manipulation in combination with fiber-
photometry to evaluate site-specific TARP γ-8 bound AMPAR inhibition on “bottom-up” (BLA to NAc) and “top-
down” (mPFC to NAc) Ca2+ signaling. This work moves the field forward by providing fundamental mechanistic
insights into TARP γ-8 dependence-escalated alcohol self-administration which has high translational value for
understanding and treating AUD and has the potential to inform development of new pharmacotherapeutic
strategies that target AMPAR function in a highly-selective brain region specific manner."

high priority areas of HIV research and SWG-targeted pilot project cycles, supplemented with generous
institutional funds provided by Baylor, UTHealth, and TxBiomed. Infrastructure provided by Core B will also
enable the D-CFAR to respond to NIH supplement opportunities. Developmental Core B will offer a uniquely
comprehensive and proactive mentoring program focused on junior investigators applying for pilot project
funding. A required Letter-of-Intent process will link junior investigators with a research mentor early in the pilot
project grant writing process. The mentoring program will then facilitate the assembly of a mentor team
consisting of three mentors—research, peer, and career—for each junior investigator applying for pilot project
funding. Innovative plans will extend mentoring from the pilot award through the first NIH grant. Developmental
Core B will sponsor an HIV Research Group meeting (HRGM) series, an AIDS Research Forum (ARF) series,
and a Workshop in HIV series. Core B will also sponsor an Annual Texas D-CFAR Conference where HIV
researchers throughout Texas will present their research, allowing investigators to receive critical input and
establish new collaborations."

Basic Science Core C will provide virology and immunology and nonhuman primate (NHP) resources and
services to facilitate high-priority HIV/AIDS research, particularly projects within the research theme of the
Texas D-CFAR: Ending HIV and Optimizing HIV Health in Texas. Based on a survey of anticipated D-
CFAR members, we expect the planned services to meet current needs and future directions of our
investigators. First, Core C will provide state-of the-art virology and immunology services, SIV/SHIV-macaque
resources, reagents, customized services, and experimental design support for D-CFAR investigators. Second,
Core C will support the Scientific Working Group on substance use by consulting on experimental approaches,
developing assays and providing resources for basic and translational research on the influence of substance
use on HIV disease. To further build capacity, a third major goal of the Core is to support high-priority D-CFAR
research initiatives that drive interdisciplinary research in opportunity areas and to support junior investigators
and investigators new to HIV research. To this end, Core C will offer training in virological and immunological
assays, instrumentation use, analysis, and biosafety for working with HIV and macaque tissues, and provide
facilities for HIV research. Core C will also develop new models, and offer access to new technologies and
resources of key interest to D-CFAR member investigators. Finally, Core C will collaborate with Clinical and
Biostatistics Core D and Developmental Core B to prioritize and support pilot projects of high interest. Core C
is led by three experienced HIV researchers with complementary expertise: Dr. Jason Kimata, whose interests
are in HIV molecular virology and cure research; Dr. Mahesh Mohan, who is an expert in SIV-macaque
models, mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, and substance use; Dr. Netanya Utay, who has expertise in
HIV clinical immunology, inflammation, and microbial translocation. They have collaborated with the D-CFAR
leadership team and have helped many others perform HIV-related research projects. They will be supervised
by an Oversight Committee. The Core Co-Directors will be responsible for day-to-day running of the
laboratories, ensuring that usage priorities are managed in a standard manner, and implementing a charge-
back system for services and resources. Successful execution of the Basic Science Core objectives will
facilitate the vision of cutting-edge HIV/AIDS research at Texas D-CFAR institutions and affiliates that will bring
an end to HIV in Texas and beyond."
10819156,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CLINICAL AND BIOSTATISTICS CORE D
The Texas Developmental Center for AIDS Research (D-CFAR) is based at Baylor College of Medicine
(Baylor) and University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) and the Texas Biomedical
Research Institute (TxBiomed) in San Antonio. A strategic planning process demonstrated need for clinical and
biostatitistical research support among both established and early stage investigators at the home institutions.
The Texas D-CFAR will therefore establish a Clinical and Biostatistics Core (CBC, Core D) to capiltalize on the
resources and expertise of HIV investigators and biostatisticians to facilitate high-impact clinical, translational
and basic science research aimed at Ending HIV and Optimizing HIV Health in Texas. The Core leadership
team has extensive experience in study design, clinical research, and research implementation, and data
management and analysis. It also is well connected with national biobanks and repositories and is thus
positioned to reach and support a diverse array of investigators. Texas D-CFAR investigators and affiliated
users, whether junior or new to HIV research or the participating institutions, may lack knowledge of how to
design, initiate and implement studies; how to obtain or access clinical samples or data; and/or how to design
and execute appropriate and reliable data management and analytic plans. The CBC goal is to fill that gap. To
do this, Core D will provide project development and implementation services for investigators who are junior
or new to HIV research or D-CFAR institutions; provide access to human tissue and blood samples, facilitating
clinical, translational and basic science research; and provide data analysis, data management and
consultative biostatistical services to investigators who are junior or new to HIV research or D-CFAR
institutions. The D-CFAR CBC will stimulate through mentorship and recruitment and facilitate through project
implementation high-impact research, meeting the current and anticipated clinical, translational and basic
science research and educational needs of local investigators, the NIH and our local communities of people
with and at risk for HIV. The Core leadership, in collaboration with the D-CFAR leadership, has identified a
comprehensive action plan, set of activities, policies and procedures and evaluation metrics to ensure success.
Through accomplishing our aims, we will move toward our goal of Ending HIV and Optimizing HIV Health in
Texas and be able to transition to full CFAR funding in 5 years."
10819160,"PROJECT SUMMARY - SUBSTANCE USE SCIENTIFIC WORKING GROUP
The Texas Developmental Center for AIDS Research (D-CFAR) is based at Baylor College of Medicine
(Baylor) and University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) and the Texas Biomedical
Research Institute (TxBiomed) in San Antonio. It will establish a Substance Use Scientific Working Group (SU-
SWG). Substance use trends in the state of Texas are similar to the nation as a whole in showing an increase
in opioid use and related emergency department visits and overdose deaths in recent years. Equally
concerning are recent trends in the use of methamphetamine, marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol. Substance use
and HIV are inextricably linked. Substance use is a well-established risk factor for transmission of the virus. For
people living with HIV, substance use and addiction can hasten the progression of HIV and its consequences.
Despite its significant impact on HIV, the intersection of substance use and HIV has been an underdeveloped
research area, especially in areas of the US with weaker substance use treatment infrastructures like Texas.
The proposed Texas D-CFAR SU-SWG will foster a robust research program in three areas that align with the
proposed D-CFAR to fill this gap: 1) substance use as a co-factor for transmission of HIV; 2) impact of
substance use on progression of HIV and its consequences; 3) novel treatment approaches for HIV prevention
and treatment for individuals who use substances. The SU-SWG will support research in these areas by
developing key resources, services, pilot funding opportunities, and by fostering discussions and collaborations
between Texas D-CFAR members. To achieve its goals, the SU-SWG will: 1) Work with the proposed Cores
and Core services to develop and support substance use as a critical area of research focus for ending HIV
and optimizing HIV health in Texas. 2) Inform the Texas D-CFAR community about ongoing and future
research on the intersection of substance use and HIV, both at our D-CFAR, nationally, and internationally. 3)
Inform the D-CFAR community about external funding opportunities on substance use, provide pilot project
funding opportunities through the Developmental Core, and catalyze collaborations. 4) Expand the SU-SWG
by opening membership to substance use and HIV researchers and trainees at other Texas institutions. To
achieve these aims, the D-CFAR has assembled a group of established and early stage investigators in both
HIV and substance use to bring together in the SU-SWG to foster research in the intersection of these two
epidemics. The SU-SWG includes persons with deep connections to the community and local public health
officials as well as academicians who have developed and lead innovative programs to deliver substance use
treatments. The SU-SWG leadership, in collaboration with the D-CFAR leadership, has identified a
comprehensive 5-year action plan, set of activities, policies and procedures and evaluation metrics to ensure
success. This activity organized by the SU-SWG will accelerate efforts to end HIV and improve the health of
people with HIV in Texas and beyond."

The investigators working together to form the Northern Ohio Alcohol Center (NOAC) are a group of world class
investigators from a broad range of disciplines spanning basic and clinical sciences, from chemistry and
biochemistry, metabolism and genetics, to clinical gastroenterology, hepatology and pathology. Our goal is to
continue to develop strong interdisciplinary collaborations between investigators in Northern Ohio that will lead
to advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathophysiology of alcohol-induced tissue
injury, with a particular, but not exclusive focus, on alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Because of our strong
translational and clinical expertise, we also focus on the translation of these basic mechanisms to clinical
practice. The Administrative Core of the NOAC will facilitate the accomplishment of these goals for research
and clinical practice through the following specific aims: 1) Encourage interactions between NOAC investigators,
Core Leaders and managers, as well as investigators and trainees in the Northern Ohio scientific community
with interests related to the thematic goals of the NOAC. The Administrative Core will facilitate these interactions
via the organization of enrichment and educational programs including monthly meetings and annual retreat of
the NOAC, as well as inviting world-renowned experts to visit NOAC as visiting scientists and providing travel
awards for trainees to attend the RSA annual meeting or Gordon Research Conference on Alcohol and End
Organ Injury, 2) Facilitate systems-wide integrated analysis of ethanol-induced tissue injury by providing early,
shared access to large data sets and bioinformatics support. 3) Provide oversight and enhance development of
resources for the activities of the NOAC by organizing meetings of the Steering Committee and Internal and
External Advisory Boards. 4) Manage the overall operating budget and prepare budget reports for Center grant
renewals and 5) Monitor progress of Research Components and Pilot Projects and assist with any management
issues. Accomplishment of these specific aims by the Administrative Core will speed the delivery of discoveries
towards the long-term goal of the NOAC to translate the novel findings of basic science regarding the specific
mechanisms by which ethanol disrupts cellular and organ function into effective treatment strategies for alcohol-
induced tissue injury."

Exposure to alcohol during development or adulthood may result in damage to the brain. Binge alcohol
consumption is a growing problem in the US, particularly among adolescents and young adults whose brains
are continuing to develop and are thus more susceptible to the harmful effects of binge drinking on brain function.
Both clinical and preclinical evidence suggest that microglia –the brain’s resident immune cells– play a key role
in modulating alcohol-induced neurotoxicity. Indeed, brain inflammation following alcohol binge can impair brain
development and function. In addition, activation of microglia promotes drinking preference in mouse models of
chronic alcohol exposure. However, the cellular or molecular mechanisms through which microglia could mediate
neuronal damage and alter animal behavior in response to alcohol in the adult or the adolescent brain have not
been identified. Moreover, the effects of alcohol on microglia-neuronal interactions at the structural or functional
level have not been studied, mostly due to technological limitations. We previously performed in vivo imaging
using two-photon microscopy and discovered the dynamic nature of microglia, providing the first real-time
demonstration of their tissue surveillance function. We also revealed their previously unknown ability to rapidly
respond to changes in their microenvironment. Following systemic inflammatory challenges microglia become
activated, and increase their interactions with the surrounding brain tissue. Acute and chronic alcohol exposure
increases pro-inflammatory cytokines systemically, which can in turn directly or indirectly affect blood-brain
barrier (BBB) integrity, and promote neuro-inflammatory and neurotoxic effects in different brain regions. Our
preliminary results in models of excessive ethanol exposure show microglial activation, BBB disruption, and
neuronal loss in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice, a brain region implicated in alcohol-induced impairments in
humans. Also, monocyte-specific deletion of MyD88, a key adaptor protein downstream of Toll-like receptor 4,
abrogated microglial activation, BBB damage, and neuronal loss following ethanol abuse, and prevented ethanol-
induced impairments in mice. Based on these findings, our proposed studies will test the hypotheses that
increasing ethanol exposure causes localized BBB damage and microglial activation, which is required for
regional structural and functional disruption of neuronal networks, and for alcohol-induced behavioral
impairments."
10817863,"ABSTRACT
Despite the high clinical significance of sarcopenia in alcohol-related liver disease, there are no effective
therapies because the mechanisms are not well understood. In the ongoing funding cycle, we identified that
kinase-independent dephosphorylation of critical signaling molecules in the skeletal muscle resulted in reduced
protein synthesis and increased autophagy mediated proteolysis. Ethanol increased the activity of protein
phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that caused targeted inactivation of mTOR and AMPK, critical signaling molecules
regulating muscle protein homeostasis (proteostasis). We also observed that ethanol inhibited the lipid- and
protein-kinase activities of gamma isoform of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K), a known inhibitor of PP2A. The
downstream signaling responses to ethanol-mediated increased PP2A activity was the simultaneous inhibition
both AMPK and mTOR, that have opposing effects on protein synthesis and autophagic proteolysis but the
functional consequences were due to impaired mTORC1 signaling responses. Since loss of AMPK occurs in a
fed state while mTORC1 is inhibited during fasting, we call the ethanol mediated signaling perturbations to reflect
a pseudofed state. Since mTORC1 and AMPK are also responsive to cellular energy deficiency and ethanol
causes mitochondrial dysfunction, we evaluated and reported that ethanol impaired mitochondrial function and
increased the generation of free radicals in the skeletal muscle that contributed to the signaling perturbations
and sarcopenic phenotype. Specifically, complex IV in the electron transport chain was impaired with potential
impairment of upstream complexes I and III. Whether ethanol impairs these complexes directly or due to the free
radicals generated is not known. Determining the mechanism by which ethanol impairs the specific complexes
in the electron transport chain and the functional consequences are also not known. Finally, in the ongoing
studies, we are studying the effect of L-leucine on restoring muscle proteostasis and reversing sarcopenia in
human patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. However, a large amino acid load increases the nitrogen load and cause
hyperammonemia and consequent adverse effects. In preclinical studies in ethanol-treated myotubes and
ethanol-fed mice, we noted that -hydroxymethyl butyrate (HMB), a leucine metabolite with anabolic properties,
reversed ethanol impaired protein synthesis and reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Based on these
preliminary data, we hypothesize that ethanol-induced dysregulation in proteostasis and mitochondrial
dysfunction underlies sarcopenia. In the renewal cycle, we propose to dissect the molecular mechanisms of
inactivation of PI3K and increased PP2A activity using loss and gain of function studies in preclinical models.
We will dissect the specific defects in mitochondrial function using a combination of functional assays and studies
to determine the assembly of the electron transport chain components into supercomplexes. Finally, we will test
the translational significance of our mechanistic studies by testing if HMB can reverse the muscle perturbations
in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis."

 Dynamic mRNA modiﬁcations, such as the m6A-dependent regulation at the mRNA level, add a
critical new dimension to post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The rapid development
of sequencing technologies has transformed the ﬁeld of epitranscriptomics studies by resulting in the
successful proﬁling transcriptome-wide RNA modiﬁcations under different states and conditions. They
hold the promise to reveal regulatory machinery of RNA modiﬁcations, which contributes to almost
every phase of mRNA metabolism and function, thereby impacting diverse biological processes. How-
ever, analytical developments in epitranscriptomics lag far behind the pace of technological discovery,
and the bioinformatic infrastructure available for epitranscriptomic studies remains limited. The overar-
ching goal of this proposal is to address three most pressing challenges facing proﬁling and interpreting
epitranscriptomics. Speciﬁcally, we will achieve the following aims: Aim1. Develop statistical methods
for RNA modiﬁcation detection at single nucleotide resolution. Aim 2. Develop computational meth-
ods for cell type-speciﬁc methylation analysis. Aim 3. Develop web servers that enable integrating
RNA modiﬁcation with a rich catalog of genomics features. All the methods will be implemented in
user-friendly software and disseminated to the scientiﬁc community. Successful achievement of all
aims will dramatically increase the power of epitranscriptomes analysis, leading to better understand-
ing of regulatory mechanisms in RNA modiﬁcations and their implications in phenotypes and human
diseases."

The impaired glycemic control associated with pre-diabetes increases risk for type 2 diabetes, which is a
known risk factor for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Mechanisms such as impaired energy metabolism, cellular
bioenergetic function, reduced intracellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis), and inflammation are all
potential contributors to AD etiology. Therefore, a novel therapy that simultaneously improves glycemic control
and cellular chaperone systems (i.e. Heat Shock Proteins, HSPs) may prove particularly effective in preventing
and treating AD. Heat therapy has been independently shown to improve blood glucose regulation, insulin
resistance, and inflammation. Importantly, heat therapy also activates inter-organ crosstalk via endocytic
vesicles and increases HSPs to improve both mitochondrial function and proteostasis in a variety of tissues.
Given the potential contribution of these factors to brain health, heat therapy could offer immense clinical
benefit to individuals at risk for AD. Here, we will determine if heat therapy can improve blood (Aim 1) and brain
(Aim 2) glucose metabolism in cognitively healthy older adults (65+) who are at risk for AD. We will also
examine the degree to which changes in blood and brain glucose metabolism track together and explore
several additional potential mechanisms that are critical to understanding the brain benefits of heat therapy
(Aim 3). These aims will provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of heat therapy on glucose
homeostasis and brain health."

10854736,"Abstract
B lymphocytes in the gastrointestinal tract are constantly stimulated by commensals microbial antigens. In order to
prevent commensal outgrowth and maintain intestinal homeostasis, B cells need to mount a rapid antibody response
against bacterial antigens.
To achieve this task, the humoral immune system relies on a complex multistep process of B cell proliferation and
selection in the germinal center, which eventually gives rise to either antibody secreting plasma cells or memory B cells.
Intestinal B cells are also exposed to dietary and microbial metabolites during their activation and differentiation, but
how these environmental cues shape B cell fate and antibody response in the gut is poorly understood.
Therefore, elucidating the fundamental mechanisms that intrinsically regulate the fate and function of individual B cell
clones in the gut remains a central question in immunology.
Several lines of evidence indicate that metabolic switches act as intrinsic regulators of germinal center B cell response.
However, how B cells integrate metabolite sensing with germinal center and antibody response remains undefined to
date.
In this application we test the hypothesis that the oxysterol 25-HC, an oxidized form of cholesterol, directly controls
germinal center B cell response through its interaction with the Sterol Response Element Binding Protein 2 (SREBP2).
SREBP2 is a key regulator of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, and its transcriptional activity in the intestinal
germinal center B cells couples lipid metabolism and B cell differentiation in the intestine. We also hypothesize that
follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), stromal cells which are located in the germinal center, produce 25-HC in response to
dietary cholesterol and microbiome, therefore linking rapidly changing intestinal homeostasis to B cell fate.
Accumulating evidence indicates that 25-HC controls SREBP2 processing, but the implication for this cross talk in B
cells in the gut has not been investigated so far.
Our aims are: 1) To test the hypothesis that SREBP2 activity controls germinal center B cell transcriptional profile and
B cell fate; and 2) To define the environmental and cellular cues that regulate 25-HC niche.
The proposed studies examine a very poorly understood crosstalk between oxidized form of cholesterol, intestinal
metabolism and adaptive immune system activation. It is our expectation that these studies will increase our
understanding of how intestinal metabolism shapes B cell responses and adaptive immunity. Furthermore, these studies
will provide a foundation for better understanding of the relationship between lipid metabolism and differentiation in
immune cells."
10853012,"Summary
Mycobacterium abscessus (MAB) is a nontuberculous mycobacterium that causes chronic pulmonary infections
(pMAB) and patients with pre-existing lung disease (especially cystic fibrosis patients) have a predisposition to
pMAB. Due to MAB’s intrinsic antibiotic resistance, treatment is often complex and with low cure rates.
Tigecycline, a glycylcycline class antibiotic, demonstrates bactericidal effects against pMAB without eliciting
bacterial resistance mechanisms. For pMAB treatment, patients receive twice daily intravenous administration
of tigecycline during at least one month resulting in significant side effects and many patients withdraw from
treatment. Tigecycline has the potential to qualify as the first-line agent during therapy for pMAB and the
backbone for new combination regimens but to achieve its fullest therapeutic potential, we need to improve
tigecyclines ratio between efficacy and safety/tolerability, i.e. its therapeutic index. One approach to address this
challenge is to develop inhalational formulations of tigecycline that are easy to administer and are well
tolerated. In preliminary studies, GM-CSF KO mice with pMAB were treated by intrapulmonary aerosols of
tigecycline for 28 days. The pulmonary bacterial burden after full treatment duration showed that inhaled
tigecycline has high, dose-dependent efficacy, and is well tolerated. Here we hypothesize that aerosol delivery
of tigecycline is a viable therapeutic approach for pMAB. In Aim 1, to avoid the tigecycline requirements for
reconstitution, we will develop a dry powder formulation of tigecycline with well characterized aerodynamic
properties suitable for inhalation. Aim 2 will study the relationship between dose, dosing regimen and resulting
exposure of aerosols of tigecycline in different body fluids, organs and tissues. In particular, we will study the
dose-exposure relationship of inhaled versus intravenous tigecycline and its availability in plasma, lung,
abscesses and epithelial lining fluid. In Aim 3, we propose to test the efficacy, dose, dosing frequency, and
duration of inhaled tigecycline against pMAB using animal models. We propose using first the GM-CSF KO
murine model, subsequently, we will test the best regimen in b-ENac Tg mice with pMAB infection, as a
representative model for cystic fibrosis patients. The best regimen will be validated in mice infected with selected
clinical isolates from MAB clones 1 and 2 and isolates obtained from cystic fibrosis patients. Aim 4 will
determine efficacy of inhaled tigecycline in multidrug therapies. Mice with pMAB as in Aim 3 (with strain
#21 or clinical isolates) will be treated with binary or ternary combinations of inhaled tigecycline and
clarithromycin (oral), clofazimine (oral), bedaquiline (oral). These studies will be performed by a consortium of
experts located at Colorado State University, University of Tennessee, Research Triangle Institute and National
Jewish Hospital. Working together, we aim to provide an inhalational therapy regimen of tigecycline with well-
defined aerodynamic and PK properties and well characterized in vivo efficacy for future preclinical toxicology
studies in larger animal models, IND application, and ultimately administration to patients."
10975439,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid overdose death (OOD) rates in the among Black individuals in the U.S. have increased unabated since
2015, outpacing those of White individuals at a rate of two to one. Racial disparities in the growth rate of OOD
have been documented in at least 23 states, including Missouri, which has second highest rate of OOD among
Black individuals: 44 per 100,000 (relative to 16 per 100,000 nationally). There is a critical need to identify and
mitigate social determinants of health (SDOH) that drive increasing racial inequities in OOD and opioid use
disorder treatment utilization. One strategy that addresses SDOH—such as low geographic access to
treatment and high neighborhood deprivation—is community-based outreach, which dispatches peers and
community health workers to provide harm reduction tools and linkages to evidence-based treatment. Although
outreach efforts improve psychoeducation and access to treatment for Black people who use opioids, existing
efforts are limited by a lack of data-driven targets. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify and disseminate
geographic and structural drivers of OOD among Black individuals to improve the efficacy of existing outreach
interventions and in turn, improve treatment access. The current K08 proposal addresses this need by
integrating geospatial information systems (GIS) technology and community based participatory research to
create a digital tool designed to 1) identify current SDOH that underlie OOD among Black individuals and 2)
provide data-driven targets to improve the efficacy of community-based outreach interventions. The project
aims and career development plan will concurrently support Dr. Banks’ transition to an independent clinical
investigator focused on the integration of technology and community engagement to improve substance use
treatment among minoritized racial/ethnic groups. Specific aims of the project are to 1) develop and evaluate
the predictive validity of a GIS-enabled index (the “Overdose Racial Equity Index”) to model risk for OOD
among Black individuals based on SDOH identified and rated by community experts and 2) demonstrate initial
acceptability and utility of the Overdose Racial Equity Index to guide outreach interventions for Black OOD via
focus groups with peers and community health workers. Aims and related training opportunities facilitated by
the rich intellectual environment of the University of Missouri—St. Louis and the two other research institutions
in St. Louis will support Dr. Banks’ training goals to gain expertise in digital/mobile health therapeutics, opioid
use disorder treatment, and implementation science. Outcomes include the identification of SDOH that underlie
OOD among Black Americans and a research and replicable implementation model for other regions to identify
policy and intervention targets that reduce the disproportionate burden of OOD among Black Americans. The
research will provide the training and data necessary for an R01 application that tests the effectiveness of a
mobile version of the Overdose Racial Equity Index to improve community-based prevention outcomes."
10840438,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Black Americans experience a disproportionate burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Studies have identified midlife (~ ages 45-65)
dyslipidemia as a risk factor for ADRD. Black Americans have more favorable lipid profiles compared to Whites
or Latinos, but their incidence of dyslipidemia in midlife is higher. This seemingly paradoxical relationship
between favorable midlife lipid profiles yet high incidence of midlife dyslipidemia and high risk of ADRD among
Black Americans has been severely understudied. Lipids play a vital role in neurodegenerative disease, and
epidemiologic and metabolomic studies have identified commonly tested lipids (total cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) as well as sphingolipids (ceramides) as predictors of cognitive
aging. Prior work has largely overlooked the contributions of lipids to ADRD risk in Black Americans and few
studies have examined the relationship of ceramides with cognitive aging and ADRD in this high-risk group.
This project will leverage over 40 years of longitudinal data from two NIH/NIA funded cohort studies, the Kaiser
Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences (KHANDLE) Study and the Study of Health Aging in African
Americans (STAR), to better understand the role of lipids in cognitive aging and ADRD among Black
Americans. The scientific objective of this research plan is to characterize the relationship of early adulthood (~
age 30) total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides as well as the novel lipid
biomarker, ceramides, with late life cognitive decline, ADRD, and MRI markers of neurodegeneration and
vascular brain injury in an all-Black cohort of older adults. The proposed research seeks to: 1) define the role of
early adulthood lipids in cognitive aging and ADRD; 2) examine genetic (APOE) and psychosocial (racism)
factors as potential effect modifiers; and 3) determine whether the relationship of early adulthood lipid levels
with late life cognitive decline and ADRD is partially mediated by midlife (~ ages 45-65) cardiometabolic
disease (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia). For aging Black Americans with high prevalence
of CVD risk factors and at disproportionate risk of dementia, prevention of ADRD has enormous health and
economic consequences. This research will be complimented by a detailed training plan based at the
University of California, Davis, with guidance from an exceptional mentorship team of nationally and
internationally recognized ADRD, lipids, dementia, and cognitive aging researchers. The training will build upon
the applicant's background in CVD and dementia epidemiology by incorporating specialized training in
lifecourse theory and modern causal inference methods, biology of lipids, psychometric testing, and
measurement and modeling of neuroimaging biomarkers. The combined research and training will prepare the
applicant to successfully transition to an independent researcher of disparities in vascular contributions to
ADRD."
10836438,"Physical activity promotion among youth is critical for cardiovascular disease prevention. Despite available
evidence-based approaches for physical activity, implementation remains a challenge, especially in schools.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective implementation strategies to improve the dissemination
and implementation of evidence based physical activity approaches for children. The purpose of this four year
K01 award is to prepare Dr. Timothy J. Walker with the training and experience necessary to achieve his career
goals of becoming an independent investigator and leader in the field of implementation science and physical
activity promotion. This proposal includes three training objectives: 1) gain proficiency in implementation
research; 2) build analytic skills to use multilevel models and Bayesian statistical approaches in
implementation research; and 3) increase competency in conducting school-based physical activity research.
Dr. Walker has assembled a mentorship team of experts in implementation science (Dr. Maria Fernandez,
primary mentor), applied statistical methods (Dr. Charles Green, co-mentor), and physical activity research
(Drs. Harold Kohl and John Bartholomew, co-mentors). The proposed study sets out to improve the
implementation of active learning, which is a school-based evidence-based approach that incorporates physical
movement into academic lessons. The study rationale is that active learning approaches are effective for
increasing children's physical activity, yet there are large gaps in research about their implementation in
practice. The study aims are: 1) develop an implementation strategy to improve the use and sustainment of
active learning approaches in elementary schools and 2) conduct a feasibility study to evaluate the impact of
the developed implementation strategy on the implementation and effectiveness of active learning. Aim 1 will
use Intervention Mapping, a systematic approach to develop a scientifically-based multifaceted
implementation strategy. Aim 2 will use a quasi-experimental design to examine acceptability of the
implementation strategy and its impact on implementation fidelity. Aim 2 will also examine the preliminary
effectiveness of active learning. This study is highly significant because it addresses physical inactivity among
children in schools where there is an urgent need for implementation support. If effective, the developed
implementation strategy has the potential to improve the use of active learning and reach millions of students
across the US. The study is innovative because it targets a novel approach for active learning where there is
limited research about implementation strategies to support the use of such approaches. It also uses a novel
framework to guide implementation strategy development, and Bayesian statistical methods to determine
whether the implementation strategy warrants further testing. Results from this study will enhance the ability
to scale-up physical activity approaches in schools. Data will also be used to pursue R01 funding for a larger
scale trial, which will further support Dr. Walker's transition to research independence."

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal fibrotic lung disease that is incurable and progressive due to
fibroblast activation, and the formation of scar tissue. Approximately 130,000 Americans suffer from IPF, with
an estimated 50,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Although it is well accepted that myofibroblast
accumulation is a central component of pathogenesis in IPF, the transcriptional program(s) that orchestrate
fibroblast activation including fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transformation (FMT), survival, migration and ECM
organization are poorly defined and represent a significant knowledge gap in the field. Sox9 is a member of the
HMG-box family of transcription factors that are selectively expressed by epithelial progenitor cells to modulate
branching morphogenesis in the lung and the organized deposition of collagen as part of cartilage formation in
multiple organs. However, the role of Sox9 in fibroblast activation has been poorly studied in adult fibrotic lung
diseases. Our new findings have determined that Sox9 is upregulated in lung mesenchymal cells of IPF and
functions as a positive regulator of FMT, myofibroblast survival, migration and ECM production. The loss of
Sox9 expression has attenuated αSMA expression and myofibroblast transformation in mesenchymal cells
isolated from IPF lungs and TGFα model. In support, a recent published study suggest Sox9 upregulation in
patients with chronic liver disease that correlated with fibrosis severity and progression towards cirrhosis.
Taken together, these findings lead us to postulate that Sox9 functions as a positive regulator of FMT,
myofibroblast survival, migration, and ECM in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. For this study,
we propose three specific aims: 1) determine mechanisms by which Sox9 induces fibroblast activation; 2)
establish in vivo the role of Sox9-expressing mesenchymal cells in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis; and
3) identify mechanisms by which Sox9 augments myofibroblast survival and the progression of established and
ongoing pulmonary fibrosis. We will use advanced molecular methods and mouse transgenic approaches,
coupled with detailed biochemical analysis of these Sox9-driven processes in vivo and in vitro. Completion of
the proposed experiments is likely to impart a significant understanding of Sox9-driven fibroblast activation.
The multidisciplinary team will facilitate a timely approach with expertise in all aspects of lung pathology and
support future translational studies in IPF. Our approach is innovative due to the generation of novel transgenic
mice to test mesenchymal cell-specific functions of Sox9 in pulmonary fibrosis. The proposed research is
significant in that completion of this study will increase an understanding of the mechanisms causing fibroblast
activation in IPF, which in turn will lead to advanced medical therapies for the treatment and possible cure or
prevention of this debilitating lung disease."

10860958,"Abstract
 Eukaryotic genomes encode genetic information in their linear sequence, but appropriate expression of
their genes requires chromosomes to fold into complex and spatially distinct three-dimensional structures.
Recent advances in genomic-based approaches have uncovered a hierarchy of DNA interactions, from small
chromatin loops that connect genes and enhancers to larger chromosomal domains and nuclear
compartments. However, despite the remarkable conservation of these organizational features and their
impact on gene function, we have a very limited understanding of how chromosomes are spatially partitioned,
functionally packaged, and relatively positioned in the nucleus. Technical limitations have also hindered our
ability to ask questions regarding cell-to-cell variability and the relationship between chromatin folding,
positioning, and function at single cell resolution.
 Our previous studies involved the development of two technologies that use fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH) to interrogate chromosome positioning at single-cell resolution. Our goal is to build on this
work and use these tools to elucidate how chromosomal segments find each other and then form stable
interactions within cells. To this end, we have developed a rapid and precise method for identifying candidates
involved in chromosome interactions. We now propose to employ this technology to isolate novel architectural
proteins, which will be followed by a battery of genomic and in situ-based assays to characterize the
candidates. Collectively, the studies proposed here will uncover novel molecular mechanisms underlying
nuclear organization, providing a new avenue to study how chromatin folding and positioning is established
and inherited, and how dysfunctional organization contributes to disease."
10827856,"ABSTRACT: Respiratory infections with viruses and fungi constitute major public health problems globally.
Except for influenza virus, there are no licensed vaccines against viruses or fungi. It is generally agreed that
induction of T-cell memory is critical for defense against viruses and fungi in the respiratory tract. We and others
have shown that induction of tissue-resident memory (TRM) CD8 and CD4 T cells and systemic migratory memory
CD4 T cells are essential for protection against influenza A virus (IAV) and inhaled fungi, respectively. However,
both TRM cells and systemic memory CD4 T cells undergo attrition, leading to short-lived immunity, which is
especially true for TC1/TH1 cells. Therefore, induction of durable T-cell immunity poses major challenges for
vaccinologists. As compared to TH1 cells, TH17 cells display sought-after attributes of stem-ness, durability and
functional plasticity. We propose to tailor combination adjuvants to harness T17 programming and induce durable
and protective lung TRM cells and migratory memory CD4 T cells against viruses and fungi.
 We find that Adjuplex, a nano-emulsion adjuvant, when combined with the TLR4 agonist glucopyranosyl
lipid A (GLA), evokes antigen-specific CD8 and CD4 T-cell responses in the lung that are: (i) durable and
multifaceted (TC1/TC17/TH1/TH17), and (ii) confer heterosubtypic immunity against IAV that persists >400 days.
We further find that combining those adjuvants with fungal CLR ligands Blastomyces endoglucanase 2 (Bl-Eng2;
Dectin-2 agonist) and b-glucan particles (Dectin-1 agonist) augments antiviral TC17/TH17/TC1/TH1 and elicits
migratory memory T cells that protect against fungal pneumonia. By single-cell RNAseq, we found that our
combined adjuvants induce memory antiviral and antifungal CD8 and CD4 T-cell clusters that express ICOS
(Inducible T Cell Co-stimulator), the transcription factor c-Maf, and a transcriptome that fosters tissue residency,
stem cell-ness and non-pathogenic T17 programming. Cyclic dinucleotides also promote T17 programming in
lungs. This, we postulate that programming stem cell-like, functionally plastic, non-pathogenic TC17/TH17
memory cells with our combination adjuvants (that engage TLR-4, Dectin-1/2 and STING pathways) will foster
durable protective immunity to viral and fungal pathogens in the lung. Our specific aims will test three
hypotheses: Aim 1: Combination adjuvants that evoke TC17/TH17 stem cell-like functionally-plastic TRM or
systemic migratory memory will engender durable immunity to respiratory viral and fungal pathogens; Aim 2:
Functional plasticity of TC17/TH17 memory is important for protective immunity to viruses and fungi; Aim 3: The
ICOS/c-Maf pathway is integral to establishment and/or maintenance of durable vaccine-induced protective
immunity to respiratory viral and fungal infections. The proposed work is significant and of high impact because
it has the potential to create a tractable adjuvant system/tool kit that will advance the formulation of vaccines: (i)
targeted for mucosal or parenteral administration; (ii) designed to induce TRM or systemic T-cell memory; and (iii)
tailored to elicit CD8 and CD4 T cells that protect against diverse pathogens such as viruses and fungi."
10833066,"Epilepsy is a major economic and personal burden for the American public, affecting over 3 million
Americans (1-2% of the population) with over 200,000 new cases diagnosed each year. There is no cure for
epilepsy. Seizures can only be suppressed using antiepileptic drugs. Unfortunately, these drugs are ineffective
in approximately 30% of patients and are often associated with adverse side effects.
 T-type calcium channels (T-channels) play an important role in controlling neuronal excitability. T-
channels open near the resting membrane potential of many neurons, allowing them to act as pacemaker
currents that trigger sodium dependent action potential. Increases in T-channel expression and activity have
been reported in animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), contributing to neuronal hyperexcitability. In
absence epilepsy, T-channel activity has been linked to thalamocortical network oscillations that give rise to
spike wave discharges (SWD). Despite growing evidence for a role of T-channels in both TLE and absence
epilepsy, little is known about the mechanisms by which T-channel activity and expression levels are increased,
facilitating increases in neuronal excitability and seizure susceptibility. We recently discovered a novel T-channel
modulator, the Ca2+ channel and chemotaxis receptor domain containing 1 (CACHD1) protein. CACHD1 is
structurally similar to 2 subunits, the major target of gabapentinoids. CACHD1 is highly expressed in both
human and rodent hippocampal and thalamic brain regions with overlapping expression patterns to all three T-
channel subtypes. CACHD1 promotes cell surface expression levels of T-channels and increases peak current
densities, leading to an increase in neuronal excitability and increased seizure susceptibility. Knockout of
CACHD1 prevents γ-butyrolactone (GBL) induced absence seizures and delays the onset of kindled seizures
and reduces seizure durations. In view of these findings, CACHD1 could facilitate increases in neuronal
excitability associated with TLE and absence epilepsy, making it a novel target for therapy. In this proposal we
will test our central hypothesis that CACHD1 increases neuronal excitability via increases in T-channel
function, facilitating the onset and severity of both absence epilepsy and TLE. On completion of these
studies we will have advanced our current understanding for the role of CACHD1 in the development of absence
epilepsy and TLE, providing a novel target for therapy development."
10833061,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Febrile seizures are the most common form of childhood seizures. They affect 2-5% of children
between the ages of 6 and 60 months. They occur with a rise in body temperature that is often
associated with a fever, though the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In a subset of
children with febrile seizure, seizures and convulsions are prolonged and are referred to as febrile
status epilepticus (fSE). Some children that experience fSE go on to develop epilepsy in childhood or
adulthood making childhood fSE a risk factor for subsequently developing epilepsy. Although the
underlying mechanisms governing status epilepticus and epilepsy are known to emanate from
neuronal dysfunction, compelling research in recent years suggest contributions from inflammation,
broadly characterized, in fSE. This is evidenced by increased inflammatory mediators in fSE and
reduced SE with broad-acting anti-inflammatory drugs. However, inflammation, can be generated by
resident cells of the brain such as microglia and astrocytes as well as peripheral immune cells that
can release inflammatory mediators outside the brain to alter neuronal function. Current research has
thus far failed to delineate cell-specific contributions to inflammation in the context of fSE. In this
project, we have begun to determine distinct contributions from microglia, the primary resident
immune cell of the brain, in fSE. Given broadly detrimental roles for inflammation in fSE, it has been
assumed that microglia, as inflammation-competent cells, promote fSE. Contrary to this assumption,
our preliminary experimental results in both chemical- and hyperthermia- induced SE, indicate that
microglia actually play beneficial roles in reducing SE severity in mouse models. Moreover, we have
identified the microglial-specific P2Y12R as a candidate regulator of microglial beneficial contributions
during experimental SE. Therefore, using well-established microglial elimination approaches, we will
now: (1) test for general microglial roles in hyperthermia-induced SE and determine whether
microglial regulate the neuroinflammatory environment in SE (Aim 1); (2) test for specific microglial
P2Y12R roles in regulating microglial beneficial contributions to controlling hyperthermia-induced SE
(Aim 2); and (3) determine microglial P2Y12R roles in the progression to temporal lobe epilepsy
(TLE) using a novel mouse model follow early life exposure to hyperthermia-induced SE (Aim 3). This
project is a first to adequately clarify microglial contributions in a mouse model of fSE as a pre-clinical
model. This work will provide a framework for targeting microglia as a novel approach to ameliorate
SE in general and fSE in particular."
10847392,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A diverse educational and scientific community including people with different life experiences, cultural
backgrounds, and ethnicities is vital for developing a robust workforce that can address the technological and
social challenges of the U.S. in a new global and interconnected economy. Unfortunately, there is tremendous
disparity in the U.S. scientific community in which individuals from disadvantaged economic and social
backgrounds, with disabilities, and from some ethnic groups (i.e., African, Native, and Latino Americans) are
underrepresented and therefore unable to contribute their talents. Therefore, a forceful approach should be
developed to correct the lack of diversity within the scientific community. A starting point for this approach is at
colleges and universities where students from underserved communities that do not have the same resources
to support higher education begin their education. Indeed, the socio-economic reality of underprivileged
students is likely to negatively impact their interest in research. To overcome the obstacles of preventing the
pursuit of scientific careers, we are proposing the establishment of a “Maximizing Access to Research Careers”
(MARC) program at UC San Diego with the mission is to unlock the potential of students from
underrepresented ethnic groups in science, from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds and students
with disabilities. The proposed MARC program is directed at motivating, training, mentoring, and facilitating the
transition of undergraduate students from college to a Ph.D. program. This new MARC program at UC San
Diego will be built on the success of 14 years of experience obtained from an undergraduate “Initiative for
Maximizing Student Development” (IMSD) program. The proposed MARC program is composed of two
consecutive phases to accomplish our goals. An initial Pre-MARC “Boot Camp” training where students
acquire the fundamental scientific skills to be successful in research activities (Phase 1), which is followed by
immersing scholars into a rich scientific environment by participating in a research project under the
supervision and mentorship of internationally recognized, productive, and well-funded investigators with
outstanding training records (Phase 2). In this setting, trainees enhance their initial scientific training by gaining
expertise in experimental planning, time management, data collection, interpretation, reproducibility,
presentations, and ethics, with the final goal of enrolling in a Ph.D. program. These phases will be
accompanied by leadership and career development training to increase students’ self-identity and self-efficacy
as scientists, thus supporting their pursuit of a research career."
11081969,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common cause of premature death among people living with HIV (PLWH), and
effective TB prevention and treatment strategies are critical for preventing TB-related deaths in PLWH. Treat-
ment of active TB requires the daily intake of multiple drugs for at least 6 months. Although a promising regimen
for TB preventive therapy (TPT) requires only one month of daily drugs (isoniazid and rifapentine or “1HP”),
current World Health Organization (WHO) approved regimens require 4-9 months of daily treatment, and for
PLWH in high TB burden settings, continuous TPT (≥36 months) is recommended. There is clear evidence that
shorter regimens are as associated with higher completion rates and, for both TPT and active TB, failure to
complete therapy decreases treatment efficacy. The use of long-acting injectable (LAI) drug formulations may
simplify regimens for TB prevention and treatment and increase completion rates by reducing the burdens, both
for individual patients and for public health systems, associated with months to years of daily pill intake. Recently,
an LAI formulation of the diarylquinoline (DARQ) bedaquiline demonstrated superior bactericidal activity to a
WHO-approved regimen (rifampin monotherapy) in a validated mouse model of TPT. The next generation
DARQs TBAJ-876 and TBAJ-587, now in phase 1 trials as oral drugs, are more potent against Mycobacterium
tuberculosis in mouse models of active TB treatment and have physiochemical properties highly amenable to
LAI formulation. The objective of this milestone-driven R61/R33 project is to develop LAI formulations of
a next-generation DARQ for TPT and DARQ co-formulated with a companion agent (pretomanid,
delamanid, and/or rifabutin), for use during the continuation phase of active TB treatment. In the R61
phase, research will focus on development and selection of optimized LAI formulations of a next-generation
DARQ and/or a combination of a DARQ plus companion agent, physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling
and non-clinical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies to predict efficacious doses and testing proof-of-
concept in a validated mouse model of TPT and a well-characterized mouse model of active TB treatment. In
the R33 phase, research will focus on investigational new drug (IND)-enabling non-clinical characterization of
1-2 LAI formulations developed and selected in the R61 phase, including injection site safety and tolerability,
and relevant chemistry, manufacturing, and control issues, including heat stability. In addition, advanced non-
clinical efficacy testing will be conducted in mouse models of TPT and active TB treatment to confirm the long-
term, sterilizing activity of LAI regimens. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop and non-clinically
validate a “one-shot” DARQ-based LAI treatment for TPT as well as an optimized LAI-based treatment
strategy for use in the continuation phase of active TB treatment."
10778621,"Grant title: Chlamydia type III effectors affecting the host actin-based cytoskeleton
Abstract:
Chlamydia trachomatis is a significant concern for human health world-wide due to its prevalence and
the combined health and socioeconomic impact of acute and chronic disease. Chlamydiae are obligate
intracellular pathogens that possess the ability to modulate host-cell biology while sequestered within a
membrane-bound parasitophorous vacuole. Accumulating evidence indicates that a type III secretion
system (T3SS) represents a significant mechanism employed by chlamydiae to manipulate these
critical host cell functions. The host actin cytoskeleton and vesicular transport machinery represent
major targets for Chlamydia-mediated alterations. We have identified a novel pathway by which
intracellular chlamydiae redirect host cell vesicular trafficking. This mechanism requires the branched
actin network and at least two type III secretion effectors designated TmeA and TmeB. We propose to
address the hypothesis that these effectors differentially modulate branched actin networks to
accomplish trafficking of host-cell resources to the mature inclusion by imposing an axis of host Arp2/3
activation. We propose to elucidate molecular details by which the combined activities of C. trachomatis
TmeA and TmeB affect host cells to promote intracellular development and evasion of cell-intrinsic host
defenses. Corresponding C. muridarum mutant strains will be employed to elucidate the contributions
of these effectors to pathogenesis in an animal model. A balanced combination of genetic, biochemical,
cell-biology, and animal-based studies are proposed that will define the overall role of these effectors in
establishing and maintaining infectivity that culminates in Chlamydia-mediated disease. Completion of
this work will lead to an enhanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms employed by Chlamydia
to impact host-pathogen interactions governing disease."

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (denoted COVID-19) pandemic has shaken the
foundation of services delivered to vulnerable families involved with or monitored by the child
protective/welfare system. COVID-19 has changed the landscape of how children and families interact with the
vital services provided by the child welfare system. Home visitation, which includes a bedrock of essential and
transformative parenting support services for families involved with child welfare, was no longer safe or viable
in the presence of COVID-19. The pandemic shredded safety nets. It made evident to providers, administrators,
and policymakers how fragile our child protective system is. Under this strained state, child welfare agencies
and mental health providers innovated service delivery systems. In Washington State, the Department of
Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) worked with local service agencies providing evidence-based programs
to revise program protocols. Provider teams and program developers worked together to transition in-person
services to remote platforms by developing and delivering telehealth services to families. The pandemic created
the conditions for a natural experiment in service delivery in Washington State. The natural experiment proved
that telehealth services are a viable service delivery system; thousands of child welfare involved families were
served via telehealth. We do not know, however, if these services were effective, or which families had the
technological capacity to engage, or for those who did engage were they able to complete the program. Did
online home visiting produce the expected outcomes? While online delivery was an innovation driven by the
necessity in response to COVID-19, many questions remain. The potential is high, but little is known about
telehealth in child welfare. This proposal is a three-arm effectiveness trail of an evidence-based home visiting
program: 1) delivered online, 2) delivered in-person, and 3) usual care. We will assess the effectiveness of
Promoting First Relationships (PFR: a 10-week model) to improve observed parent-child interaction and
caregivers’ knowledge of social and emotional development in a sample of 358 caregivers with children under
age 18 months at enrollment. We will also assess if PFR reduces child externalizing behavior and reduces out of
home placements of the child into foster care. We will assess the cost-effectiveness of providing PFR via
telehealth. We will address the degree to which families in Child Protective Services (CPS) have the technology
needed to engage with telehealth services, as well as family satisfaction and compliance. Finally, we will
measure service providers’ fidelity to the PFR model and their adherence to delivering PFR via telehealth. The
proposed study leverages a longstanding partnership between the University of Washington and Washington
State DCYF, overseeing services in child welfare to answer these questions."
10871839,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Basement membrane (BM) is a dense, sheet-like extracellular matrix that surrounds most tissues. During
development and immune cell trafficking, specialized cells acquire the unique ability to breach BM barriers to
disperse, construct tissues, and migrate to sites of infection and injury. Cell invasion is also inappropriately
initiated during numerous diseases and underlies tissue destruction in asthma, stroke, arthritis, multiple
sclerosis, and metastatic cancer. Understanding how cells traverse BM barriers is thus of fundamental
importance in improving human health. Cell invasion events are often stochastic, rapid, and involve dynamic
adhesions and communication between the invading cell, the BM, and the neighboring tissues. Owing to this
complexity, it is not possible to faithfully recapitulate cell invasion with in vitro assays, and it has been difficult
to visualize and genetically dissect invasion in vertebrate tissues. As a result, the mechanisms underlying cell
invasive behavior remain poorly understood. Anchor cell invasion in C. elegans is a highly stereotyped in vivo
model of cell invasion that uniquely combines many powerful experimental approaches including subcellular
visual analysis of cell-BM interactions, molecular activity sensors, rapid genome editing, cell-type specific gene
manipulation, and powerful forward genetic and functional genomic approaches. Using these strengths, this
study will characterize how invading cells acquire and use energy to fuel BM invasion. This work will reveal
mechanisms that direct polarized glucose import and the construction of specialized electron transport chain
enriched mitochondria that provide localized ATP to power the BM breaching machinery. Further, the outlined
experiments will determine how lipid biosynthesis is integrated into a conserved cell invasion transcriptional
program and how lipid producing enzymes, which are overexpressed in most metastatic cancers, build a large,
transient, invasive protrusion that opens paths through BM barriers. The proposed study will also elucidate how
invasive cells adapt their invasion program to the absence of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by physically
displacing the BM, which will inform more effective approaches to block invasion with MMP inhibitors that have
thus far failed to be effective in clinical trials. Finally, this work will identify molecular mechanisms that prevent
and heal plasma membrane damage during BM breaching, thus revealing mechanisms that could be exploited
to target cells in the act of invading. These integrative studies spanning cellular energetics, extracellular matrix,
transcriptional regulation, and membrane dynamics are relevant to the NIH’s mission as they will lead to a
deeper understanding of the fundamental biological process of cell invasive behavior, thus allowing for the
development of better therapeutic strategies to modulate invasion in human disease."
10813177,"ABSTRACT
Cells tightly regulate translation initiation in order to control which proteins they synthesize and
how much of each protein they produce. This regulation of protein synthesis matches translation
levels with the cell's translational capacity and physiological needs. Translation initiation, in
particular, is a key point for both global and transcript-speciﬁc regulation. In the canonical
pathway for translation initiation, an mRNA is ﬁrst activated by the formation of a closed-loop
complex bridging between the 5'-methylguanosine cap and the 3'-polyadenylate tail. A small
ribosomal subunit, accompanied by a variety of other initiation factors, is recruited to the mRNA
and scans in order to begin translation at the ﬁrst AUG.
Recent evidence suggests that translation initiation does not proceed down such a uniform
pathway. Individual translation factors are subject to regulation downstream of major signaling
pathways, including MAP kinase cascades, mTOR kinase signaling, and the integrated stress
response. Activation or inhibition of core translation initiation factors can produce transcript-
speciﬁc changes in translation, leading to broad translational reprogramming. Translation of
developmentally regulated genes also depends on cryptic initiation factors such as eIF2A,
eIF2D, and DENR/MCTS-1.
Our motivating hypothesis is that this heterogeneous landscape of translation initiation
complexes underlies dynamic, mRNA-speciﬁc control of protein synthesis. Here, we propose to
use proximity labeling of protein and RNA in order to survey the composition of translation
initiation complexes that assemble in vivo and understanding how this changes in response to
physiological and environmental signals. We will couple this with an analysis of translational
across the transcriptome. Together, these results will reveal the full diversity of pathways for
translation initiation in vivo and show how these different pathways mediate translational
expression programs."
10827380,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Neurons are capable of activating pathways that induce either the degeneration of the entire cell by
apoptosis or to selectively degenerate only the axons by pruning. While the main components of the caspase
activating machinery during apoptosis and pruning have been identified, a fundamental question of whether
the apoptotic machinery is activated throughout the neuronal soma and axons, or is spatially restricted, during
these events remains unknown. This question is most relevant in the context of pruning where one predicts the
apoptotic machinery to be localized to the targeted axons undergoing degeneration. However, we were
surprised to find an unexpected spatial restriction of caspase activation even during apoptosis, where we found
these to be restricted primarily to the soma, even though both soma and axons degenerate.
 In this proposal, we will mechanistically examine the spatial localization of the apoptotic machinery in
neurons during apoptosis and pruning. We will utilize neurons cultured in microfluidic chamber devices to
allow for the spatial segregation and manipulation of neuronal somas and axons. Our hypothesis is that during
apoptosis and pruning, the restricted caspase activity causes the “physiological axotomy” of axons, activating
the Sarm1-mediated axotomy pathway of axon degeneration. The concept that the developmental pathways of
apoptosis and pruning can cause axotomy is novel because these pathways were considered to be distinct from
the injury-induced axotomy pathway.
 In Aim 1, we will define the spatial restriction of the apoptotic machinery in neurons during apoptosis and
axon pruning. In Aim 2, we focus on examining the function of Sarm1 during apoptosis and axon pruning. In
Aim 3, we will investigate the Sarm1-deficient mice for pruning defects in vivo and evaluate if these mice
exhibit behavioral deficits. This project opens exciting areas of research not only because of its new concepts
for apoptosis and pruning, but also because it brings into focus a developmental function of Sarm1 that is
beyond its recognized role in axon injury."
10818347,"The lysosome transmembrane protein TMEM106B was originally identified as a risk factor for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with granulin (GRN) mutations and was recently associated with many other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s (AD), Parkinson’s and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). TMEM106B is also identified as one of the main determinants of brain aging. More interestingly, a D252N mutation in the lumenal domain of TMEM106B was recently found to cause hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (HLD). However, the cellular and physiological functions of TMEM106B remain to be determined. In our preliminary studies, we found that TMEM106B deficiency causes the clustering of lysosomes in the perinuclear region and a block of lysosome transport in the axon initial segment (AIS). TMEM106B deficient mice show autophagy defects and FTD related pathology such as accumulation of phosphorylated TDP-43 during aging. We hypothesize that TMEM106B regulates myelination, autophagy, brain aging and TDP-43 pathology via modulating lysosome trafficking and movement. We plan to determine the mechanisms by which TMEM106B regulates lysosome positioning, lysosome transport along axons and autophagy flow using cell biological and biochemical approaches (Aim1). Our studies have also shown that TMEM106B is highly expressed in oligodendrocytes and TMEM106B deficiency leads to myelination defects in mice. Ablation of TMEM106B leads to trafficking defects of the myelin membrane protein PLP due to increased lysosome clustering in the peri-nuclear region and decreased lysosome exocytosis. We plan to further characterize myelination defects of TMEM106B deficient mice, especially near the AIS region, and determine the effect of the D252N mutation on TMEM106B function and myelination (Aim2). Finally, we found that mice deficient in both TMEM106B and GRN have severe lysosome abnormalities, glial activation, neurodegeneration and accumulation of TDP-43 aggregates. We plan to further dissect how TMEM106B genetically interacts with GRN to regulate TDP-43 pathology and FTD disease progression using mouse models and human patient samples (Aim3). In summary, the proposed studies will shed light on cellular and physiological functions of TMEM106B, the genetic interaction between GRN and TMEM106B and the molecular and cellular mechanisms of many brain disorders with TMEM106B association, including HLD, LATE, AD and, FTD. Our work will also yield novel insights into mechanisms involved in regulating TDP-43 aggregation in AD, FTD and LATE and how myelination defects contribute to neurodegenerative phenotypes in AD, FTD and other brain disorders."
10764824,"PROJECT SUMMARY
It is increasingly recognized that certain metabolic enzymes are required in cells not for what they produce,
but instead for processing and thus preventing the accumulation of their substrates which may have toxic
properties. Such enzymes can be attractive therapeutic targets, as their inhibition can poison cancer cells
with self-produced toxic metabolites in a manner that is highly dependent on production of the toxic
metabolite. Here we investigate a new detoxifying enzyme, ketodehydrosphinganine reductase (KDSR),
which is part of the de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway. We find that KDSR is not required to
provide sphingolipids, as cancer cells can readily salvage them from their environment, but instead is
needed to prevent accumulation of its substrate 3-ketodehydrosphinganine (3KDS). Accumulation of
3KDS, either via KDSR KO or by direct treatment of 3KDS to cells, appears to disrupt the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and cause an overload of misfolded proteins in cancer cells. This indicates KDSR as a
potential cancer therapy target capable of impairing ER function and proteostasis in cancer cells, which
we will explore in this proposal. In Aim 1, we will examine the upstream steps that drive 3KDS production,
which we hypothesize are elevated in multiple cancer subtypes, and thus directly renders the cells
dependent on KDSR for 3KDS detoxification. These will be further considered as possible biomarkers for
tumors that would respond to KDSR targeting. In Aim 2, we will examine how 3KDS accumulation disrupts
the ER and leads to death, and the responses mounted by cancer cells to counter 3KDS toxicity. In Aim
3, we will gauge the therapeutic potential of targeting KDSR by comparing 3KDS production capacity
between tumor tissues and normal tissues from animal models and from deidentified patient tissues. In
this manner we hope to provide a working blueprint for how to selectively target subtypes and
subpopulation of cancer cells based on their 3KDS producing activities, provide biomarkers which predict
whether a tumor will respond to such a therapy, and provide new insights into the endoplasmic reticulum-
and proteostasis- related vulnerabilities of cancer cells."

The nasal cavity has a unique microbiome, which is expected to significantly affect local immune response
and in turn, susceptibility of the host to respiratory viruses. However, we know little about these potential host-
microbe interactions. Our long-term goal is to elucidate how microbiome-immune interactions and dynamics
within the nasal cavity affect host susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory conditions. This project’s
objective is to determine natural dynamics of correlations between nasal microbiome and local immune
environment and how this relationship affects host susceptibility to respiratory viral infections. Our central
hypothesis is that during homeostasis, the nasal microbiome impacts local antiviral immune defenses,
including epithelial integrity, mucus properties, and antiviral cytokines and specific nasal microbiome-immune
environments defined by low-inflammation and high-interferon levels will confer greater natural protection
against respiratory viral infections. The rationale for this project is that our knowledge regarding the adult
nasal microbiome and immune environment during homeostasis is limited. Addressing this gap can
immediately improve our fundamental understanding of the adult nasal cavity and inform strategies that
promote naturally occurring protection against respiratory viral infections.
Aim 1. Elucidate dynamics of the homeostatic nasal microbiome and immune environment in adults.
We will achieve this aim by studying (i) the homeostatic nasal microbiome and innate immune profile in a
cross-section of adults (n = 400) and (ii) assessing short- and long-term dynamics of adult nasal environment
by selecting and following 118 adults through monthly and quarterly dense sampling over a 12-month period.
Aim 2. Determine how the nasal microbiome-immune environment affects susceptibility to an intra-
nasal virus challenge. We will achieve this aim by studying how pre-vaccination nasal microbiome-immune
environments impact post-vaccination viral infection and replication among adult FluMist® recipients (n = 200)
per year in Years 1 and 2.
Aim 3. Elucidate interactions between nasal microbiome, nasal immune environment, and host
susceptibility to respiratory viruses in vitro. We will achieve this aim by assessing effect of nasal
microbiome composition and nasal bacterial absolute abundance on: (i) innate immune defenses and (ii)
influenza A, rhinovirus, and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity using an innovative in vitro nasal microbiome-respiratory
epithelial co-culture model.
The proposed research is innovative because it represents a departure from the status quo by assessing
how the nasal microbiome, which is ubiquitous and diverse, could affect natural immune environment.
significant because it is expected to identify nasal microbiome features and immune profiles that confer
natural antiviral protection, which could inform novel strategies to reduce the risk for respiratory viral infections."

 The cell cycle is an ordered set of cellular processes that produces two identical
daughter cells. This process involves DNA replication and chromosome segregation leading to
cell division. Cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk1) drives eukaryotic cell cycle progression and cell
proliferation. Cdk1 is a serine/threonine kinase whose activity depends on its binding partner,
cyclin. The cyclin/Cdk1 complex phosphorylates various substrates at S/TP consensus motifs to
trigger a downstream signaling cascade. The cell cycle is a unidirectional process which is
regulated by temporal degradation of the cyclins. This Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation event is
reversed by the phosphatases PP2A and Cdc14 in S. cerevisiae. PP2A is a heterotrimer with
two possible regulatory subunits in yeast: Cdc55 or Rts1, which direct the complex to distinct
targets. PP2A-Cdc55 preferentially dephosphorylates Cdk1 substrates at threonine residues in
mitosis. Here we propose that PP2A-Cdc55 positively regulates DNA replication through Cdc6
and negatively regulates mitotic spindle elongation through Pds1 in S. cerevisiae. This
mechanism ensures unidirectional cell cycle progression to maintain genome integrity. Aberrant
cell cycle control leads to chromosome instability which is a hallmark of cancer. Our long-term
goal is to understand the role of phosphatase in control of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.
 In this proposal, two aims will test my hypothesis that PP2A-Cdc55 promotes origin
licensing to initiate DNA replication and negatively regulates spindle elongation in S.
cerevisiae.
Aim1 will define the role of PP2A-Cdc55 in origin licensing. The general strategy of Aim1 is to
study how Cdc6 and other DNA replication proteins are regulated by PP2A-Cdc55.
Aim2 will determine how PP2A-Cdc55 dependent Pds1 dephosphorylation inhibits spindle
elongation. We will test if PP2A-Cdc55 controls spindle elongation through Pds1-Esp1 and
other downstream targets.
The PP2A is frequently found to be inactivated in cancer patients making PP2A a potential
therapeutic target. In this study, we will use a single cell model organism, S. cerevisiae, to
understand the basic mechanism of how PP2A controls the cell cycle. DNA replication and
mitosis are well conserved cellular events in eukaryotes. The yeast components focused on in
this project are well conserved in humans. The results obtained from this study can be applied
to understanding how PP2A functions in higher eukaryotes."

This proposal for a mentored career development award consists of a training and research plan devised to
facilitate Dr. David Jacobs' transition to an independent investigator focusing on the implementation of
medication use interventions during the transition from hospital to home for high-needs patients. Dr. Jacobs is a
clinical pharmacist with an advanced degree in epidemiology and health services and has significant experience
conducting clinical research. The candidate's current research is focused on transition of care interventions.
Given the resource intensive nature of these interventions, the sustainability of these programs will heavily
depend on identifying and targeting patients at high-risk for hospital readmission. To anticipate such admissions,
predictive models have been developed; however, our ability to predict hospital readmissions remains poor. This
is likely because detailed social information, which is disproportionately represented in high-needs populations,
is typically absent in risk stratification tools. Therefore, the long-term research objective is to build predictive
models that combine social information with rich clinical data to individualize care management interventions
and reduce readmissions. The specific aims are: (i) to determine social risk factors driving hospital readmissions
by conducting semi-structured interviews with patients, their caregivers, and clinicians; (ii) to develop a risk-
prediction model using advanced informatics techniques; and (iii) to develop and test the feasibility of a pilot
intervention aimed at improving transition strategies. This work will focus on a singular complex condition, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in developing a risk stratification tool in order to improve its predictive
performance for identifying high-risk patients. COPD will serve as the model condition since it is one of the major
readmission diagnoses, and there exists a high level of complexity following hospital discharge at patients' care
transition. This award will provide the applicant with mentor-guided didactic and experiential learning to address
the following career development objectives: 1) gain experiential learning in qualitative methodology, 2) advance
his knowledge in biomedical informatics and develop predictive models integrating high-dimensional electronic
health record data, and 3) increase his understanding of implementation science and gain practical experience
in conducting a pragmatic clinical trial. The primary mentor, Dr. Sanjay Sethi, and the mentorship team will work
closely to monitor his progress toward independence and will provide him with the guidance and the resources
to guarantee his success. The proposed study leverages the extensive resources available at the University at
Buffalo to address an important public health issue. Achieving the proposed aims and acquiring these advanced
skills will position the candidate to submit successful R01s testing the proposed clinical prediction model and
transition strategy in real-world settings. In summary, a comprehensive career development plan in the context
of a well-defined training, research, and mentorship structure will allow Dr. Jacobs to emerge as a highly
successful, independent clinician-investigator in health services research."

Dementia is the progressive loss in memory and cognition of the brain. Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) is the leading cause of dementia in those over the age of 65. Currently, there are ~5.6
million Americans age 65 and older have AD, and the projected AD patients will double by 2050.
The social and economic burden of neurodegenerative diseases is enormous and no cure or
prevention is available to date. Late onset AD accounts more than 98% of all AD cases and is a
multifactorial disease, with aging being the most prominent risk factor. In addition to the genetic
makeup of a patient, environmental factors, such as microbial infection, contribute significantly
to the development and outcome of AD.
Herpesviruses are ubiquitous in human and their infection is often asymptomatic in immune-
competent individuals. Recent studies suggest a causal role of several herpesviruses,
particularly herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), in AD and other related dementia. How HSV-1
contributes to AD pathogenesis is not well understood. In studying host innate immunity against
herpesvirus, we discovered that NAMPT, the rate-limiting enzyme of the salvage NAD synthesis
pathway, potently restricts HSV-1 lytic replication. Loss of NAMPT greatly increases HSV-1
replication in mice. To counteract the NAMPT-mediated restriction, HSV-1 deploys deamidation
to inactivate NAMPT and promote viral replication. Collateral to the HSV-1-induced immune
evasion, deamidated NAMPT is severely impaired in synthesizing NAD+. Thus, HSV-1-induced
NAMPT deamidation and subsequent impaired salvage synthesis of NAD+ likely contribute to
the HSV-1-induced neurodegeneration. Interestingly, aging also induces NAMPT deamidation in
the brain. In this study, we will delineate the role of deamidation in host defense and salvage
NAD+ synthesis in neurons and in mice. We will also determine how aging and HSV-1 infection
synergize to promote NAMPT deamidation and NAD+ depletion, thus fueling neurodegeneration
in normal mouse strains. Finally, we will develop a modality to resist NAMPT deamidation that
impedes or reverts neurodegeneration and AD development. This study will elucidate an
innovative mechanism by which collateral damage of viral immune evasion and aging
collaborate to induce neurodegeneration, offering new insight into possible avenues to thwart
AD and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging and microbial infection."

Sanfilippo disease (mucopolysaccharidosis type III; MPS III) is a devastating neurodegenerative lysosomal
storage disorder of childhood whose pathologic features are neurologic: slowing of development, severe
behavioral problems, progressive cognitive decline, dementia, and decline in motor skills leading to immobility,
unresponsiveness, and death. We have focused on MPS IIID caused by a deficiency of alpha-N-
acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase (GNS). Because MPS IIID is rare (1 in a million) and affects the brain (which is
difficult to treat) no cure or treatment is available and there are at least five patients in the USA to our knowledge.
Sanfilippo patient organizations have 19 additional cases registered around the world (see letter of support). Dr.
Patricia Dickson and Dr. Tsui-Fen Chou (LABioMed) have developed an enzyme replacement treatment (ERT)
for MPS IIID. Our strategy proposes to deliver recombinant human alpha-N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase
(rhGNS) via intracerebroventricular infusion to effectively treat the underlying causes of the neurologic symptoms
that dominate MPS III pathology. ERTs can have a dramatic effect on the quality of life and patient development
especially when administered early in developments. There are several examples of successfully
commercialized ERT’s (e.g. laronidase (MPS I), idursulfase (MPS II), etc.) and BioMarin recently received
approval for an ERT for a form of Batten disease, CLN2. Other ERTs for MPS I, II, and IIIB are in Phase I trials.
Both the FDA and investors are familiar with ERT and its commercialization path, which will greatly increase the
chances of reaching a clinical trial. LABioMed has filed a US patent on rhGNS and Phoenix Nest, Inc. has
licensed it. Our pivotal nonclinical and manufacturing plans are on track.
We had a positive interaction with the FDA and got guidance for moving our program into the clinics. In
preparation for the interventional study the recommendation was for a thorough natural history study (NHS) in
the available patient population with a broad net to capture endpoints that are most likely to predict the clinical
benefits in each individual. Since the number of diagnosed patients is small the collected data form each
individual would be their own control at the time of intervention, where the patient will receive the recombinant
enzyme. Most of the work will be executed by contracted service providers. The clinical trial itself will be
conducted at NYU under the guidance of Dr. Lau. She has experience with over 10 clinical trials interventional
and observational. The clinical protocol was designed by the team at Phoenix Nest with help of KOLs and clinical
experts in the MPS III field. We have engaged expert third party clinical service providers to help with the
execution, monitoring and data collection. Crucial data collected from the patients on this study will help us
develop clinical outcomes that will be tools for measuring the efficacy of our rhGNS therapy and will be primary
endpoints on the pivotal study. The success on this trial will put a step closer to executing the pivotal trial to
assess the efficacy of our experimental therapy and its commercialization."

If oxygen supply to the brain does not match its demands, cellular functions are impeded and
can lead to cell death. A margin is created between oxygen supply and brain demand by
metabolic and hemodynamic reserves. Our preliminary data show that children may have less
reserve due to the critical, but costly energy demands of brain growth and maturation. We have
shown that lower oxygen supply (hypoxemia) also decreases reserves, and during childhood,
may result in impaired brain growth and development. Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA)
have chronic hypoxemia due to reduced hemoglobin. Children with SCA have smaller brain
volumes and decreased cortical thickness than unaffected children. The intersection of
hypoxemia and brain development is poorly understood, impeding our ability to optimize brain
development and neurologic outcomes in children with hypoxemia. The goal of this project is to
identify physiologic mechanisms of vulnerability and age-dependent consequences of
hypoxemia. Our central hypothesis is that the high cerebral metabolic demand in younger
children decreases oxygen reserve, resulting in an age-dependent increased risk for impaired
brain growth in children with lower oxygen supply. First, we will assess normal developmental
changes in metabolic and hemodynamic reserve in 80 healthy children ages 4-21 to determine
age-dependence of reserves (Aim 1). Next, we will determine the effects of hypoxemia on
metabolic and hemodynamic reserves and the consequence of hypoxemia on brain
development. We will compare 40 children with SCA and 40 age and sex-matched controls at
baseline and 3 year follow-up imaging, and examine cortical thickness changes in the two
cohorts (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate whether oxygen reserve increased through
hydroxyurea treatment in an SCA cohort impacts long-term brain development. We will utilize a
large sickle cell database with 16 years of brain imaging to compare cortical thickness
maturation and total brain volumes between treated and untreated children (Aim 3). Determining
the age-dependence of hypoxemic vulnerability and its effect on brain development will allow us
to personalize treatment strategies for children at high risk for neurodevelopmental injury to be
more aggressive during periods of highest vulnerability."
10809681,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cellular turnover is essential for the form and function of epithelial tissues. The rate of cell turnover slows during
aging, can be accelerated during injury and repair, and is precociously stimulated during carcinogenesis; but the
mechanisms guiding it in living tissues is not well understood. We recently discovered that elimination of unfit
cells by extrusion from epithelia stimulates proliferation of nearby stem cells to replace the lost cells and maintain
overall cell numbers in the tissue. This intriguing finding suggests extrusion provides a key link between cell loss
and proliferation, and thereby controls the rate of cell turnover. Thus, identification of the mechanisms that
underlie extrusion may provide new insights into endogenous processes that can be leveraged to promote
cellular replacement or prevent the unwanted addition of new cells. Our long-term goal is to define the cellular
and molecular mechanisms underlying the rate of cellular turnover in epithelial tissues. Using the developing
zebrafish to study cell extrusion in a living epithelial tissue, we have found that cells fated to extrude alter their
mechanical properties in the form of pulsatile actomyosin contractions that are controlled by enrichment of the
bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). We have also interrogated the cell loss-induced signaling events
and cellular responses, including inflammatory cell recruitment and epidermal cell proliferation, that drive
turnover. We identified a significant upregulated expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor ligand epigen
(EPGN) upon induced cell extrusion, suggesting that transient increases in EPGN may aid in sustaining epithelial
form and function during cell loss. Consistent with this idea, we found that treatment with recombinant human
EPGN (hrEPGN) suppressed epithelial cell extrusion after receiving damage stimuli, which in turn reduced the
compensatory stem cell proliferation. These data led to the hypothesis that EPGN regulates extrusion to dictate
the rate of cellular turnover in epithelial tissues. One formidable challenge to studying cellular turnover and testing
this hypothesis in a living organism involves visualizing and perturbing the complex interplay between extruding
cells, the surrounding stem cells that replace the lost cells and immune cells to sense and respond to disruptions
in integrity. Therefore, we created tools to manipulate different cellular and molecular components individually
or in combination in living epithelial tissues of developing zebrafish and analyze changes to turnover in the
presence of an innate immune system. Our work over the next five years we utilize this new approach and will
focus on three essential areas that emerged from our ongoing studies and address key gaps in our knowledge
of cellular turnover. First, we will determine the mechanisms regulating the localized changes in physical forces
that are required to remove defective cells by extrusion. Second, we will determine how cell loss promotes
changes in the epigenetic and transcriptional states in surrounding stem cells to stimulate proliferation and
replace the lost cells. Third, we will determine the role of the innate immune system in promoting cell turnover
and maintenance of epithelial tissue homeostasis."

The importance of elucidating the molecular mechanisms that underlie cell-to-cell communication
is impossible to overstate. Intercellular communication formed the foundation for the evolution of
metazoans; then as organisms grew larger, the transduction of signals over distance assumed
crucial importance. Long-range signaling in which cells must communicate accurately over
several cell diameters is vital both during development and for homeostasis. Deficiencies in the
proper execution of the process often results in disease or death. The study of human cancers
provides numerous examples of what can happen when a component of a signaling process goes
bad. Numerous signaling pathways have been characterized over the past few decades, and a
large number of the molecules involved in intercellular signal transduction, both extracellular
ligands and their cognate cellular receptors, have been identified. However, gaps still exist at
present in what is known of the means by which signals are propagated. The diffusion-based
propagation model suggested more than 60 years ago has been the dominant paradigm. This
has been particularly true in developmental biology regarding the impact of concentration
gradients that are predicted to form as signaling molecules passively diffuse through tissues.
Nevertheless, debate has continued on how well such models can explain the precision by which
various signals are transmitted over distances of multiple cell diameters.
Recently, several research groups including our own have shown that signaling molecules can
also be delivered accurately over such distances by direct cell-cell contact that involves the
extension of long, thin cellular protrusions (also referred to as signaling filopodia). We have
identified a novel variety of such protrusions extending from zebrafish pigment cells that we have
named ‘airinemes.’ Airinemes have been seen to be an indispensable component of stripe pattern
formation in zebrafish epidermis based on their mediation of long-distance Delta-Notch signaling
between pigment cell types. Intriguingly, we have also discovered that this airineme-mediated
long-range intercellular signaling is dependent on participation of skin-resident macrophages.
Collectively, our findings denote that mechanisms of signal propagation can involve much more
than mere passive diffusion of molecules. Moreover, we subsequently found airinemes protruding
from other cell types of the epidermis, e.g., keratinocytes, suggesting that airineme-mediated
signaling may be a general mechanism in at least that tissue if not others. Although the
airineme/macrophage-mediated signaling that we have described has been clearly validated as
occurring in vivo, the molecular and cellular details of how this signaling is accomplished are still
not sufficiently described. Those details are a crucial first step in linking anomalies in this mode
of signaling with the occurrence of various pathologies in vertebrates. In this proposal we will
address questions essential to establishing how airinemes achieve target specificity, whether
there is a particular subset of skin-resident macrophages that promotes airineme-mediated
signaling, and determining what functions airinemes provide in zebrafish keratinocytes. The
answers to these questions will not only expand our view of fundamental cellular strategies
employed in paracrine signaling but could also provide a basis for detecting where biomedicine
might be able to intervene in the process when signaling goes awry in human pathophysiology."

Clinical and translational research (CTR) across Harvard is conducted at 17 independent and geographically
dispersed institutions, including Harvard Medical School (HMS), Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health,
and 15 HMS-affiliated academic health care centers. Each of these institutions is fiscally and operationally
independent with their own governance, faculty, IRB, and electronic health records. Harvard Catalyst (HC)
serves as the sole coordinating entity for CTR and has brought these institutions together as a federated CTR
network. Since 2008, HC has developed a substantial portfolio of educational and CTR resources to meet the
needs of the CTR workforce at Harvard and, when their value has been demonstrated at Harvard,
disseminated them to the CTSA consortium. Moving forward, HC’s overarching vision is to partner with our
CTR workforce, institutions, and communities to become a living clinical and translational science (CTS)
learning laboratory. The CTS learning laboratory will continuously assess and reassess the hub’s CTR
strengths and weaknesses, developing and implementing programmatic innovations to improve the efficiency,
quality, effectiveness, and impact of CTR. Using the principles and methodologies of CTS and guided by a
logic model, HC is committed to achieving these goals and overcoming translational roadblocks. Seven
translational roadblocks have been prioritized that can be mitigated or overcome: 1) educational resources are
not reaching all learners and have been focused on investigators, rather than investigational teams; 2)
extensive research resources are frequently invisible and difficult to access; 3) substantial structural and
regulatory barriers limit cross-institutional collaborations; 4) research and clinical data need to be connected
and their access democratized; 5) CTR workforce is not sufficiently diverse and must be grown in all domains;
6) there is limited access to and participation by diverse populations in research; and 7) insufficient
mechanisms exist to support implementation of CTR evidence into practice. HC will also focus on better
understanding and meeting the needs of early-stage and underrepresented in medicine investigators and their
teams, as well as diverse patient populations and communities, while working to diversify the workforce and
reduce health inequities. Multiple initiatives are proposed to address five specific aims: 1) train and diversify
the CTR workforce; 2) connect trainees and CTR teams with HC resources; 3) partner with community
stakeholders to improve research participation; 4) democratize health informatics; and 5) use CTS to overcome
significant CTR roadblocks. HC is eager to learn from other CTSA hubs and is committed to dissemination and
sharing across the CTSA consortium. The insights derived from employing CTS approaches will be used to
overcome translational roadblocks and advance the collective national goal of improving human health."

their incidence of diseases of aging, including cancer, is increasing. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the causal
agent for almost all cervical and anal cancers, and ~50% of head and neck cancers. Cervical cancer, an AlDS-
defining malignancy, is a leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide. The transforming capability of
HPV is enhanced in women LWH (WLWH), whose HPV-related cervical lesions are more prevalent, more
likely to progress, and more likely to become cancer. HPV also causes transformation of the anal mucosa. Men
who have sex with men (MSM) constitute a substantial proportion of persons living with HIV (PLWH) around
the world, and the incidence of HPV-related anal cancer is growing among MSM living with HIV. The incidence
of cervical and anal cancers has not declined with the introduction of ART and remains elevated several fold in
women and men LWH.
 We propose to establish an HIV-Associated HPV-related Malignancies Research Center (HAMRC) in
Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a partnership of four institutions: Albert Einstein
College of Medicine, the University of Rwanda (UR), Rwanda Military Hospital (major teaching hospital for

an extension of our current U54-funded Rwanda/Einstein Research Consortium for HIV/HPV Malignancies,

investigator research capacity. We will build upon and strengthen our existing partnerships to create a
dynamic, integrated and flexible platform with academic, clinical and administrative expertise to support and
foster the growth of scientific knowledge in HPV-related cancers in PLWH.
 We propose two research projects to be conducted over five years that can quickly impact the
prevention of HIV/HPV cancers by supporting evidence-based decision-making to improve health outcomes:
1.) population based effectiveness of HPV vaccination in Rwandan women; and 2.) HPV prevalence and
disease burden in men who have sex with men (MSM) in DRC and Rwanda. Embedded in both of these
projects will be studies of the interaction of the local microbial flora with cervicovaginal, anal, and penile HPV
infection. We propose to support both projects by developing laboratory capacity in molecular diagnostics in
DRC, and in next generation sequencing (NGS) in Rwanda. Leadership will be provided by a team of four
multiple principal investigators (MPIs): Kathryn Anastos MD, Leon Mutesa MD PhD, Marcel Yotebieng MD
PhD, and Philip Castle PhD MPH, bringing strong experience in each or our three countries, Rwanda, DRC

Despite progress in the management of chronic heart failure (CHF), it remains a leading cause of mortality and
morbidity worldwide. A reduction in Nrf2 signaling has been closely associated with oxidative stress-mediated
cardiac remodeling and sympathetic excitation in the pathogenesis of CHF. However, there are several critical
gaps in our current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of Nrf2 signaling dysregulation and cross-talk
between the heart and brain in CHF. Here our long-term goal is to understand a unique mechanism by which
Nrf2 signaling is impaired through intra- and inter-organ communication in CHF. In previous studies we showed
the potential involvement of miRNAs and extracellular vesicles (EVs) in Nrf2 dysregulation in CHF. EV-enriched
miRNAs have recently emerged as regulators of intercellular communication and paracrine signaling mediators
during physiological and pathological processes in the cardiovascular system. These findings led to the central
hypothesis that myocardial infarction (MI) induces the preferential secretion of miRNA-enriched EVs from cardiac
cells into the extracellular space where EV-miRNAs either directly contribute to increased local oxidative stress
via intercellular communication, or circulate to the CNS evoking sympathetic excitation by disrupting central
redox homeostasis due to a reduction in Nrf2 signaling. We have identified several miRNAs that target Nrf2
mRNA and are selectively upregulated in cardiac cells and contained in EVs that are secreted into the
extracellular space. We also provide evidence that cardiac-derived EVs and Nrf2-targeting miRNAs are present
in sympatho-regulatory areas of the brain. Guided by this strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three
Specific Aims: 1) To determine if EV-enriched miRNAs contribute to Nrf2 translational inhibition and redox
imbalance through intercellular communication in the heart in the CHF state; 2) To determine if cardiac derived
EVs participate in inter-organ communication, especially cross-talk between the heart and brain in the
progression of CHF, and 3) To determine if circulating EVs from CHF animals transfer a pathophysiological
phenotype in sympatho-regulatory areas of the brain. This aim will also evaluate if EV-mediated miRNA inhibitor
delivery (i.e. antagomirs) attenuates the CHF phenotype by inhibition of the decrease in Nrf2 and antioxidant
enzyme signaling. Collectively, the proposed research is innovative because it pursues the novel idea that
miRNA-enriched EVs contribute to increased oxidative stress at the local level and in remote sympatho-
regulatory areas of the brain via EV-mediated communication by disrupting redox homeostasis in the CHF state.
This novel communication pathway may help to explain how sympathetic nerve activity increases in the post MI
state independent of classical neural pathways. Incorporation of human tissue into these studies will provide a
unique translational component and potentially lead to new therapies and interventions in CHF."

Conserved mechanisms exist to eliminate DNA damage, which, if left unrepaired, can cause gene mutations and
genome rearrangements to trigger neoplastic cell transformation and oncogenesis. In particular, homologous
recombination (HR) represents a high-fidelity tool for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), interstrand
crosslinks, and collapsed DNA replication forks. Proper execution of HR requires the tumor suppressor BRCA2
(Breast Cancer 2). Germline mutations in BRCA2 lead to breast and ovarian cancer and also the cancer-prone
syndrome Fanconi anemia. Moreover, somatic driver BRCA2 mutations are found in a variety of cancer types.
Further work is necessary to elucidate the mechanistic role of BRCA2 in HR repair. Importantly, the research
proposed herein will help define the contributions of two distinct DNA binding domains toward the function of
BRCA2 as a “recombination mediator,” specifically in facilitating the assembly of complexes of the RAD51
recombinase on single-stranded DNA derived from the processing of DSBs. Our central hypothesis posits that
the two DNA-binding domains within BRCA2 play an essential role in guiding BRCA2-dependent DSB repair and
replication fork preservation through the engagement of single-stranded DNA and DNA structures present in
processed DSBs. We will conduct a variety of biochemical, genetic, and cell biological studies under two specific
aims to test this central tenet. Throughout these experiments, we will delineate how genetic mutations within
each DNA binding domain affect key aspects of HR and replication fork preservation. The results from this
fellowship project will not only expand our understanding of how the BRCA2 DNA-binding domains contribute to
the maintenance of genome stability, but they will also shed light on how mutations within these domains
ultimately cause malignancy. Furthermore, we expect our findings to help identify new targets and pathway pivot
points for the development of novel cancer therapeutics."

 My career goal is to lead an independent research group to investigate the pathology and resolution of
pain to solve neuropathic pain problems. To achieve this goal, I propose to develop and use novel translational
strategies to investigate neuron-substrate interactions in the skin layer using a combination of human and animal
models of peripheral sensory neuropathy. My research focuses on a common type of peripheral sensory
neuropathy induced by chemotherapy, which affects over 3 million people in the US alone. While chemotherapy-
induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) develops in up to 80% of cancer patients treated with chemotherapeutics,
there are no effective prevention or treatment strategies. Considering the dynamic extracellular environment of
cutaneous sensory nerves and recent understanding that keratinocytes can also function as a nociceptor, it is
vital to understand the maintenance and function of both neurons and keratinocytes to solve neuropathic pain.
Hence, I propose to test the hypothesis that dysregulation of neuron and epidermal interactions underlie
pathological progression of CIPN. Building from my recent work that identified protective roles of integrins in
CIPN, my proposal has three aims that use cutting-edge tools and innovative multi-disciplinary approaches. In
Aim 1, I will investigate neuron-substrate interactions and their regulatory mechanisms in a Drosophila in vivo
CIPN model. I will use genetics and advanced microscopy approaches to label, manipulate, and detect
subcellular changes in neuron to substrate contacts and link with functional changes in a CIPN model. Using
integrins as a model to understand cell surface protein-mediated mechanisms underlying CIPN, I will
characterize endocytic regulators that modulate surface protein expression mediating neuron-substrate contacts.
In Aim 2, I will use human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to identify keratinocyte-nociceptive
neuron interactions and cell-type-specific pathology in a co-culture CIPN model. Given species differences in
sensory neurons, I expect that establishing a human model to investigate the impact of sensory neurons and
extrinsic factors on pathological progression in CIPN will provide critical insights. In Aim 3, I will establish and
validate a 3D human skin-nerve co-culture CIPN model to investigate neuron-substrate relationships and
integrin-mediated protection. Because subtypes of nociceptive neurons target different epidermal layers and
contribute to distinct pathology in peripheral neuropathy, a 3D engineered human skin will be incorporated in the
model. This will allow me to investigate subtype-specific pathology and to resolve nociceptive neuron terminal
degeneration and dysfunction in CIPN. This proposal will provide new insights into pathological progression and
mechanisms mediated by neuron-substrate interactions and a strong foundation for my future research. As my
primary expertise is in neuroscience using Drosophila models, investigating human neurons and epidermal cells
requires new training in skin biology and stem cell biology. The proposed plan will significantly facilitate my career
goal to solve intractable neuropathic pain problems in patients."
10746869,"ABSTRACT
The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which vascular risk factors are associated with
biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk over time in middle aged adults with heart failure with preserved
ejection fraction (HFpEF). Mid-life cardiovascular risk factors contribute to the development of AD in later life
and to AD progression. Pathophysiologic mechanisms in HFpEF share mechanistic pathways implicated in AD
development, such as cerebral hypoperfusion, blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption, systemic and central
inflammation, and neurohormonal dysregulation. These AD pathways lead to accumulation of AD biomarkers
in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and blood. This study will enroll persons with HFpEF to elucidate vascular risk
factors specific to this understudied population with pathophysiologic drivers of vascular dysfunction associated
with AD risk. The proposed longitudinal study will test the hypothesis that midlife vascular risk factors predict
biomarkers of AD risk in persons with HFpEF. We will test the following Specific Aims in a high-risk cohort of
80 non-Hispanic White (n=40) and Black/African American (n=40) individuals during middle age (45-65yrs)
who have a diagnosis of HFpEF over 2 years: 1) assess the association of vascular risks with CSF biomarkers
of AD risk over two years in middle aged adults with HFpEF, 2) assess the association of vascular risks with
blood biomarkers of AD risk over two years in middle aged adults with HFpEF, and 3) assess the association
of vascular risks with cognitive function over two years in middle aged adults with HFpEF. This career
development award builds on previously developed strengths in studying mechanisms in cardiovascular
disease pathophysiology and aims to fill the gap related to Alzheimer’s disease research in the applicant’s
training. Specific career development goal included in this plan are: 1) gain expertise in the science of AD and
AD biomarkers, including collecting and analyzing AD biomarkers from blood and cerebrospinal fluid and
vascular function measures, 2) gain advanced training and experience in cognitive function measures, 3) gain
expertise in clinical trial implementation, 4) refine knowledge in health disparities research, and 5) transition to
independence and prepare for the next stage of my translational research program. Findings from this study
will lead to the identification of pathways that might be amenable to interventions that improve vascular
function for persons with HFpEF, with the goal of decreasing AD risk in this high morbidity population."
10812515,"Stimulation of the b-adrenergic receptor (bAR) during the flight-or-fight response increases contractility through
protein kinase A (PKA)-stimulated Ca2+ fluxes at the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). However, chronic stress on
the heart leads to long-term stimulation of the bAR by increased circulating catecholamines, resulting in
pathological remodeling due to Ca2+-mediated gene transcription. These divergent responses to bAR activation
and Ca2+ signaling suggests that multiples pools of bAR-regulated PKA activity exist in the cardiac myocyte. We
suggest that internal bARs at the nuclear envelope activate a PKA-stimulated perinuclear Ca2+ signals that
induce pathological gene transcription without affecting cardiac contractility. Therefore, reagents that can block
nuclear bAR and attenuate perinuclear Ca2+ transients should prevent disease initiation and/or progression
without affecting contractility. Our preliminary data finds that PKA bound to the nuclear envelope located
scaffolding protein muscle A-kinase anchoring protein b (mAKAPb) responds to internal bARs to initiate
perinuclear Ca2+ transients that stimulate pathological gene transcription. The central hypothesis of this proposal
is that targeting mAKAPb signalosomes will modulate nuclear b-AR-mediated PKA and Ca2+ responses that
induce pathological disease, without inhibiting, and in fact, maintaining cardiac contractility. Specific Aim 1:
Stimulation of a nuclear pool of Ca2+ is required for induction of cardiac hypertrophy. In this Aim, we will
buffer the mAKAPb-stimulated perinuclear Ca2+ pool using a specifically localized Ca2+ binging protein in order
to determine the importance of this pool for induction of cardiac hypertrophy in adult rat ventricular myoytes.
Using adeno-associated virus to deliver the mAKAPb-targeted Ca2+ “buffer” to the cardiac myocytes in vivo, we
will determine the effect on pathological remodeling induced by pressure overload and catecholamine infusion.
Importantly, the effect of buffering perinuclear Ca2+ on contractility will be investigated. Specific Aim 2:
Inhibition of mAKAPb-bound PKA blocks induction of cardiac hypertrophy. This Aim will use tools that
selectively modulate only mAKAPb-bound PKA to demonstrate that the associated kinase is both necessary and
sufficient for induction of cardiac hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo, while not regulating contractility. Specific Aim
3: A nuclear bAR receptor is responsible for cardiac hypertrophy. Using pharmacological inhibitors,
mAKAP-targeted nanobodies that inhibit specifically nuclear b-AR activation, and siRNA against specific b-AR
subtypes, we will test the hypothesis that internal, nuclear located bARs are responsible for induction of cardiac
hypertrophy. However, modulating these receptors should not affect contractility. Through these Aims, this
proposal will define a novel signaling compartment orchestrated by mAKAPb that is required for pathological
gene transcription and induction of cardiac disease, but does not affect contractility. Furthermore, completion of
this project will reveal how targeting mAKAPb signalosomes can be therapeutically beneficial in the prevention
of cardiac remodeling and heart failure."
10839450,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goal of this research program is to understand how specific axons of the developing central
nervous system (CNS) are ensheathed with specific amounts of myelin, a specialized, proteolipid-rich
membrane produced by oligodendroglia. During development, subpopulations of neural progenitors produce
oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which migrate and divide to populate the CNS. Subsequently, some
OPCs differentiate as myelinating oligodendrocytes whereas other OPCs persist through adulthood.
Importantly, myelin is plastic and can be modified by brain activity. Recent evidence indicates that changes in
OPC proliferation, oligodendrocyte differentiation, myelin sheath characteristics and axon selection for
myelination contribute to myelin plasticity. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate myelination,
particularly in response to neuronal activity, are poorly understood. The investigations that comprise this
research program focus on three broad areas of developmental myelination. First, using single cell RNA-seq
data we generated, we will investigate how neural progenitors are specified as OPCs. Second, will axo-glial
interactions and mRNA localization promote myelin sheath growth. Third, we will investigate how microglia, the
resident innate immune cells of the CNS, modify myelin coverage on axons in response to neuronal activity.
We use zebrafish as a model system, which enables us to combine time-lapse imaging with genetic and
pharmacological manipulations to observe and test cell behaviors and myelination in an intact, living animal.
The results of this research program have the potential to provide important new insights to the developmental
basis of learning, memory and psychiatric disease and to provide a foundation for designing therapeutic
strategies to promote myelination of brains damaged by disease or injury."
10829883,"Patients with advanced HIV infection are at risk for cryptococcosis, a devastating fungal infection that affects
primarily the central nervous system in the form of a difficult to treat meningoencephalitis. Numerous studies
over the past two decades have shown that antibody (Ab)-mediated immunity can make a critical contribution
to host defense against Cryptococcus neoformans. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are promising therapeutic
reagents for cryptococcosis. This fungus is unusual among pathogenic fungi in that it has a large
polysaccharide capsule that releases copious amounts of polysaccharide antigen into infected tissues, where it
can interfere with the immune response and thus facilitate the persistence of infection. Tissue antigens are
implicated in the pathogenesis of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, which often complicates the
rebound in immunity associated with antiretroviral therapy in patients with concurrent HIV and cryptococcal
infection. Currently, there is no therapy to remove polysaccharide from tissues. Our group discovered that
some mAbs to the C. neoformans capsule have catalytic activity that degrades the capsular polysaccharide. This
is an exciting finding because it raises the possibility of developing a new type of therapy for cryptococcosis
based on making cryptococcal cells vulnerable to the immune system by removing their capsule and degrading
tissue antigen deposits. This application proposes experiments to ascertain the contribution of Ab-mediated
catalysis to Ab-mediated protection with the goal of developing a new therapeutic strategy for patients with
AIDS-associated cryptococcosis based on clearance of tissue antigen deposits. Tissue clearance of cryptococcal
antigen will be done in both normal and immunodeficient mice to ascertain the contribution of inflammation
to this effect and mimic tissue responses in patients with AIDS. Our approach is to evaluate a large existing
collection of mAbs to identify the most effective catalytic Ab and explore the mechanisms by which Ab-
mediated catalysis affects cryptococcal cells. We will use site directed mutagenesis of the Ab-binding site to
map the catalytic domain and to generate variants with null catalytic activity that will allow us to discriminate
between classical Ab functions from those resulting from catalytic activity. Catalytic antibodies will be studied
in mouse models to ascertain their capacity to remove polysaccharide from tissue. Three aims are proposed: 1)
To establish the effect of Ab-mediated catalysis on the capsule of CN; 2.To identify the site of Ab-mediated
catalysis and generate mAbs with and without catalytic activity; and 3) To establish the consequences of Ab-
mediated GXM hydrolysis.. We anticipate that at the completion of this work we will be in a position to deploy
a new type of antibody therapy for patients with AIDS-related cryptococcosis."

10814973,"Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the topmost cause of acute liver failure (ALF) in the United States, with N-
acetylcysteine (NAC) as the only available pharmacological treatment. NAC is effective only in early presenting
patients, but majority of these patients seek medical attention late. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need to
explore alternative pharmacological approaches targeting later stages of ALF, such as by inhibiting progression
of injury or by boosting the compensatory liver regeneration. Growth factor receptors, MET and EGFR, are
considered essential for liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH), but their roles in the clinically
relevant model of APAP-induced liver injury (AILI) remain underexplored. Unlike PH, massive liver injury and
inflammation during AILI greatly govern its pathophysiology and our previous studies have shown that roles of
these growth factor receptors in AILI model cannot be presumed identical to that known in regeneration of a
healthy liver after PH. In fact, our previously published study indicated an unexpected role of early EGFR
activation in aggravating AILI, in contrast to its conventional role in hepatocyte proliferation during
regeneration. We found that EGFR activation correlated with the severity of injury and treatment with EGFR
inhibitor (canertinib) almost completely abolished AILI in mice. Contrary to EGFR, our preliminary studies
indicate that MET is involved in actively suppressing progression of liver injury during AILI, apart from its role
in promoting liver regeneration. Thus, our overarching hypothesis is that EGFR and MET play diametrically
opposite roles in acute liver injury after APAP overdose, as opposed to their conventionally known and
functionally similar roles in hepatocyte proliferation. In contrast to their similar roles in liver regeneration,
MET directly suppresses and, paradoxically, EGFR aggravates acute liver injury in the AILI model. To establish
the paradigm-shift proposed by our initial findings, our specific aims 1 and 2 will comprehensively investigate
the roles of EGFR and MET, respectively, in liver injury and compensatory regeneration after APAP overdose,
utilizing hepatocyte-specific knock out and receptor-activation strategies. Further, we will investigate the
mechanisms underlying these novel roles of growth factor receptors in AILI. For therapeutic relevance, the
effects of clinically-approved EGFR inhibitor (afatinib) and interventions targeting MET will be investigated on
AILI, especially focusing on clinically relevant late intervention, when NAC is ineffective. Lastly, for human
relevance, we will also investigate the effects of our interventions and validate mechanisms in well-
characterized primary human hepatocyte model of AILI. These studies will not only elucidate regenerative role
of MET and EGFR, for the first time in a clinically significant ALF model but will also reveal insights into the
novel aspect of growth factor receptor biology related to acute liver injury. Moreover, successful completion of
these studies will be useful to determine the potential of repurposing a clinically available EGFR inhibitor
and/or interventions targeting MET to treat APAP-induced ALF."

Project 5 (P5) will address Center Aim 2 by characterizing mediodorsal (MD) nucleus and pulvinar (PUL) circuit
dysfunction in schizophrenia across levels of analysis, including functional connectivity with cortex, localized
activation during cognition, and behavior. The structure, connectivity, and function of the thalamus are abnormal
in schizophrenia. Thalamic abnormalities are especially pronounced in the MD nucleus and PUL. How MD and
PUL dysfunction contributes to the symptoms and associated features of schizophrenia is largely unknown
posing a significant challenge to developing effective interventions. One of the motivating factors of this Center
application is that the MD and PUL are not only causally involved in cognition, but anatomically and functionally
heterogenous. Consequently, dissecting higher-order thalamocortical circuits across levels of analysis is
essential for understanding the functional consequences of thalamic dysfunction in schizophrenia and identifying
targets for intervention. Working synergistically with P4 resting-state fMRI studies in healthy individuals and
supporting by Core C, Aim 1 will use innovative methods to test the hypothesis that functional connectivity of
MD and PUL subdivisions is abnormal in schizophrenia and further determine if the alterations are diffuse, or
isolated to specific MD and PUL subdivisions. Informed by basic neuroscience discoveries motivating P1 and
P2, Aim 2 will characterize dorsal and ventral pulvinar circuits during attention in schizophrenia. Deficits in
attention are ubiquitous in schizophrenia and may serve as a viable biomarker. We hypothesize that such deficits
may be caused by aberrant engagement of the PUL in regulating information flow across the dorsal and ventral
visual streams. We will test this hypothesis by acquiring simultaneous brain (fMRI) and behavior measurements
in patients and healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use a variant of the Center’s Hierarchical Decision Making (HDM)
paradigm to investigate MD-PFC pathways for regulating cortical excitation/inhibition. Animal models developed
by P3 indicate that resolving sensory uncertainty during decision making depends on different MD-PFC pathways:
one for suppressing noise (conflict) by increasing cortical inhibition, the other for enhancing signal (sparseness)
by decreasing inhibition. Building on preliminary behavioral data with leaders of P3 implicating impaired decision
making under sensory conflict, we will determine if schizophrenia is associated with impaired decision making
under uncertainty when task cues are sparse (low signal), conflicting (high noise), or both. Furthermore, we will
test the hypothesis that MD dysfunction is associated with impaired attentional control under uncertainty in
schizophrenia and determine whether MD dysfunction is more prominent in sparseness- or conflict-based
uncertainty. Core B will provide critical support for modelling behavioral data (Aims 2, 3) to allow cross-species
comparisons. The overall outcomes of P5 will provide the foundation for developing interventions for correcting
thalamocortical dysfunction and cognitive impairment in schizophrenia."
10819540,"Project summary
The aim of Core B is to provide an adequately detailed biophysical model of thalamocortical interactions to allow
the model to guide experiments of the Thalamus Conte Center, especially Projects P1-P3. The Center is
proposing to understand the function of higher-order thalamus in tasks involving attention and decision making,
particularly when there are uncertainties in sensory input or context. The Center hypothesis is that higher-order
thalamic nuclei in the primate brain, particularly the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and the pulvinar (PUL), play a
fundamental role in integrating and gating cortical activity and coordinating information flow across large-scale
cortical networks. Indeed, we propose that an understanding of the functioning of cortical cognitive networks in
the primate brain is not possible without understanding the interactions of cortex and thalamus. The experiments
to be done in P1-P3 involve non-human primates and tree shrews in a way that will constrain circuit models of
both dynamics and function. In addition, the group will also investigate animal models of schizophrenia (SZ)
(P3). In both the normal and SZ animal models, the experimentalist will gather information about brain rhythms
and spike timing need for the model. Our model will also be informed by network data from healthy humans (P4)
and Schizophrenia patients (P5). The computational model to be constructed in core B will use the detailed
physiological framework of Hodgkin-Huxley equations, constrained by currently available and future data. The
model will be built with multiple modules, each with multiple cell types, each producing multiple kinds of dynamics
that can themselves change rhythmically on a slow time scale. Each of these modules can change with effects
of neuromodulation, and the functional connections among them are also subject to modulation. Such a complex
model needs to be highly constrained, and we will make use of a novel methodology in which each module is
constrained by known physiology plus the multiple dynamical behaviors that it must produce with different inputs.
The anatomy of the model is partly motivated by earlier work with Kastner explaining the roles of multiple brain
rhythms in a spatial attention task and showing that those frequencies are functionally important. Indeed, the
current work, in which the tasks require us to consider similarly complex interactions, raises the very general and
important question: Is such biological complexity important for function, and in what ways? We hypothesize that
the known complex rhythms are essential to function; in the proposed work of Core B, we aim to spell out in what
ways those dynamics are important in the context of tasks requiring attention, decision making and rule changing.
In Aim 1, we investigate the effects of cortical dynamics on pulvinar and MD. In Aim 2, we consider the changes
in dynamics when there is uncertainty about which is the cue and there is switching in the rule. In Aim3, in the
context of schizophrenia, we consider how dysfunctions in thalamic rhythms and in inhibitory function can lead
to cognitive deficits, using the work of Aims 1 and 2. This work is expected to contribute to answers to the
question of why the higher order thalamus is needed for cognition."

Respiratory viral infections such as influenza and coronaviruses are frequent causes of acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), a disabling condition with a mortality up to 46%. While supportive interventions have reduced
the overall mortality of ARDS, severe cases requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation remain common, and
many cases are complicated by the development of fibrosis in the lung. Post-viral pulmonary fibrosis can lead to
chronic disability due to respiratory dysfunction, exercise intolerance and disabling symptoms such as shortness
of breath and cough. Endothelial injury and dysfunction contribute to the severity of ARDS, persistence of lung
injury, and dysregulated tissue repair. Currently there are no therapies to prevent the development of post-viral
pulmonary fibrosis, and in fact supportive mechanical ventilation may further perpetuate pathological endothelial
injury and worsen fibrotic outcomes.
The sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) signaling axis on endothelial cells (EC) is a key
modulator of endothelial function, including a regulatory role in vascular permeability. However, the role of
S1PR1 during the fibroproliferative phase of pulmonary viral infection induced ARDS has not been well explored.
Specifically, cross talk between EC and lung fibroblasts, key effector cells in the development of pulmonary
fibrosis because of their production of extracellular matrix and their ability to contract and distort tissue
architecture, has not been defined. Reversing endothelial dysfunction and restoring pulmonary vascular integrity
via augmentation of EC S1PR1 after viral infection could have great therapeutic value by preventing the
development of post-viral pulmonary fibrosis.
Our preliminary results demonstrate that persistent loss of endothelial S1PR1 is deleterious during influenza A
virus (IAV) infection, resulting in increased vascular permeability and increased pulmonary fibrosis. We
hypothesize that IAV infection induced lung injury induces loss of EC S1PR1, leading to altered EC-fibroblast
cross talk which drives fibrosis. Furthermore, we propose that augmenting EC S1PR1 expression in the context
of IAV infection will lead to the development of a novel anti-fibrotic strategy. We will use endothelial specific gain-
of-function and loss-of-function mice in an IAV infection model to determine how IAV infection drives sustained
reduction of EC S1PR1 (Aim 1), how EC S1PR1 affects transcriptomic signatures and cross talk with fibroblasts
after IAV infection (Aim 2), and how augmentation of EC S1PR1 can be used in a therapeutic manner to prevent
post-IAV pulmonary fibrosis (Aim 3). A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and sequelae of EC
dysfunction after IAV and the effects on subsequent fibroproliferation will lead to novel therapeutics to prevent
this debilitating complication of pulmonary viral infections."

Giardia lamblia is the causative agent of giardiasis, a gastrointestinal illness with symptoms including diarrhea
and malabsorption. Chronic infections can lead to long term growth retardation or death in infants, with a recent
estimate of global incidence of 280 million symptomatic cases per year. However, a substantial number of clinical
infections are resistant to currently available treatments, especially metronidazole. We have shown that specific
inhibitors of methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) representing 3 scaffolds in an available ~600 library prevent
growth in wild-type and metronidazole resistant G. lamblia strains. The molecular mechanism of action seems
to be the disruption of G. lamblia protein synthesis due to inhibition of GlMetRS enzyme activities. Proof of
principle compound 1717 has decent oral bioavailability and is an effective treatment in a mouse model of
giardiasis, showing complete clearance of G. lamblia after 3 days. This research proposal will capitalize on these
encouraging preliminary data to develop compounds as novel anti-giardia drugs for alternative or complementary
treatment of giardiasis. We have selected 18 compounds representing 3 distinct scaffolds based on chemical
functional group diversity, GlMetRS IC50 ≤50nM, G. lamblia trophozoite EC50 ≤3000nM, and a selectivity index
of ≥ 15 defined as CC50/EC50, for toxicity in HepG2 cell cultures. Preliminary data showed that the double-ring
linker series tends to have better selectivity when compared to the other two series. We will therefore focus on
the double-ring linker compounds. Since the pharmacokinetic correlations for effective anti-Giardia
chemotherapy have not been well established, we will use these compounds to define the PK/PD properties
necessary for optimum in vivo efficacy in Aim 1. Also, in Aim 1, we will determine structural activity relationships
and select compounds with high potency against GlMetRS and multiple G. lamblia strains. In Aim 2, we will
determine: static vs. cidal properties, rate of killing, propensity for acquired resistance and initial safety liabilities
of the compounds. A combination of structure-based design, empirical SAR-driven approaches and automated
quantitative tomography of G. lamblia will be used in Aim 3 to guide medicinal chemistry optimization of double-
ring linker scaffold for improved efficacy and PK/ADMET properties, while addressing potential safety issues.
We will determine potential toxicity and off-target effects of GlMetRS inhibitors in vitro and in rodent models. The
compounds will be tested for hERG liabilities and CYP inhibition, as well as against the mutagenesis model and
a safety panel of human receptors and ion channels. This will set the stage in Aim 4 for dose finding experiments
in efficacy models, final toxicology studies, additional resistance studies and metronidazole combination studies.
The proposed work will complete many of the steps necessary for selecting a preclinical candidate that will
facilitate innovative, shorter course therapy for G. lamblia-associated chronic asymptomatic diseases, diarrhea,
growth retardation, and poor cognitive function. The product will provide a great public health benefit."
10811767,"Nuclear receptors (NRs) influence development and physiology by controlling patterns of gene expression via ligand-directed chromatin modifications. The resultant induced epigenomic state mobilizes networks of genes to engender unique cell functions and physiology. This proposal extends on previous studies that elucidated the roles of the NRs PPARd and ERRa/g in context-specific transcriptional activities that reprogram skeletal muscle metabolism and physiology to increase endurance performance. A central focus of exercise physiology has been the functional association of induced transcriptional programs with changes in histone acetylation, including understanding how the activation of PPARd and ERRa/g and their coactivator PGC1a drive oxidative
metabolic programs that lead to increased endurance performance. In contrast, little is known about the potential contributions of repressive programs and the expected histone deacetylation. BCL6 was identified as a novel, exercise-responsive transcriptional repressor in both humans and mice, however its importance in muscle physiology has not been explored. Interestingly, an interaction between BCL6 and PPARd, the master regulator of fatty acid substrate utilization, has been shown in other cell types suggesting that BCL6 may have dual roles in skeletal muscle; effecting transcriptional outcomes through its direct chromatin binding as well as indirectly by modulating the PPARd transcriptional program. This proposal utilizes pharmacologic strategies
and muscle-specific genetic knockout mouse models in combination with epigenetic and transcriptional mapping techniques to delineate BCL6’s function in exercise physiology. In Aim 1, the BCL6 transcriptional complex will be characterized using state-of-the-art APEX2 proximity labeling techniques in WT and PPARd KO primary skeletal muscle myotubes with and without pharmacologic agents targeting BCL6. Changes in the BCL6 complex in response to ligands will be correlated with altered epigenomic and gene expression states to associate specific complexes with functional outcomes. In Aim 2, the contributions of BCL6 to exercise-induced physiologic and transcriptional changes will be determined using genetic (muscle-specific Bcl6 knockout mice)
and pharmacologic (BCL6 inhibitor) loss-of-function mouse models, while related studies in muscle-specific Ppard knockout mice will distinguish the PPARd dependent and independent effects. Lastly, Aim 3 will exploit the advances of the CUT&RUN technology to map the BCL6 chromatin binding sites in sedentary and exercised skeletal muscle. Combined with the changes induced in PPARd and ERRg binding, in addition to alterations in histone regulatory marks, these studies will molecularly dissect the competing repressive and activating transcriptional programs in muscle. Moreover, associating these findings with the transcriptional complexes identified in Aim 1 and the transcriptomics data from Aim 2 will provide a comprehensive view of BCL6-driven transcriptional repression and its contribution to transcriptional regulation of skeletal muscle in
both the resting and exercise state."

The ultimate goal of this project is to understand the interplay of cell signaling and RNA processing in shaping
cellular gene expression and function. The specific focus of the current funding period is in unraveling the
regulatory connections that exist between signaling pathways and RNA processing events, and the RNA
binding proteins (RBPs) that maintain these connections. Decades of work have revealed that cell signaling
pathways are central to controlling cellular function in response to environmental cues. Similarly, all of the
steps of RNA processing, including alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation and regulated mRNA
stability, can be regulated to dictate the identity or abundance of the final mRNA and proteins. Historically,
most work on the impact of cell signaling on gene expression has focused on the regulation of transcription.
Therefore, how cell signaling impinges on the various mechanisms of RNA processing, and conversely, how
RNA processing shapes the cellular response to environmental challenges, remain largely unexplored areas of
research that are critical to our broad understanding of cellular activity. T cell activation provides an excellent a
model system for complex cellular responses, as multiple signaling pathways are triggered downstream of
antigen engagement and act, individually and cooperatively, to induce T cell effector functions. It has been well
documented that T cell activation leads to changes in alternative splicing, polyadenylation and mRNA stability.
Moreover, changes in these RNA processing events impact additional signaling pathway such as apoptosis
and inflammation, which are critical secondary responses to T cell activation. However, many questions
regarding the regulatory connections between RNA processing and signaling remain, including identifying the
RBPs that link signaling to RNA processing, understanding the functional impact of processing events
triggered by one signal on other pathways, and determining how individual RBPs coordinate multiple steps of
RNA processing. This proposal will address these unanswered questions of signal-induced RNA processing by
leveraging recent results and systems to determine how alternative splicing controls apoptosis and interferon
responsive signaling in activated T cells, the proteins that control alternative polyadenylation and mRNA
stability in response to T cell signaling, and a potential new mechanism for the regulation of translation by the
RBP CELF2. Together these studies will provide novel insight regarding the interplay of signaling and RNA
processing in shaping cellular function during T cell activation. Since the signaling pathways studied here are
related to cell growth and death, the insight gained in these studies will be broadly applicable far beyond T cell
biology. In addition, these studies will reveal new paradigms regarding the molecular mechanisms by which
RBPs coordinately control multiple steps in RNA processing. Thus, results from these experiments will
significantly increase the general understanding of the mechanisms that control proteome expression and
cellular function in response to environmental cues."

 Human milk contains essential nutrients and bioactives that are transferred to the nursing infant in what
was once considered in a linear manner. Though now there is considerable evidence that human milk directs
early establishment of the microbiome through molecules such as oligosaccharides that modulate specific
microbial populations. Microbial communities that colonize the gastrointestinal tract enter into a commensal
relationship with their host potentially impacting physiology. Accordingly, nitrogen bound in urea is delivered at
relatively high concentrations in breast milk and may be liberated for utilization by the host and commensals by
microbial urease activity. We hypothesize that urea nitrogen salvaging (UNS) is a key syntrophic feature of
host-microbial interactions early in life. This may be of particular importance to infants in this critical stage of
development, or in host populations where dietary nitrogen is limiting. This hypothesis will be addressed
experimentally by evaluating and characterizing the metabolic capacity for infant-associated commensals to
utilize urea and transform it to a usable form by their host. Moreover, we propose to study infant microbiome-
mediated UNS modeled in an in vitro model to identify community-level phenomena. By understanding the
impact to community structure and function by urea metabolism, we will define hallmarks of a microbiome that
performs UNS efficiently.
 This study investigates a poorly understood and hypothetical host-microbial interaction with implications to
nitrogen homeostasis early in development. The inter-kingdom UNS pathway may be of critical importance to
infants in general or in certain nutritional contexts. In addition, this study further defines what constitutes a
protective infant microbiome based on aggregate community function. This would potentially inform diagnostics
to assess UNS capacity as well as develop interventions to correct suboptimal UNS. As such, purposeful
modulation of UNS would increase the repertoire of tools to direct microbiome function while personalizing for
life stage, diet, and/or host phenotype."

Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is a therapeutic cure for hematological malignancies, metabolic
disorders, and inherited and acquired bone marrow (BM) failure. However, myeloablative conditioning regimens
routinely used for transplantation cause acute and long-term BM damage, leading to impaired blood and immune
cell production, often causing fatal consequences. Although myeloablative irradiation/chemotherapy-induced
defects in the BM microenvironment/niche have been reported, the underlying mechanism(s) are not well
understood. The other crucial limiting factor for HSC transplantation is an inadequate number/quality of
transplantable HSPC collected from patients or donors. Emerging evidence suggests the pivotal role of neuronal
signals in the BM niche and HSC function. Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication associated with
radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Thus, a deficit of neuronal signals in the BM can impair hematopoietic
reconstitution. We recently reported that neuropeptide Y (NPY), one of the most abundant neurotransmitters,
regulates hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) release into circulation by regulating BM vascular
gateway function. Preliminary data showed that steady-state, NPY knockout (KO) mice have fewer HSPC and
BM niche endothelial cell (EC) and mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) than wild-type (WT) mice. Interestingly,
total body irradiation (TBI) reduces NPY levels in mouse BM, accompanied by a scarcity of EC and MSC.
Furthermore, we found that BM EC and MSC from NPY KO mice produce higher reactive oxygen species (ROS)
than WT mice. Also, NPY supplementation enhances HSPC ex vivo expansion. Based on these observations,
we hypothesize that NPY is required for BM niche regulation and HSPC homeostasis, and cytotoxic stress-
induced deficit of NPY signals in the BM impairs NPY-regulated BM niche extrinsic and HSPC intrinsic
mechanisms leading to hematopoietic dysfunction. This hypothesis will be tested in three aims herein:
Specific aim 1 will investigate whether myeloablative irradiation-mediated deficit of NPY signals in the BM
causes acute and chronic defects in the BM niche and impairs hematopoietic regeneration. Using mouse HSC
transplantation models, we will evaluate the relationship between NPY signals and irradiation-induced structural
and functional defects in the BM niche and HSPC.
Specific aim 2 will identify the mechanism(s) via which NPY signals promote BM niche restoration and
hematopoietic regeneration. We will use molecular and functional analysis to explore how NPY signals control
oxidative stress and vascular integrity in the BM niche constituents.
Specific aim 3 will investigate whether NPY supplementation during ex vivo HSPC expansion can improve
hematopoietic engraftment after transplantation.
The proposed studies will shed new light on how stress-induced neuropathy contributes to stem cell niche
damage and blood stem cell defects and identify a potential therapeutic target to improve HSC transplantation."
10784740,"Studying semantic processing during language comprehension in humans at the
single-cellular level
Humans are capable of communicating extraordinarily rich and nuanced meanings through language. This
capacity surpasses that of all other animal species. Yet, despite a growing understanding of the network of
brain areas that supports semantic processing, the precise derivation of linguistic meaning in neural tissue at
the cellular-level and over the temporal scales of action potentials remains largely unknown. Over the past
several years, our collaborative group has developed unique approaches that have allowed us to record from
individual neurons in the language-dominant prefrontal and temporal cortex in participants performing
structured linguistic tasks. Here, we will use this extraordinarily rare opportunity together with our group’s
unique combined expertise in linguistic theory, human intraoperative neurophysiology, single-neuronal
recordings and computational modeling in order to study in detail, for the first time, how semantic
information is encoded at a cellular-level during speech and the degree to which single neurons respond
selectivity to specific semantic domains, whether semantic information can be robustly decoded from neural
activity, the extent to which it can be generalized across linguistic materials and the process by which these
neuronal activities maps onto the fine-grained semantic relationships between individual words. Using
structured linguistic manipulations and violations and by employing information-theoretic techniques, we
will also crucially examine whether certain neurons in humans respond selectively to linguistic compared to
non-linguistic information, how they engaged in lexico-semantic or syntactic processes, how they track the
real-time context-dependent inferred meanings of individual words during speech and how these mixed
representations and computations are distributed within frontal and temporal cortical populations in the
language-dominant hemisphere. Taken together, this novel cross-institutional, inter-disciplinary
collaborative effort promises to provide a fundamental new platform by which to begin studying the basic
cellular mechanisms that underlie human language and unprecedented new insight into the cellular-level
processing and representation of linguistic meaning during language comprehension in humans."
10784743,"We are in the midst of an epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The discovery of new pathways of energy metabolism is critically needed to address this pressing medical problem. Using untargeted metabolomics, we have identified a new pathway of energy expenditure mediated by family of bioactive lipids called N-acyl amino acids. Certain N-acyl amino acids and stimulate mitochondrial respiration by promoting proton leak. We have also de-orphanized a novel upstream enzyme, PM20D1 (peptidase M20 domain containing 1), that functions as an extracellular N-acyl amino acid synthase/hydrolase. Pharmacological or genetic elevation of circulating N-acyl amino acids increases energy expenditure, reduces adiposity, and improves glucose homeostasis in mouse models of diet-induced obesity. However, we are still early in our understanding of N-acyl amino acids. What remains unknown is how N-acyl amino acids promote proton conductance across the inner mitochondrial membrane, what other extracellular mechanisms regulate N- acyl amino acid levels, and whether this pathway could be useful for the treatment of obesity-associated disorders. Answers are critically needed to understand the biology and therapeutic potential of this energy expenditure pathway in metabolic disease. The long-term goal of this project is to harness energy expenditure pathways for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The overall objective of this proposal is to mechanistically dissect the regulators of the N-acyl amino acid pathway and to assess the therapeutic potential of these bioactive lipids. Our central hypothesis is that N-acyl amino acid bioactivity is regulated by both intracellular and extracellular proteins, and that this pathway can be pharmacologically leveraged for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. We will test this hypothesis via three Specific Aims: 1) Determine how N-acyl amino acids stimulate uncoupled respiration; 2) Determine the mechanisms that control circulating N-acyl amino acid levels; and 3) Evaluate the bioactivity of synthetic N-acyl amino acid analogs in diet-induced obesity mouse models. Successful completion of this proposal will provide a detailed, mechanistic understanding of the regulation and function of N-acyl amino acids in energy metabolism, as well as a pharmacological evaluation of this pathway for the treatment of obesity-associated dis- eases such as type 2 diabetes."

The retina conveys visual information to the brain through retinal ganglion cells whose axons make up the optic
nerve. There are many different types of retinal ganglion cells that in parallel convey a different component of
vision, such as detail, color, direction, or intensity. Most retinal ganglion cells receive a processed version
photoreceptor output, through synapses in the retina. Some retinal ganglion cells contain their own photopigment
(melanopsin) and respond directly to light. Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) send their
axons to at least 16 distinct central brain regions and influence a wide range of behaviors such as circadian
entrainment and pupil reflex, sleep, body temperature, and mood.
This proposal seeks to examine functional subtypes of ipRGCs, their location and density in the retina, and the
light response properties that differentiate functional groups. Preliminary data indicates some ipRGC types can
be divided into functional subtypes based on their mosaic spacing and the expression of unique mRNA, and Cre.
We hypothesize ipRGC subtypes are restricted to sub-regions of retina and ipRGCs within these subtypes differ
in their anatomical spacing, the neurotransmitters they release at central synapses, and the specific light stimuli
they respond to. We have identified unique subtypes of ipRGCs with restricted to the dorsal retina that express
inhibitory proteins and are spaced evenly across the retina, indicating they align in functional groups. In this
proposal, we will map the locations of individual ipRGC subtypes across the entire retina to build a spatial map
of their dendrites and how they overlap with each other. We will test ipRGCs for unique mRNA expression
patterns and use central brain injections to label them from distinct brain regions and estimate the total number
of ipRGC subtypes. We will use multielectrode array recordings to record from thousands of ipRGCs in response
to a detailed array of light stimuli and use unbiased cluster analysis to define their functional groups."

We will accelerate health equity among underserved Black youth in a region with the fourth highest HIV incidence
nationally. Shelby County, Tennessee (TN; Memphis) is a Phase I priority jurisdiction for the U.S. Ending the
HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative, where Black youth with HIV (BYWH) suffer comparatively worse HIV outcomes:
half of all BYWH in Memphis are appointment non-adherent, representing a major threat to HIV viral suppression,
morbidity, and disease transmission. Psychological trauma, including racial trauma, is a critical and understudied
mechanism driving a multitude of HIV-related disparities that will only be eliminated through multi-level solutions.
At the patient-level, YWH endure high levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (47%), with racial trauma
intensifying experiences among Black youth; at the personnel-level, repeated trauma exposures associated with
HIV care provision contribute to vicarious trauma and degrades professional quality of life. At the clinic-level,
trauma sequalae thwart patient-provider relationships and trust, which contributes to treatment fatigue,
disengagement, and viral failure. Trauma-Informed HIV care (TIHC) is an evidence-based intervention (EBI) that
improves multi-level outcomes (e.g., patient appointment adherence and personnel professional quality of life)
by ensuring institutional health practices adequately Recognize and Respond to trauma and Resist Re-
traumatization for all. Though the Memphis EHE plan cites TIHC implementation as critical to advancing local
goals, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital’s HIV clinic, primary care provider for BYWH in the area, has not
implemented TIHC. We have developed this proposal with St. Jude to support enhanced TIHC for youth (TIHC-
Y) implementation in their HIV care system. We will conduct an exploratory, sequential mixed methods study
through the following three aims: 1) Adapt our TIHC-Y to enhance access to care for BYWH and professional
quality of life for HIV care providers; 2) Implement and evaluate adapted TIHC-Y with HIV clinic personnel; and
3) Conduct a pilot trial of adapted TIHC-Y with St. Jude patients. This innovative and highly significant research
is wholly consistent with NIH high priority areas of research to reduce health disparities in treatment outcomes
of those living with HIV and training of workforce conducting high priority HIV-related research. By the end of the
5-year grant period, K01 candidate will have received extensive career development in the areas of
implementation science, mixed methods design, antiracist interventions, and health equity research, enabling
the development of a programmatic line of research to advance EHE goals and resulting in at least 10 first-
authored publications. We will have also submitted an R-level grant to support the scale out of the multi-level
and culturally responsive TIHC-Y intervention. There is strong rationale to support the current TIHC-Y
intervention and proposed research methods as meaningful approaches to addressing disparities across a wide
range of areas, including chronic diseases."
10757745,"People living with HIV (PLWH) have a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) compared
to their HIV negative counterparts. However, the underlying mechanisms that drive this increased CVD risk
remain elusive. Extracellular vesicles (EVs)/exosomes are released by all cells and widely distributed in
plasma, urine, and other biological fluids. EVs contain diverse bioactive molecules, including mRNAs,
microRNAs (miRs), proteins, and lipids, which can be transferred to target cells altering their functionality.
The cargo of EVs reflects the pathophysiological states of the host cells. It is conceivable that the latent HIV
reservoir established during early infection, long-term exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and chronic
immune activation/inflammation (referred to as HIV positivity for grant writing purpose) may impact host
cells, particularly those in the peripheral blood, altering the release and the cargo of plasma EVs. These EVs
in turn may serve as information vehicles for cell-to-cell communication, affecting cells of the arterial wall,
including endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), as well as endothelial progenitor cells
(EPCs) in the bone marrow, promoting atherogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we fractionated plasma from
PLWH on ART with undetectable viral load into plasma EVs (HIVposEVs) and plasma-depleted of EVs
(HIVplasmadepEVs) and injected these fractions into atherogenic apoE-/- mice. Remarkably, HIVposEVs, but not
HIVplasmadepEVs, increased atherosclerosis plaque burden compared to EVs isolated from HIV negative
subjects (HIVnegEVs) and PBS. These changes were accompanied by increased senescence and apoptosis
of ECs and SMCs in the arterial wall and impaired viability and functionality of bone marrow EPCs. These
exciting data support the hypothesis that circulating EVs from PLWH reconstitute the effects of HIV positivity
(without active HIV infection) on atherosclerosis. RNA-seq in HIVposEVs and HIVnegEVs revealed differential miR
profiles. The target genes of EV-miRs overrepresented in PLWH are enriched in cardiovascular pathology
pathways. We have engineered tailored EVs (TEVs) that are loaded with the antagomirs for let-7b-5p and
miR103a-2, two candidate EV-miRs overrepresented in HIVposEVs by transducing mesenchymal stromal cells.
These TEVs counteracted the effects of HIVposEVs on the accelerated senescence of EPCs, whereas let-7b-
5p overexpressing EVs recapitulated, in part, the effects of HIVposEVs. Furthermore, EPCs overexpressing
HMGA2 (a top let-7b-5p target gene) lacking the 3'UTR (resistant to miR regulation) showed protection
similar to miRZip-let-7b TEVs against HIVposEVs-induced senescence. In this proposal, we will determine if
TEVs engineered to modulate key HIVposEVs-associated miRs counteract the effects of the chronic
inflammation and immune activation, ART, and latent HIV reservoir associated with HIV positivity on
atherosclerosis development. In addition, we will further dissect the mechanisms underlying the adverse
effect of HIV positivity on the cardiovascular system by examining the effects of HIVposEVs and/or TEVs on the
functionality and transcriptome of ECs, SMCs and EPCs. We will identify putative miR-mRNA pathways.
Importantly, we will validate our mouse findings in EPC samples from PLWH using TEVs, direct miR
antagonism, and target gene overexpression approaches."
10869878,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Primary lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with approximately 150,000 deaths
yearly in the United States. When symptoms arise, the lung cancer survival rate at five years is a dismal 17%.
Lung cancer screening with low-dose CT has been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer among high-
risk patients as the cancer is typically caught early, in stage IA. Definitive diagnosis requires tissue sampling,
and despite risks of pneumothorax, sampling is often performed by percutaneous transthoracic lung biopsies
under CT guidance. Since sampling can cause immediate perilesional hemorrhage and obscure views of the
lesion, there is little room for error. However, current procedural challenges, involving translating the patient in-
and-out of the bore repetitively for frequent freehand needle adjustments and advancements, introduce errors,
take significant time, cost, and confers ionizing radiation and risk of complications to the patient.
 The purpose of this project is to develop an autonomous needle biopsy procedure performed under
artificially intelligent robot guidance, optimizing for patient safety and targeting accuracy. The approach
involves (i) a highly dexterous, force-sensitive redundant robot design with an active needle placer that
operates inside the CT scanner, and can articulate and steer needles for any thoracic approach or patient
position; (ii) an artificially intelligent planner that finds new, less traumatic, and safer approaches to biopsy
lesions in a patient-specific manner, and (iii) closed-loop CT-image feedback control to precisely steer needles
to suspect lesions. The work of this project is to be carried out via the following Specific Aims: (1) develop the
force sensitive robot based on our previous robotic designs and validate on real human cases for reachability
and safety analysis, (2) develop metrics and algorithms for planning needle biopsy approaches in a patient-
specific way, and (3) develop high-fidelity breathing phantoms across biologically relevant variables and
compare the automated robotic approach to freehanded needle placement a user study.
 The proposed approach offers a solution that could significantly broaden the approach direction and
positioning of needles for biopsies. The semi-autonomy provides significant value by computing a variety of
factors in planning the approach that optimizes accuracy and safety, including patient anatomy, safety from
sensitive structures, and depth of insertions --- all of which can also have a significant effect on patient health
during screening, who are already have compromised pulmonary status or have elevated risk of acute
pneumothorax. Finally, the integration of machine learning, automation, and robotics reduces the variation
between clinicians, leverages population data to make data-backed informed plans, and can reach super-
human precision while reducing procedure time and ionizing imaging. Our long-term goal is to evaluate how
the semi-autonomous approach can be advantageous to, more effective than, and/or affordable to traditional
manual biopsy approaches. The outcome of this project will be a validated system ready for a clinical study."

As we enter the fifth decade of the HIV pandemic, innovations in HIV vaccine research and development have
moved us closer than ever to the availability of effective vaccines that could end HIV acquisition. Unfortunately,
vaccine hesitancy (i.e., delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite availability of vaccination services)
poses a major threat to the future uptake of a proven vaccine. Globally, people of African descent have been
disproportionately burdened by the HIV pandemic, facing higher morbidity and mortality. In the United States,
the convergence of racism, mistrust in the healthcaresystem, inadequate community engagement,and concerns
regarding vaccine literacy may exacerbate vaccine hesitancy, reducing future uptake within this population. To
prepare for an inevitable HIV vaccine, including those with partial efficacy, we need to field-test targeted
messaging campaigns that: are persuasive, counter vaccine-related myths and misinformation, come from
trusted sources, and are culturally relevant and impactful. Moreover, campaigns must leverage digital platforms
to which greater proportions of the population turn for critical health information. Guided by the Capability
Opportunity Motivation—Behavior and Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Frameworks, this study
will leverage participatory research methods, artificial intelligence, and infrastructure from ongoing HIV vaccine
research at Duke University to: 1) Identify preferences regarding HIV vaccine attributes and communication
strategies for African Americans in North Carolina using discrete choice experiments; 2) Develop and pilot
crowdsourced and deep learning interventions to assess acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary impact on HIV
vaccine literacy, confidence, and willingness; and 3) Evaluate the impact of a crowdsourced vs. a deep learning
computer animation intervention on HIV vaccine literacy, confidence, and willingness to vaccinate compared to
a control arm using a three-arm randomized experiment. The results of this study will: a) enable us to compare
outcomes associated with community-driven, community-engaged, and expert-driven interventions to promote
favorable attitudes towards an HIV vaccine; b) identify effective HIV vaccine promotion messages for African
Americans; c) inform guidelines informing the rollout and promotion of future novel vaccines."
10824299,"Advances in antiretroviral therapies (ART) have greatly improved the survival of people with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (PWH); yet, the leading cause of death in PWH across all ages is now
cardiovascular disease (CVD). While the pathogenesis of HIV-associated CVD is thought to be multifactorial
resulting from the interplay of traditional CVD risk factors, exposure to ART, chronic inflammation, and immune
activation that persists despite viral suppression; a comprehensive mechanistic framework is lacking to provide
further insights into the etiology of CVD in PWH. Importantly, the “female advantage” for CVD risk is attenuated
in the context of HIV, with an increase in MI and stroke risk reported in women when compared to men.
Inflammation is recognized as a central driving factor in CVD pathogenesis irrespective of HIV status but is
more pronounced in PWH. In a study of ART-suppressed PWH within the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical
Systems (CNICS) cohort, our team identified distinct biomarkers of inflammation that predicted inflammatory
related clinical events in a sex-specific manner. However, efficient therapies targeting inflammatory processes
are still lacking. Accumulating evidence suggests that the upstream initiation of inflammatory activity is
governed by products of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and that eicosanoids, the best-characterized
bioactive PUFA derivatives, play a role in CVD pathogenesis by modulating vascular tone, cellular
regeneration and thrombosis. The COX pathway involved in eicosanoid production is of particular clinical
relevance as it is the major target for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), used to treat pain, fever
and inflammation. Recent advances in mass spectrometry have allowed our team to quantify hundreds of
eicosanoids in the plasma of two non-HIV cohorts and detect specific pathways linked to CVD risk, some in a
sex-specific manner. However, the causal role of plasma eicosanoids in CVD pathogenesis in PWH has not
been elucidated. Therefore, our objective is to leverage CNICS cohort with adjudicated clinial events to
elucidate the role of eicosanoids in CVD risk in PWH. We hypothesize that eicosanoids serve as inflammatory
mediators of HIV-associated CVD pathogenesis and explain, at least in part, the sexual dimorphism seen in
CVD risk. We propose to 1. Characterize plasma eicosanoid profiles of PWH compared to matched non-HIV
controls and establish their relationship with CVD risk factors, HIV related factors (disease duration, viral load,
CD4 counts), sex and clinical events among 3,000 PWH; 2. Assess causal inference of eicosanoids on
cardiovascular events and identify unique genetic loci associated with eicosanoid profiles in PWH, and 3.
Integrate lipidomics, metabolomics, proteomics and genomics data with clinical information to detect novel
biological pathways and key drivers of cardiovascular risk in PWH and identify novel or repurposed intervention
drug targets. The proposed studies will guide future development of efficacious, potentially sex-stratified,
interventions for CVD in individuals with and without HIV."

The cell cycle is an ordered series of molecular events in a cell leading to division and production of two
daughter cells. This process is fundamental to the development of all multicellular organisms, which begin from
a single cell, the fertilized egg. Equally important for proper development though, is the slowing or stopping of
the cell cycle at the right places and times as cells, tissues and organs mature. In fact, the majority of cells in
multicellular organisms spend most of their existence in non-proliferating states, often referred to as cellular
quiescence or the G0 phase. In their non-dividing state, quiescent cells are metabolically active and carry out
critical physiological functions in tissues and organs. Despite the importance of G0, most studies of cell cycle
regulation have focused on rapidly dividing cells. Thus, it remains unclear how cells choose to enter G0 during
development, and why some cells can choose to leave G0 and later re-enter the cell cycle in response to
developmental signals, tissue damage, or nutrient availability while others cannot. It has become clear that
there are multiple states of G0, some that are readily reversible, and others that are permanent. Different
states of states may be controlled in distinct ways, both in the manner of cell cycle inhibition and in the
pathways used to initiate exit. The goal of the work described here is to understand how the cell cycle
machinery is controlled during the decision to exit the cell cycle, and how G0 can be modulated to be
more or less reversible in different contexts. This work impacts a wide range of biological questions, as the
proper control of quiescence is critical in development and tissue regeneration, but becomes disrupted in aging
and cancer."

 A significant fraction of the eukaryotic proteome is composed of integral membrane proteins, most of which
are inserted and assembled at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The diverse biophysical characteristics,
topology, posttranslational modifications, and activities of these membrane proteins necessitate distinct cellular
pathways and numerous components to ensure their proper biogenesis and function. The goal of this project
is to define a new mechanistic role of the zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24 in membrane protein
biology. ZMPSTE24 has long been a research focus in my laboratory and is important for human health and
longevity through its established role in the proteolytic processing of farnesylated prelamin A, precursor of the
nuclear scaffold protein lamin A. Defects in this processing step lead to premature aging (progeria) diseases.
However, an intriguing new function for ZMPSTE24 in viral defense was recently discovered by others and
surprisingly does not require its catalytic activity: ZMPSTE24 confers potent antiviral activity against many
enveloped viruses through its interaction with a class of small membrane proteins called interferon-induced
transmembrane proteins (IFITM1, 2, and 3). The IFITMs block virus-host cell fusion by a mechanism that
involves “rigidifying” host cell membranes. As is the case for IFITMs, the overexpression of ZMPSTE24
robustly protects cells from infection by enveloped viruses, and its proteolytic activity is not needed in this role.
Furthermore, depletion of ZMPSTE24 in cells and mice cause them to succumb to viral infection. These
findings place ZMPSTE24 at an important position in the cell’s first line of defense against viral infection, likely
through a general cell biological role.
 Here we hypothesize that ZMPSTE24 defines a central component in a known or new pathway for
membrane protein biogenesis (insertion, topology, stability/quality control, posttranslational
modification, or oligomerization), with IFITM3 as its substrate. Alternatively, ZMPSTE24 may facilitate
IFITM3’s membrane rigidifying function in some other way, directly by recruitment to IFITM3, or
indirectly by altering the composition or properties of the lipid bilayer. This project represents an exciting
new direction in my laboratory’s long-term studies of ZMPSTE24, inspired by the convergence of ZMPSTE24’s
newly discovered role in viral defense and the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the studies we propose also
relate to earlier research in my laboratory on membrane protein topology, trafficking, and ER quality control.
Deciphering the antiviral role of ZMPSTE24 via the IFITMs presents an intriguing puzzle that we are primed to
solve. We expect the studies proposed here will uncover a new fundamental role(s) for ZMPSTE24 in
membrane protein biogenesis or membrane lipid composition or fluidity. Furthermore, insight into the
mechanism whereby ZMPSTE24 enables IFITMs to block virus-host-cell fusion could ultimately be harnessed
to develop a novel anti-viral drug."

10864950,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Sex differences in the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD pathology burden have been
extensively studied; however, little is known about how AD pathology burden relates to clinical symptoms in
women versus men. Evidence of a cognitive advantage in the preclinical stage of AD, yet a two-times steeper
cognitive decline thereafter indicate that the question of sex differences in the clinical manifestation of AD
pathology is an important one. These sex differences have clinical implications in that our established
thresholds for AD clinical and biological markers used to diagnose and track disease were typically generated
without consideration for sex disparities. If women are better able to maintain what our current cognitive
thresholds consider “normal” cognition until a more advanced pathology state than men, then diagnosis of MCI
could be delayed, thus limiting the opportunity for early intervention. We hypothesize that sex differences in the
clinical translation of AD pathology results from a sex-specific balance of brain-related resilience/risk factors
that change with disease stage. Our proposal is particularly innovative in that we will first characterize sex
differences in how AD pathology relates to clinical symptoms by disease stage and then examine its
neurobiological underpinnings and clinical implications.
 We will leverage both in-vivo, longitudinal biomarker data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) and prospective neuropathological data in brain tissue from multiple Alzheimer’s Disease
Research Centers (ADRCs). Given their strong ties to AD pathology and the sex differences that our earlier
data show, we will examine the brain resilience/risk mechanisms of (1) PET-measured brain glucose
metabolism, (2) NMDAR density, a marker of glutamate neurotransmission, and (3) translocator protein 18kDA
(TSPO) levels, a marker of microglial activation. Specifically, Aim 1 will utilize ADNI data to examine sex
differences in trajectories of cognitive function and their relationship to longitudinal variation in AD pathology
(Aβ and Tau) and brain metabolism by AD stage. In Aim 2, we will conduct in vitro autoradiography in
hippocampal and cortical brain tissue of 60 normal control, 60 mild cognitive impairment and 60 AD dementia
autopsy cases to determine sex differences in plaque, tangle, NMDAR and TSPO density and how they relate
to each other and to antemortem cognitive function in each of the three diagnostic groups. In Aim 3, we will
take action on these sex differences by generating sex-specific cut-scores for cognitive tests commonly used in
MCI/AD diagnostic criteria with the optimal balance of sensitivity/specificity in detecting the presence of
clinically-significant levels of AD biomarkers/pathology. The public health benefits of our project would be
significant in that by understanding and accounting for sex disparities in our clinical and biomarker approaches
to AD diagnosis, we will improve clinical and biomarker approaches to disease diagnosis and tracking in both
sexes and possibly identify sex-specific therapeutic targets."

For replicated chromosomes to be segregated to two daughter cells accurately, the microtubule (MT)
cytoskeleton must be completely remodeled to form a bipolar spindle. A large, dynamic protein complex called
the kinetochore attaches replicated chromosomes to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles.
Proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment is vital for preservation of genomic integrity and prevention of
cancer and birth defects. Therefore, mitotic spindle assembly and kinetochore attachment must be well
coordinated. Challenging understanding of these processes and their coordination is the fact that mitotic
spindles and kinetochores are extremely complex molecular machines (kinetochores contain >60 proteins),
that they are targets of phosphoregulation by multiple protein kinases, and that they possess a striking range of
biochemical activities. Kinetochore activities include: (1) lateral MT binding, (2) translocation along the MT
lattice to the plus end, (3) conversion from lateral to end-binding, (4) association with dynamic MT ends while
tubulin subunits are exchanged, and (5) serving as force-coupling devices between chromosomes and MT plus
ends during anaphase A. Understanding how the kinetochore performs its various functions, the structural
underpinnings of these activities, and how these activities are regulated post-translationally, is far from
complete. A biochemical cell-lysate assay recently developed in the Barnes laboratory combines, for the first
time, two of the most powerful approaches for studies of microtubule dynamics: biochemical extract studies
and genetics. Dynamics of single microtubules and single kinetochores associated with these microtubules are
revealed and quantitatively analyzed by highly sensitive Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence microscopy.
Cell lysates synchronized to specific cell-cycle stages are made from budding yeast mutants of specific mitotic
proteins. Quantitative analysis of MT dynamics and kinetochore activities will establish how these parameters
are regulated in the cell cycle, and these studies will identify the specific proteins that carry out the specific
behaviors. Since mitosis is a highly conserved process, lessons learned from these studies are expected to
apply broadly. Unlike many other assays, this assay exclusively uses homologous sources of tubulin and
interacting proteins, avoiding artefacts that arise from species mismatch incompatibilities. Proposed studies
build upon recent unique observations of microtubule dynamics regulation and kinetochore dynamic activity in
this lysate system. The objectives are: (1) To investigate biochemical activities of intact kinetochores and their
regulation, and to relate kinetochore structure to function; and (2) To investigate how microtubule dynamics are
regulated through the cell cycle in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, focusing on Kar3 and Kip3 kinesins."

The replicative CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) helicase plays functional roles during passage through the G1-S
transition, DNA replication, and recovery from replicative stresses during S-phase. Evidence suggests that mis-
regulation of the human CMG (hCMG) helicase by oncogenic pathways can contribute to the development of
cancer through loss of cell cycle control and the creation of DNA damage. Although there is knowledge
regarding the subunit composition and general functionality of the hCMG helicase during cell cycle
progression, the molecular and biochemical mechanisms regulating the hCMG helicase directly by oncogenic
pathways are poorly understood. We and others have shown that two pivotal proteins involved in
tumorigenesis, Rb and Myc, are capable of directly regulating the assembly and activation of the hCMG
helicase. The tumor suppressor Rb physically binds to the hCMG via the Mcm7 subunit and inhibits the hCMG,
which we recently showed was derived from a specific N-terminal exon/peptide in Rb called Exon 7 (Ex7) that
is lost in familial inherited cancers. The oncoprotein Myc, traditionally thought to function as a transcription
factor, also interacts with the hCMG and directly (independent of transcription) stimulates helicase activity, in
part, by promoting chromatin access necessary for hCMG assembly. However, Myc also physically interacts
with the hCMG and must do so to stimulate its activity. We provide evidence that this interaction occurs
between Myc and the same C-terminal domain of Mcm7 that Rb contacts on the hCMG. This supports the
hypothesis that Rb and Myc both target the hCMG during its activation and provide countering roles in helicase
regulation, with Rb inhibiting and Myc stimulating hCMG activity, potentially via the same physical interaction
site on the hCMG. Such roles for Rb and Myc in controlling the hCMG offer intriguing novel explanations for
their opposing roles in tumorigenesis and cell cycle control. However, how Rb and Myc directly regulate the
hCMG at the biochemical level remains unknown. We propose to investigate these mechanistic questions
through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim1: How does Rb or Rb-Ex7 peptide inhibit the activity of the
purified hCMG helicase in vitro? Is ATP hydrolysis blocked, or hCMG elongation suppressed without ATP
interference? Specific Aim2: Does inhibition of the hCMG helicase by Rb derive from regulation of the Mcm10
or Ctf4 co-factors necessary for full hCMG functionality? Specific Aim3: How does Myc directly stimulate
hCMG activity? Does Myc counteract Rb-derived inhibition? Is Myc Box-II (MB-II) required for hCMG
stimulation?"
10847362,"PROJECT SUMMARY: A MOLECULAR TOOLKIT FOR CONTROLLING AND PROBING CELL JUNCTION-
ACTIN INTERACTIONS
Higher metazoans exhibit robust, yet dynamic connections between neighboring cells, leading to the exquisite
morphogenesis, vectorial transport, and resilient mechanical properties that define tissue. Spatially separated
junctions line individual epithelial membranes and are tasked with linking cells to one another and to the
underlying extracellular matrix. These junctions are composed of well-characterized membrane proteins, each
with unique functions: claudins create paracellular barriers; cadherins bind cells together; and integrins attach
cells to matrix. Despite unique classes of membrane proteins, different junctions all possess a common element,
the cytoskeleton, which resides on the cytosolic side of the contact. One cytoskeletal polymer in particular – actin
– appears indispensable for junction activity. While decades of elegant work have transformed our understanding
of the structure and binding characteristics of junctional membrane proteins, the question of how actin is involved
in cell junction formation, junction maintenance and repair, and junctional signaling remains unresolved.
 Actin filaments are ubiquitous throughout the cell as they contribute to cell shape, endocytosis, mitosis,
motility, and other critical phenomena. However, this wide distribution presents a fundamental problem when
studying actin – namely how to pinpoint the exact role actin filaments play in the process-of-interest. While actin-
targeted natural products and small molecules are widely used to disrupt filaments globally, they lack the
specificity needed to uncover the role of actin filaments locally at cell junctions. My research group is developing
a suite of molecular tools to both control and dissect actin interactions at cell junctions. In this way, we provide
researchers with new methods to turn-on and -off actin association and to probe actin’s role in adhesion and
cell-cell mechanics. These tools come in various molecular forms: i) protein-based switches, ii) small-molecule
molecular glues and inhibitors, and iii) synthetic cells, which can be applied to wide-ranging systems, such as
reconstituted membranes, cells, monolayers, tissues, and organisms, to illuminate and manipulate actin-
dependent processes.
 In my lab, we will harness these molecular tools to focus on three specific research directions in epithelial
biology, although we anticipate that the toolkit will benefit the greater biological community, including
biochemists, cell biologists and developmental biologists. First, we will focus on applying our tools to dissect
actin’s role during tight junction maturation and, ultimately, to modulate barrier function. Second, we will
investigate, in mechanistic detail, how actin potentiates integrin activation during focal adhesion formation.
Finally, we will assemble cells using actin switches to generate “synthetic tissues” with programmable and
toggleable properties, such as dynamic tissue permeability and adhesion. Broadly, this research program relies
on our diverse expertise in molecular engineering, basic membrane biology, and translational science to create
a virtuous cycle of innovation and discovery over the course of the MIRA award."
10805377,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: Approximately 3.4 million refugees and asylum-seekers are resettled in high-income countries, a
figure which is projected to rise given increased displacements of individuals seeking safety from war, conflict,
and natural disasters. Refugee mental health is a particularly salient issue in Sweden, which resettled the
highest number of Syrian refugees per capita following the onset of the Syrian conflict in 2011. Despite the
availability of publicly funded mental health services in Sweden, there is evidence of underutilization of these
services among displaced populations due to various structural barriers, including language, transportation,
trust, and cultural stigma.
Study Objective: To understand barriers and facilitators to mental health care utilization among refugee adults
in Sweden using national registry data and qualitative interviews, with a focus on the Syrian refugee
population. Lessons from the Swedish example can be applied to understanding barriers and facilitators to
mental health service utilization in other high-income countries, including the United States.
Specific Aims: 1) To compare mental health service utilization over time by refugee adults to non-refugee
migrant populations and to the native population in Sweden; 2) To identify predictors of mental health service
utilization over time among refugee adults in Sweden; and 3) To explore barriers and facilitators of mental
health care utilization among Syrian refugee adults in Sweden.
Approach: This study utilizes an explanatory, sequential mixed methods approach. Aims 1 and 2 will include
secondary data analysis of longitudinal data made available by Swedish national registries. Aim 1 will use Cox
proportional hazards modelling to identify rates in mental health service utilization using national inpatient and
outpatient registers. Aim 2 will use Cox regression modelling to identify predictors of mental health service
utilization. Applying findings from Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will qualitatively explore barriers and facilitators
identified in Aims 1 and 2 through in-depth interviews with Syrian refugee adults, who represent the highest
number of refugees displaced to Sweden.
Fellowship Information: The proposed research is in fulfillment of the doctoral dissertation of Ms. Diana
Rayes, a current PhD student in the Department of International Health at Johns Hopkins University. This
study directly aligns with NIMH’s priorities to reduce disparities and advance equity in mental health services
and outcomes. The training and research will be supported by one Sponsor, one Co-Sponsor, two Consultants,
and one Special Contributor who, combined, offer expertise in mixed methods and health disparities research
as it pertains to the health of trauma-affected, marginalized populations. Training includes coursework, field
research and other opportunities to prepare Ms. Rayes to become a leading researcher in public mental health."
10831411,"Abstract
The ability to noninvasively modulate and image the brain with spatial and temporal precision is highly desirable
for understanding brain circuits in health and disease. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a method for
stimulating the superficial cortex with high spatial and temporal precision, and its effects can be aimed at deeper
targets by leveraging the trans-synaptic connectivity of brain circuits. Functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) has high spatial resolution but limited temporal precision, and the opposite holds for
electroencephalography (EEG). These three noninvasive electromagnetic methods have recently been
combined to achieve high spatial and temporal precision of concurrent modulation and imaging of the brain. This
approach, however, has various significant technical limitations, including mutual electromagnetic artifacts
decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio and delaying the acquisition of imaging/EEG data, TMS acoustic noise co-
activating auditory pathways, and the inability to adaptively adjust the TMS coil position within the MRI scanner
for optimal targeting. The overarching objective of this project is to address these limitations by developing and
integrating an array of novel technologies. We will develop a compact, energy efficient, quiet, as well as MRI-
and EEG-compatible TMS coil. The TMS coil will be actuated with a custom MRI-compatible robotic system,
allowing adaptive optimization of the coil position and orientation based on imaging feedback. The neural circuit
responses to the stimulation will be imaged with a newly developed a flexible, head-conforming array of MRI
coils combining local magnetic field shimming and RF receiving to achieve high signal-to-noise ratio and fast
image acquisition. The brain activity will be simultaneously recorded both before and after TMS with high
temporal resolution and low noise using a novel wireless EEG system. To meet the technical challenges of
creating such as a system operating inside MRI scanners, our team has developed several breakthrough
technologies that will work synergistically to reduce or eliminate couplings between system components and
enhance the stimulation precision and imaging speed and sensitivity. Once developed, the robotically-actuated
TMS-EEG-fMRI system will enable systematic interrogation of human brain circuits inside an MRI scanner with
spatial and temporal flexibility and precision that are impossible to achieve with current technology. The
integrated system will be easy-to-use, and platform-agonistic thus having the potential for immediate and
scalable impact. First-time adaptive optimization of the TMS coil placement in the MRI scanner will be
demonstrated for brain-state-triggered engagement of a deep brain target. In summary, the proposed robotically-
actuated TMS-EEG-fMRI system will enable modulation and imaging of brain circuits with enhanced anatomical
and functional precision that can lead to advances in neuroscience research and therapeutic interventions."

The proposed Center on Probes for Molecular Mechanotechnology (CPMM) will work to develop and optimize
technologies to enable the study of mechanobiology and mechanotransduction pathways in living cells. The
CPMM includes three highly synergistic Technology Development Projects (TDPs) that will be led by Alexa
Mattheyses, Khalid Salaita, and Yonggang Ke who have a strong track record of jointly publishing and working
together to developed tension probe technologies. In TDP#1: High resolution probes for mechanobiology, we
will create “indestructible” probes that can push the limits of spatial and orientation resolution for the DNA tension
probe technology. Tension-PAINT imaging will be refined to achieve realtime 20 nm spatial mapping of forces
and to combine this with immunostaining to map the proteins that assemble within proximity to mechanically
active receptors. Force orientation will be mapped using fluorescence polarization methods with turn-key
commercial microscopes. In TDP#2: Probes for mechanical tagging, we will develop methods of force-induced
tagging. The central design feature is a DNA probe that mediates a binding event or dissociation event at
threshold levels of force. Cells are tagged based on the magnitude and frequency of mechanical events
generated by a cell surface receptors. This TDP will lead to high-throughput analysis of cells using flow cytometry
and will also allow for proteomic analysis to open the door to “mechanomics”. Under TDP#3: Amplified force
sensors, the central technology here is responsive DNA structures that amplify mechanical inputs. The CPMM
has nine associated inaugural Driving Biomedical Projects (DBPs) led by a team of geographically diverse
collaborators. DBPs #1-#4 are focused on mechanobiology of T cells and use CPMM tools to test the
mechanosensor function of the T cell receptor (TCR) and the adhesion receptor LFA-1. DBP#5 focuses on the
heterogeneity in cancer cells. DBP#6 and #7 target the mechanosensor responses of platelets. Finally, DBP#8
and #9 address fundamental questions of the role of mechanics in focal adhesions. Our prototype TDP
technologies provide methods to measure molecular forces with the same ease and simplicity as that of
immunostaining, flow cytometry, PCR and ELISA. But unlike these mainstream techniques, mechano-imaging,
mechano-PCR, mechano-flow, and mechano-ELISA are not commercialized. Hence, the reagents and surface
preparation protocols and data analysis routines have to be custom prepared by the end user. This can be
challenging to the non-expert and is not routine. Therefore, the CPMM will integrate a strong Community
Engagement (CE) component. CE activities will focus on hands-on training workshops, publication of methods
articles, virtual seminar series, industry engagement, a strong web presence and engagement with three key
mechanobiology conferences that will help accelerate adoption of the tension probe technology. These CE
activities will ultimately lead to commercialization which will enable wide spread dissemination across the various
cell biology communities."

This application is for a Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) for Dr. Lauren
Katz. She is currently conducting research on craniofacial skeletal muscle and has observed that this muscle
type has a unique regenerative program compared to muscles of the limb and trunk. This K08 will enhance Dr.
Katz's ability to 1) become an expert in craniofacial muscle stem cells and regeneration, 2) conduct basic
science research at the highest level in a tissue rarely studied, 3) acquire cutting-edge skills in stem cell
techniques including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and ex vivo cell transplantation, 4) gain skills in
proposal development, manuscript preparation, and data presentation, and 5) develop a high-quality
independent research program that will allow for collaborative opportunities with scientists and clinicians from
across disciplines. To achieve these goals, Dr. Katz has devised a clear and focused training plan and has
identified individuals who are experts in the aforementioned disciplines. Her multidisciplinary mentoring team
consists of: Drs. James White (basic scientist, skeletal muscle regeneration and stem cells), William Maixner
(clinician-scientist, oral and craniofacial research), Shannon Wallet (basic scientist, oral and craniofacial
research), Elisabeth Barton (basic scientist, skeletal muscle regeneration), Kevin Byrd (clinician-scientist, oral
stem cells), Lyndon Cooper (clinician-scientist, oral stem cells), Eric Everett (basic scientist, oral biology),
Jimena Giudice (basic scientist, skeletal muscle research), and Simon Gregory (basic scientist, scRNA-seq).
There exists a clinical need to rebuild functional craniofacial muscle in patients suffering from certain diseases
(muscular dystrophy, hemifacial microsomia), facial trauma, and tumor resections. The lack of a
comprehensive investigation of the craniofacial musculature and its stem population has resulted in a poor
understanding of the regenerative capacity of this tissue when faced with disease or trauma. Our current
knowledge of skeletal muscles and their stem cell populations comes from the limb muscles; however, it is
known that distinct differences in embryological origin exist between muscles of the limb and those of the
craniofacial region. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to use injury models to elucidate the in vivo
regenerative capacity of craniofacial skeletal muscle and to perform deep phenotyping on isolated craniofacial
satellite cells to identify molecular targets specific to craniofacial muscle regeneration. Regenerative capacity
will be assessed using in vivo models of muscle regeneration and in vitro cellular function assays (Aim 1).
scRNA-seq and ex vivo stem cell transplantation will be utilized to identify craniofacial muscle-specific
regulators of myogenesis (Aim 2) and identified targets will be investigated using lentiviral vectors and
knockout models (Aim 3). Together, the K08 training and mentorship will enable Dr. Katz to transition into an
independent research career and become a leader in the field of craniofacial muscle regenerative medicine
and translational therapeutics."
10811758,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our proposed project focuses on understanding interactive effects of gender and sex on biological processes
implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk. Gender is defined as an individual’s presentation as female or male,
and sex is defined by chromosomes and sex organs. Stress has both gender- and sex-linked components.
However, whether exposure to gender-linked stressors relates to neural and peripheral processes that promote
AD pathology, or whether sex hormones mediate these relationships, is unknown. In this proposal, we seek to
understand interactive effects of gender-linked stressor exposure and estrogen levels on memory, memory-
related neural activation, functional connectivity (FC) at rest, and peripheral inflammation. In doing so, the
proposal enables further study of AD mechanisms and development of interventions to reduce AD risk. The
objective of this proposal is to determine interactive effects of lifetime gender-linked stressor exposure and
estrogen levels on memory-related brain activation, resting state FC, peripheral inflammation, and verbal
memory in midlife women at risk for AD due to family history. The rationale for this project is that gender and
sex, indexed by stress exposures and estrogen, interactively promote changes in neural activation, FC, and
peripheral inflammation, which may facilitate AD pathology in women at risk for AD. Specific Aim 1 will investigate
interactive effects of gender-linked stressor exposure and estrogen levels on fMRI activation during memory
encoding, fMRI task performance, and default mode network (DMN) FC at rest. Specific Aim 2 will investigate
effects of gender-linked stressor exposure and estrogen interactivity on peripheral inflammation and verbal
memory. Specific Aim 3 will investigate the effects of peripheral inflammation on fMRI activation and FC at rest.
To achieve these aims, we will recruit participants from our Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement Prevention Center
at Cleveland Clinic, which serves women at risk for AD due to family history. Specific Aims 1-2 will include lifetime
gender-linked stressor exposure as a predictor, and as outcomes, a pattern separation fMRI task, a resting state
scan, plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and neuropsychological measures of verbal memory. Specific
Aim 3 will use plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as predictors of task-based activation and resting
state FC. All analyses will include estradiol levels as a mediator. This study is expected to provide evidence
relating greater lifetime gender-linked stressor exposures to poorer verbal memory in women at risk for AD, as
well as to processes likely to contribute to sex and gender disparities in AD, such as hippocampal hyperactivation
and reduced DMN deactivation during memory encoding, greater posterior to anterior DMN FC at rest, and
higher peripheral inflammation. The proposed research is innovative in its focus on variables impacted by sex
and gender that may catalyze AD pathology in women at risk for AD, and is significant in providing strong
scientific justification for further study of inflammation and neural activity and FC as AD mechanisms. Results of
our study will inform development of interventions targeting stress and inflammation to reduce AD risk."
10795974,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global disability, and approximately 30% of MDD
patients are resistant to conventional antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic
stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an FDA-cleared intervention with proven
efficacy in treatment-resistant depression, but only 30–40% of these patients achieve remission after a single
course. Other studies have shown that rTMS targeting the dorsomedial PFC (DMPFC) is comparably effective,
but biomarkers for informing target site selection and predicting differential treatment response are not
currently available. Diagnostic heterogeneity has been a major obstacle to biomarker discovery efforts.
Recently, we developed and validated an approach to diagnosing four novel MDD subtypes or “biotypes”
defined by distinct resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns in Valence System circuits and
predicting differing antidepressant responses at the individual level to rTMS targeting the DMPFC. This
confirmatory efficacy trial will test a novel, biotype-guided treatment selection strategy motivated by the
hypothesis that an individual patient's likelihood of responding to left DLFPC vs. DMPFC rTMS is determined in
part by individual differences in 1) the degree to which their symptoms are driven by dysfunction in specific
downstream amygdala, striatal, and salience network targets comprising aspects of Valence Systems; and 2)
the degree to which dysfunction in those targets can be modulated by stimulating the left DLPFC or DMPFC.
Subjects (N=405) will be randomized to receive a) biotype-guided 10 Hz rTMS targeting the DMPFC or left
DLPFC; b) to a disconfirmation arm receiving rTMS targeting the opposite site; and c) to a third arm receiving
FDA-cleared, standard-of-care 10 HZ rTMS targeting the left DLFPC, regardless of biotype. All patients will be
tested before and after treatment on a battery of fMRI, behavioral, and clinical assessments, grounded in
RDoC-informed measures of emotion regulation and effort valuation, which will enable us to validate
downstream brain circuit treatment targets and test for target engagement, in conjunction with state-of-the-art,
anatomically realistic electric field modeling and fiber tractography. The primary goal is to confirm the efficacy
of a novel RSFC biomarker-guided approach to differential treatment selection in treatment resistant
depression, with the potential for significantly enhanced efficacy compared to the current standard-of-care."

Pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells) have the ability to self-renew and to differentiate into multiple lineages
in vitro. This makes these cells a powerful tool to study early embryonic developmental pathways and to generate
specific cell populations for regenerative medicine and disease investigation. Our research group has pioneered
methods to derive large quantities of skeletal myogenic progenitor cells from mouse and human pluripotent ES
and iPS cells. Upon transplantation into dystrophic mice, these progenitors are not only able to generate new
functional myofibers, but also to seed the satellite cell compartment, thus providing long-term regeneration. With
prior NIH support, we defined the molecular signature of in vitro-generated PSC-derived myogenic progenitors
by comparing their transcriptome profiles to those of primary skeletal myogenic progenitors isolated at different
developmental stages. Our findings revealed that PSC-derived myogenic progenitors possess a molecular
signature similar to embryonic/fetal myoblasts. Paradoxically however, they differ functionally from fetal
myoblasts, as PSC-derived myogenic progenitors show much superior myofiber engraftment and ability to seed
the satellite cell niche, respond to multiple re-injuries and contribute to long-term regeneration. These results led
us to hypothesize that exposure to the adult host skeletal muscle environment may induce molecular changes
in transplanted cells. We found this to be the case as transcriptome analysis of PSC-derived mononuclear cells
(MNCs) re-isolated after engraftment revealed a shift in molecular signature from embryonic/fetal towards
neonatal/adult stages. In this renewal application we propose studies to understand i) the interaction and
molecular cues provided by the adult niche that favor the in vivo maturation of PSC-derived myogenic
progenitors, ii) the role of post-transcriptional regulation in this process, and iii) the dynamics of engraftment and
the quiescence status of specific donor-derived sub-fractions."

 The development of biomarkers for identifying preclinical or prodromal Alzheimer’s disorder are of great in-
terest. While some initial results based on resting fMRI have been presented, accuracy, robustness, and relia-
bility are still relatively low. One highly promising direction is the development of dynamic functional activity and
functional connectivity approaches. These approaches have been shown to be especially promising most likely
due to the highly dynamic nature of the brain and the unconstrained nature of resting fMRI. Currently, there are
no methods that can provide a full characterization of temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal dynamics nor can
most existing approaches characterize heterogenous subgroups or complex multiscale relationships. We will
develop new methods that can effectively capture dynamic connectivity and provide summary metrics with a
focus on individualized prediction of Alzheimer’s disease well prior to the onset of the illness. We propose a
novel family of models that builds on the well-structured framework of joint blind source separation to capture a
more complete characterization of (potentially nonlinear) spatio-temporal dynamics. Our models will also pro-
duce a rich set of metrics to characterize the available dynamics and enable in depth comparison with currently
available models. We show evidence that such measures are likely to be considerably more sensitive and more
accurate in classifying individuals. We will extensively validate our approaches in a variety of ways including
simulations, concurrent EEG/fMRI data, and evaluation on a large normative data set. We will apply the devel-
oped methods to several large datasets including a large longitudinal sample of individuals who have been
scanned at Emory University with resting fMRI who also have CSF amyloid and tau PET measures. We will use
the developed markers to predict cognitive decline, amyloid, and tau levels in these data and include both a
discovery data set as well as an independent replication data set. Successful completion of our aims will be an
important first step towards providing an opportunity to develop and evaluate interventions early enough to have
a positive impact on long-term prognosis. We will provide open source tools and release data throughout the
duration of the project via GitHub, a web portal and the NITRC repository, hence enabling other investigators to
compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. Our tools
also have wide application to the study of the healthy brain as well as many other diseases.

10831489,"Targeted alpha-emitter therapy (TAT) is an emerging modality in the cancer therapy. By directly killing cancer
cells it is less susceptible to development of resistance. Combination of external beam radiation therapy (XRT)
and TATs have a high potential for treatment of systemic disease: the XRT is effective for a small number of
large tumors, and the TAT for small, widely disseminated metastases. To understand the targeting behavior and
dose response, dosimetry information is required in preclinical and early-stage clinical studies. Estimates of the
dose distribution are essential for optimal planning of TAT alone and combined with XRT. Knowledge of the dose
distribution from TATs could shorten clinical trials by helping select patients for whom the therapy is most likely
to be effective, and by shortening Phase 1 dose escalation trials by using knowledge of toxicities obtained from
XRT experience. The distribution of the radionuclide in vivo is a prerequisite for estimating TAT dose distribution.
For alpha emitters, there are several significant challenges. Due to their high linear energy transfer and resulting
lethality, low doses are commonly used. Also, the spectrum typically has many low-abundance gamma rays
spread over a wide energy range combined with characteristic x-rays. Typical decay chains include multiple
daughter radionuclides, and it is important to estimate their activity distributions. These capabilities would be
enabled by an advanced SPECT system with high sensitivity and high spatial and energy resolution. In this
project, we will develop the Alpha-SPECT system, a novel scanner aimed at imaging of these radionuclides. It
uses advanced spectroscopic CZT imaging detectors to provide excellent spatial resolution, ultrahigh sensitivity,
and excellent energy resolution of these radionuclides in large animals. To achieve this, we will push the forefront
of CZT detector technology a generation ahead of the current state-of-art commercial CZT-based gamma-ray
detectors. We will combine this CZT-based detection system with the novel synthetic compound-eye gamma
camera design to realize the Alpha-SPECT system. We will develop quantitative reconstruction methods and
web-based interface for this system to estimate the distribution of the parent and daughter radionuclides. Finally,
we will evaluate the system and reconstruction method using phantom and large animal imaging studies using
TATs that are currently under development at Johns Hopkins to validate the system. We will market access to
the system as a core service to the cancer research community through Johns Hopkins and, through Rapid,
LLC, to commercial drug developers. This project will not only serve as a critical step to bring the unique spectral
SPECT imaging capability to end users who are currently developing targeted radionuclide therapies, but it also
will potentially lead to a state-of-art spectral-CZT detector platform for use by the research community and
industry in developing the next generation clinical SPECT instrumentations for applications beyond targeted
radionuclide therapies. This prosed project has a clear pathway to serve a much broader spectrum of end-users."

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease often show airway epithelial remodeling including basal cell
hyperplasia, and goblet cell and squamous cell metaplasia. Such pathologic changes profoundly affect the
outcome of respiratory infection as airway epithelium plays a crucial role in defining the innate and adaptive
immunity in the lungs. Airway basal cells are the specialized stem cells and regenerate functional mucociliary-
differentiated airway epithelium upon injury. The fact that COPD patients show airway epithelial remodeling
indicate dysregulated repair mechanisms in airway basal cells. Our research suggests that quercetin, a natural
polyphenol reverses airway epithelial remodeling in a mouse model of COPD. Our preliminary studies indicate
that quercetin reprograms dysregulated repair pathways in COPD basal cells leading to regeneration of normal
airway epithelium. We conducted transcriptomic analysis of airway basal cells from healthy non-smokers and
COPD subjects and COPD basal cells treated with quercetin. Results from this microarray indicated
dysregulation of genes involved in tissue development and epithelial differentiation in COPD cells. Intriguingly,
the topmost differentially regulated genes in both these pathways are genes involved in lung morphogenesis
HOXA1 and HOXB2. In normal basal cells, HOXA1 is highly expressed in basal cells, while HOXB2 expression
increased at two weeks of culturing and correlated with polarization of cells, a prerequisite step in differentiation.
COPD basal cells showed significantly reduced expression of both HOXA1 and HOXB2 and quercetin treatment
increased expression of both genes. Based on these observations, we will examine a novel hypotheses that
quercetin via modulation of HOXA1 and HOXB2 corrects the dysregulated repair mechanisms, thus improving
immune responses to respiratory infections and lung function in COPD. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the
role of HOXA1 and HOXB2 in the regeneration of airway epithelium, and whether quercetin corrects the
dysregulated repair mechanism in COPD by modulation of these HOX genes. In Specific Aim 2, we will examine
the molecular mechanisms by which quercetin-induced HOXA1 and HOXB2 participates in the regeneration of
airway epithelium. In Specific Aim 3, we will examine whether quercetin-induced HOXA1 and HOXB2 participate
in limiting exaggerated innate immune responses to rhinovirus infection and prevent progression of lung disease
in COPD. Finally, we will confirm whether quercetin treatment reduces airway epithelial remodeling in COPD
patients and correlate with the expression of HOXA1 and HOXB2. Completion of these studies will provide
important insight into airway epithelial regeneration and the mechanisms by which quercetin reduces airway
epithelial remodeling in COPD."

Fluorescent proteins (FPs) and their derived biosensors based on fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET) have revolutionized biology/medicine by allowing the visualization of dynamic molecular
activities in live cells with high spatiotemporal resolutions. Optogenetics has enabled the perturbation of
specific molecular events in living systems, however, there is a lack of methods to manipulate cells and
tissues deep in the body. I propose here to develop acoustothermogenetics as a general method to allow
the direct, remotely-controlled, non-invasive manipulation of live cell functions in deep body sites for the
correction of pathological processes and the control of specific therapeutic interventions. I will first
engineer molecular sensors and genetic transducers which will allow the engineered cell to perceive the
ultrasound signals directly and transduce them into genetic activation for the production of desired protein
regulators. I will then use cell-based immunotherapy, particularly chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-
expressing T cells, as my initial test target to establish, in principle, the practical utility of this new method.
CAR-T immunotherapy is becoming a paradigm-shifting therapeutic approach for cancer treatment, but
its broad application has major challenges. I propose to develop ultrasound-sensitive CAR-T cells for
their control from a distance by ultrasound transducers to target and eradicate solid tumors. Lastly, I will
extend this remotely-controlled acoustothermogenetics approach to develop a general system that would
allow the control of, in principle, any genetic or epigenetic modulation in live cells for the reprogramming
of cellular functions under in vivo situation. This approach should allow the remotely-controlled cell
activation with a high spatiotemporal precision in a non-invasive manner for a broad range of therapeutic
applications. This novel approach should also provide a general paradigm to dynamically control
molecular and cellular functions for biological studies and clinical applications."

 Our research program focuses on the mechanism of eukaryotic protein synthesis and translational
control. The two projects we are currently studying are: (1) the mechanism of translational control by the fragile
X mental retardation protein (FMRP), and (2) the mechanism of translation initiation on influenza A virus (IAV)
mRNAs. Fragile X syndrome is a disease that afflicts about 100,000 Americans and about 3 million people
worldwide, resulting in intellectual disability, childhood seizures, and autistic behavior in the patients. The
disease is caused by the transcriptional silencing of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1). FMR1 gene
codes for an RNA-binding protein, FMRP, which is highly expressed in the brain and is essential for the normal
development of the brain. Mammals have two autosomal paralogs of FMRP designated as fragile X related 1
and 2 (FXR1 and FXR2) proteins. FMRP, FXR1 and FXR2 have been implicated in regulating the translation of
several mRNAs. However, the precise mechanism by which these proteins regulate the expression of these
mRNAs is unknown. The goal of the first project is to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the
regulation of protein synthesis by FMRP, FXR1 and FXR2. We will use a robust in vitro translation system,
biochemical techniques and quantitative biophysical methods to significantly advance our understanding of the
molecular mechanism used by FMRP, FXR1 and FXR2 to regulate protein synthesis. Results of these studies
will provide useful insights in identifying potential drug targets to treat fragile X syndrome.
 The goal of the second project is to investigate the mechanism of translation initiation by IAV mRNAs.
IAV is responsible for several thousand deaths annually and is a severe threat to global public health. We have
new data that indicate that IAV mRNAs may use a non-canonical mechanism of translation initiation. Our studies
show that poly A binding protein 1 (PABP1) binds to the highly conserved sequences present in the 5’-UTR of
IAV mRNAs. Additionally, we show that the translation of the IAV mRNA is more resistant to the inactivation of
eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) compared to a control mRNA. We hypothesize that the recruitment of
PABP1 to the viral 5’-UTRs tethers eIF4G and promote the assembly of the translation initiation complex in an
eIF4E-independent manner. This may favor the translation of IAV mRNAs under cellular stress conditions in the
cell, which is known to reduce the activity of eIF4E. We will determine whether the binding of PABP1 to the 5’-

10861795,"Sepsis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Typically, 50% of all sepsis cases start
as an infection in the lungs leading to uncontrolled inflammation and breach of vascular barrier.
These processes directly involve vascular endothelial cells. Despite the recent progress towards
understanding of the basis of pathogen-induced vascular permeability and inflammation,
incomplete understanding of intrinsic mechanisms driving recovery of microvascular integrity
and organ function, represents a critical barrier to progress beyond the problem of ALI and
sepsis. Therefore, further studies identifying specific mechanisms potential interventions
accelerating vascular endothelial cell (EC) barrier restoration after inflammatory insults are
much needed. This translational research study will test a new hypothetical mechanism of Ras-
proximate-1 (Rap1) GTPase-assisted vascular recovery in the models of bacterial lung injury.
We hypothesize that Rap1-induces re-assembly of lung microvascular EC cell junctions and
recruitment of cell junction-associated coiled-coil protein (JACOP). This process stimulates
JACOP interaction with RhoA GTPase-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1,
leading to inhibition of GEF-H1 activity, and attenuation of RhoA pathway of EC barrier
disruption and inflammation. Based on this mechanism, we will determine JACOP domains with
GEF-H1 inhibitory and cell junction targeting activities and test their efficacy in suppressing the
local endothelial hyper-permeability and inflammation caused by Staphylococcus aureus
bacterial particles. The proposed study may have a broader impact on the other aspects of
vascular responses to inflammatory or pro-angiogenic stimuli mediated by cell adhesive
structures (i.e. adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes, formation of atherosclerotic plaque,
EC barrier compromise and inflammatory injury during cardiac ischemia/reperfusion, etc.).
Characterization of a new Rap1-dependent mechanism of local Rho control by GEF-H1 -
JACOP axis will enhance understanding of feedback mechanisms driving lung self-recovery and
advance development of future therapeutic treatments."
10917030,"Abstract: This project explores the intersection of two fundamental areas: cellular (mal)adaptation to
primary mitochondrial dysfunction and the biology of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCUC). In humans,
primary mitochondrial disease arises from mutations in nuclear- or mitochondrial-encoded DNA, or from
pharmacological agents or toxins. Skeletal muscle is among the most severely affected organs. Mouse
models of mitochondrial myopathy (MM) show that energy deficit, per se, is not the major factor for
pathology, but, rather, that mitochondrial dysfunction initiate a progression of adaptive and maladaptive
changes in, e.g., metabolism and proteostasis, and also activates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the
Integrated Stress Response (ISR); the result is muscle atrophy, weakness, and diminished exercise capacity.
Major cytoplasmic signaling pathways beyond the ISR have been investigated but found to not fully explain MM.
Whether processes within mitochondria can impact MM progression has only been narrowly considered.
Published data and our preliminary data document an increased abundance of the MCUC and
increased mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in MM and myopathies of other origins. The possibility that
mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake contributes to pathology has only been considered in the context of MCUC's ability
to cause a sustained opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which can trigger cell
death. Yet, our preliminary data suggest the hypothesis that the MCUC serves a beneficial role in MM, by
expanding the oxidative phosphorylation capacity of dysfunctional muscle mitochondrial, and blunting the
ISR. This hypothesis will be tested in two Specific Aims, by depletion MCUC in two models of MM (mice
with depletion of PiC in skeletal muscle; mice with whole-body loss of Frataxin), for in vivo and ex vivo
studies. We will also use advanced imaging techniques and genetic sensors to evaluate metabolism,
bioenergetics and redox, and calcium, in a compartmentalized manner, including at the ER-mitochondria
interface, in cells acutely depleted of MCUC. We will also use sophisticated methods to evaluate protein
translation, since this is a key feature of the ISR that can influence muscle mass. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis
that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake improves energetics during the early phase of mitochondrial dysfunction.
Aim 2 will determine how MCUC contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction-induced ER stress and the ISR
and consequences on cell viability and muscle mass. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that regulation of MCUC
by MICU3 renders mitochondria vulnerable to sustained mPTP opening such that the MCUC becomes a
liability for skeletal muscle at later phases of mitochondrial dysfunction. These studies are expected to reveal
a novel role for MCUC in the (mal)adaptive response of skeletal muscle to mitochondrial dysfunction and
in regulating muscle mass in myopathy, and, broadly, to provide new insight into the regulation of major
stress signaling pathways that are activated in different myopathies, and many other stress conditions.

10913970,"Improving Inflammation Resolution to Mitigate Acquired Bone Marrow Failure
Bone marrow failure is the devastating collapse of blood production, and current treatments are
inadequate. First line therapies include immunosuppressive therapies, and when feasible, bone marrow
transplantation. These therapies are often efficacious in the short-term, especially for young patients,
however they are much less effective in older patients. Immune suppression is not well tolerated,
especially in the elderly, and carries increased susceptibility to infection. Therefore, alternative
therapies are needed. It is well established that bone marrow failure is associated with non-resolving
inflammation. The resolution of inflammation requires the balance between pro-inflammatory
leukotrienes or prostaglandins and w3-derived specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), like
resolvins. Using a mouse model of acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA) that mirrors key features of
human disease, we established a role for impaired inflammation resolution programs in disease
pathogenesis. Our preliminary work demonstrates the effectiveness of SPMs in ameliorating SAA. The
rationale for the proposed work is that rather than blunting inflammatory responses, promoting
resolution and reparative processes may be an ideal therapeutic strategy for bone marrow failure. The
proposed studies will address a fundamental gap in our understanding of the physiologically relevant
process of inflammation resolution in the bone marrow. We propose three integrated, but independent,
Aims to: (1) address mechanisms of impaired resolution, (2) determine the impact of SPMs in the
marrow in SAA, and (3) evaluate the effect of SPMs on function of hematopoietic stem cells.
The proposed work will support a novel approach to treat BMF without the use of immune suppression,
representing an important departure from the current standard of care. We believe these studies will be
impactful therapeutic options for BMF patients, particularly older patients where IST has failed, and
wherein host defenses are already weakened. At the same time, the proposed studies may provide
new mechanistic insight relevant to other diseases characterized by prolonged and non-resolved
inflammation, and thus will have broad impact to human health."
10755693,"Intrathecal oxytocin (OT) is in clinical trials as an opioid alternative for chronic pain treatment. Our work in mice
suggests that coupling intrathecal oxytocin with manual therapies (i.e. massage) optimizes the analgesic
properties of oxytocin. This project provides the framework to support this combination therapy by concentrating
on the spinal cord circuit mechanisms by which oxytocin alleviates pain. Our preliminary studies suggest that
oxytocin-specific spinal cord circuits are embedded within a previously uncharacterized dorsal horn
nociceptive/affective touch circuit. We will carry out three complementary sets of experiments to test the overall
hypothesis that oxytocin alleviates pain by balancing excitation, inhibition, nociception, and affective touch to
sculpt the activity of spinal projections systems that carry both negative valences (associated with noxious
stimuli), and signals associated with positive valence (like the pleasurable properties of touch). Pharmacological
and behavioral studies in rodents suggest that spinal cord oxytocin receptors (OTRs) mediate intrathecal
oxytocin-induced analgesia. In Aim 1 we map the distribution of OTR+ interneurons within the dorsal horn of
female and male mice, rats, and humans. In Aim 2, we map the specific input/output profiles of OTR+INs. Here
we test the hypothesis that inhibitory and excitatory OTR+INs integrate peripheral nociceptive/affective touch
information with OT to differentially regulate the activity of molecularly defined Lamina I projection neurons. In
Aim 3 we assay the contribution of OT spinal cord circuits to both sensory-evoked reflexes and affective-
motivational pain. For Aim 3 we implement our recently developed computational approaches to scale sensory-
reflexive and affective-motivational pain. Results from our human tissue studies will inform how our
interpretations of our rodent studies may be applied to human therapies. Based on our unique expertise in touch-
specific spinal cord circuits, access to a large repertoire of spinal cord-specific tools, and behavior analytics that
match the granularity of our circuit dissection techniques, we are uniquely poised to provide the theoretical
framework for this combination therapy. In addition to informing context and condition for OT delivery, this work
may also be used in the clinic to adjust OT dosage and delivery method. This project is impactful for several
other reasons: 1) using computer vision/machine learning we will uncover the specific aspects of the pain
experience that are alleviated by spinal cord OT, and assess efficacy against other analgesics; 2) our
computational approaches to objectively scale rodent pain can be easily shared and implemented across
research groups, serving as a blueprint to standardize rodent pain assessment (see Resource Sharing); 3) our
general approach and model can serve as a basic blueprint for testing how other neuromodulators are
functionally integrated into spinal cord circuits of touch and nociception; and; 4) this type of foundational work
informs innovative approaches to disentangle the sensory from the emotional experiences of pain, inspiring new
therapies to treat each uniquely."
10767988,"ABSTRACT
Saccular intracranial aneurysms (IA) represent a significant health issue in the US and worldwide. IA rupture
leads to intracranial hemorrhage, with devastating outcomes: 30% of patients die within a month of the initial
event, and 50% of survivors are left with severe neurological deficits requiring long-term care. IA is a multi-
factorial disorder underlain by genetic and environmental risk factors. In a series of genome-wide association
studies we identified multiple common variants that contribute to IA risk.
 To discover rare coding variants with large-effect size, we conducted whole exome sequencing analysis of
a cohort of >250 patients from 58 families, each with at least 3 members diagnosed with IA. This analysis
identified heterozygous rare and deleterious mutations in two novel genes, WBP11 and PPIL4, which collectively
explain more than 10% of familial IA cases in our cohort. In preliminary experiments, we demonstrated that loss-
of-function ppil4 and wbp11 zebrafish and mouse models display dramatic and similar changes in
cerebrovascular morphology and cerebral hemorrhage, suggesting convergent action, and uncovered a specific
requirement for both genes in endothelial cells (ECs). We also determined that depletion of WBP11 or PPIL4 in
human ECs induces a pathological transcriptional reprogramming towards a senescent cellular state.
Collectively, these findings led to the hypotheses that a) PPIL4 and WBP11 are critical components of a network
that regulates cerebrovascular morphology and EC homeostasis; b) pathological EC reprogramming is the
underlying mechanism in IA associated PPIL4 and WBP11 variants; and c) PPIL4 and WBP11 convergent action
to the Wnt signaling pathway is mediated through binding partners and disrupted by IA-associated mutations.
 In this proposal we apply experimental and functional genomics approaches to test these hypotheses, aiming
to establish the converging role of WBP11 and PPIL4 in cerebrovascular ECs, following the discovery of rare-
deleterious coding mutations associated with familial IA. The expected outcome of this work is to define and
integrate multiple facets that underpin the function of WBP11 and PPIL4: 1) the morphologic and histologic
consequences of global and EC-specific deficiency of WBP11 and PPIL4 for structural integrity of the cerebral
vessels in model organisms; 2) the impact of WBP11 and PPIL4 depletion and IA-associated variants on EC
function at the cellular and molecular level; and 3) the convergence of WBP11 and PPIL4 in ECs via activation
of Wnt signaling. These outcomes will inform a framework implicating pathological EC reprogramming as an
overlooked contributing factor in IA etiology, while providing a novel conceptual framework for IA
pathophysiology, with the long-term goal to develop precision medicine strategies to improve diagnosis and
molecularly informed therapeutic interventions for IA patients."

10814202,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The goal of cancer immunotherapy is to awaken the body’s anti-tumoral immune response to fight against
all cancers in all patients. Our lab recently identified a key mechanism by which cancer cells are detected by our
innate immune system. We now know that cancer cells, with intrinsic chromosomal instability, constantly secret
the soluble small molecule 2’3’-cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP). Acting as an immunotransmitter, extracellular
cGAMP is taken up by surrounding tissues and immune cells to activate its receptor STING in a paracrine fashion,
resulting in downstream anti-cancer immune responses. The importance of extracellular cGAMP is demonstrated
by our finding that it is required for the curative effect of ionizing radiation in a murine model of breast cancer.
Furthermore, we identified the extracellular enzyme ENPP1 as the only detectable hydrolase of extracellular
cGAMP that blocks its signaling pathway. Therefore, we hypothesize that ENPP1 is an innate immune
checkpoint that could be targeted to expand the reach of cancer immunotherapy.
 Although ENPP1 is cGAMP’s only hydrolase, it hydrolyzes extracellular ATP at comparable potency.
Therefore, genetic and pharmacological tools that are based on complete ablation of ENPP1 activity cannot be
used to distinguish the physiological role between extracellular cGAMP and ATP. Here, we propose selective
genetic and chemical biology approaches: we will characterize genetic tools that selectively abolish ENPP1’s
hydrolase activity toward extracellular cGAMP but not ATP (dENPP1cGAMP); in parallel we will develop substrate-
specific ENPP1 inhibitors as tool compounds and potential immunotherapeutics.
 In Aim 1, we will fully characterize the kinetics, selectivity, and mechanisms of action of mutant
dENPP1cGAMP, as well as the pathophysiology of dEnpp1cGAMP mice. In Aim 2, we will evaluate multiple tumor
models in the dEnpp1cGAMP mouse strain to determine the physiological roles of extracellular cGAMP in
controlling tumor growth and synergism with checkpoint blockers. In Aim 3, we will first characterize mechanism
of substrate selectivity of our lead cGAMP-selective ENPP1 inhibitor and then use this inhibitor to harness the
anti-tumoral effects of extracellular cGAMP. This proposal combines careful biochemical analyses with mouse
genetics and tool compound development to address the role of extracellular cGAMP in cancer, with the goal of
improving cancer immunotherapy."
10814268,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite the therapeutic promise of STING agonists in cancer, first in human studies have been hampered by
lack of precision therapy and issues with drug delivery. My laboratory studies triple negative breast cancer
(TNBC), a highly aggressive breast malignancy with limited therapeutic options and a poor prognosis. Recently,
we uncovered the mechanistic basis for hyperactive innate immune signaling in a major subset of TNBCs.
Specifically, we found that PTEN loss conspires with the kinases TBK1/IKKepsilon to inactivate Rab7, which limits
lysosomal degradation of STING. This renders PTEN null TNBCs particularly sensitive to STING agonists. Our
long-term goal is to utilize this knowledge to develop effective STING agonist-based immunotherapy for TNBC.
The overall objectives are to build upon our initial findings and enhance STING agonist efficacy more generally
in TNBCs by preventing STING degradation and improving STING agonist delivery. Our central hypothesis is
that prolonged STING agonism in tumor cells will more effectively abrogate TNBC growth and boost anti-tumor
immunity. The rationale for this project is that the ability to retain STING agonism in the tumor microenvironment
will be instrumental to enhancing its therapeutic efficacy in the clinical setting. The central hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Increase STING cellular retention by inhibiting Rab7; 2) Target adaptive
TREX1 upregulation to boost cGAS-STING activation upstream; and 3) Examine and compare in vivo
pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor efficacy of STING agonist when delivered via intra-tumoral injection versus
impregnation in a PEGylated breast biopsy marker. Given our findings that PTEN null TNBCs prevent
degradation of STING by maintaining Rab7 in an inactive state, we will study in the first aim whether the Rab7
inhibitor CID1067700 and Rab7 knockout can broaden STING agonism to PTEN WT TNBCs. Under the second
aim, we will test whether increasing levels of cytosolic dsDNA through TREX1 inhibition will further hyperactivate
cGAS-STING function. In the third aim, using the 4T1 TNBC mouse model, we plan to embed STING agonists
into pre-existing breast biopsy markers containing polyethylene glycol polymers as an immediate clinically
actionable way to maintain STING agonism in the tumor microenvironment versus intratumoral injection. The
research proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it represents a substantive
departure from the status quo by tackling this essential problem of STING degradation and duration of agonist
exposure via a multifaceted approach. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to have an
important positive impact by providing a strong evidence-based method to retain STING agonism in the clinical
trial setting, such that resultant therapeutic findings are interpretable and negative outcomes are not attributed
to drug leakage or to cell intrinsic degradation of STING. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential of
uncovering a new therapeutic strategy for patients with TNBC where there is an unmet need."

Neuroblastoma (NB) remains one of the deadliest childhood cancers. NB exhibits a paucity of recurrent protein
coding mutations and few targetable mutations (2-5), providing the rationale for this proposal. Noncoding variants
can disrupt regulatory and/or structural DNA leading to dysregulated transcriptional programs that promote
tumorigenesis. Our objective here is to identify noncoding variants and mechanisms that drive NB. Our central
hypothesis is that germline variants and somatic mutations within noncoding regulatory regions of DNA potently
influence NB initiation, progression and/or disease relapse. We will test our hypothesis in three specific aims: 1)
Define and evaluate differences in the epigenomic landscape of NB and NB precursor cells. First, a panel
of genetically diverse human-derived NB cell lines and neural crest cells (NCC; NB precursor cells) will be
characterized. 3D chromatin architecture at all promoters will be ascertained using an ultra-high-resolution
promoter-focused Capture C approach. Cells will be further profiled by whole genome sequencing (WGS), RNA-
seq, ATAC-Seq, and ChIP-seq for histone marks and key structural proteins. Evolution of the epigenomic
landscape from NB precursor to NB cells will be assessed. Data will be integrated with transcription factor binding
site functional predictions to provide a comprehensive resource for the interpretation of noncoding variants. 2)
Identify germline noncoding variants influencing NB tumorigenesis. We will perform variant-to-gene
mapping at NB susceptibility loci identified by GWAS and identify putative causal variants mapping to open
chromatin and involved in chromatin interactions in NB precursor or NB cells. Next, rare germline noncoding
mutations from WGS will be assessed in a similar manner to identify variants interacting with known cancer
predisposition genes. Further in silico prioritization will be accomplished via clinical correlative and integrative
host-tumor analyses. The mechanism by which top prioritized noncoding variants promote NB will be determined
using genetic manipulation in cell models in combination with Capture C, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and/or functional
studies. 3) Discover and assess biological relevance of somatic noncoding drivers of NB. We will integrate
WGS of diagnostic and relapsed NB tumors to identify noncoding mutations affecting regulatory DNA and
chromatin interactions in NB genomes. Recurrent variants will be further characterized through integration with
matched RNA-seq (n=443), DNA methylation (n=223) and clinical correlative studies. We will elucidate biological
relevance of prioritized mutations via massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) coupled with CRISPR-based
genetic manipulation in cell models in combination with Capture C, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and/or functional assays.
This work will have a sustained and positive impact on the field by providing substantial insights into the role of
the noncoding genome in this important childhood cancer, and has the potential to inform development of clinical
biomarkers and/or evidence-based therapies to improve outcomes of children with NB."
11013265,"Project Summary
Physical activity has been associated with several chronic disease markers for the past 25 years, and
countless studies have tested interventions to improve physical activity of sedentary populations. Most of these
intervention studies have attempted to improve physical activity behaviors by changing individual level drivers
of activity, like motivation, attitudes, and self-efficacy for being active. Unfortunately, these efforts to change
activity levels are often not sustained beyond the initial intervention period. One possible cause of this lack of
sustainability is that insufficient attention was paid to environmental factors that facilitate physical activity.
Thus, attention is shifting to more complex environmental and social contributions to physical activity, with the
aim of identifying multi-level strategies to better target interventions to groups that need help. Very few tests of
changing environment levels to increase physical activity exist in the literature. A focus on interventions at
environmental levels, as called for by recent reviews as well as reports from the Institute of Medicine, might
provide the long-term sustainable change that is needed to change physical activity in low-income populations.
This project seeks to test a new multi-level, multi-component package to increase moderate intensity physical
activity levels of people living in public housing developments. Our aims are to evaluate the effects of an
intervention package focused on the environment level to produce changes in moderate physical activity
among public housing residents. Furthermore, we will evaluate the added effects of an efficacy-tested
individual-level eHealth phone program to produce further changes in moderate intensity physical activity. The
design of this study is a prospective, cluster randomized controlled trial, with housing developments as the
units of randomization. In this four group, factorial, cluster randomized controlled trial, we will compare an
environmental intervention alone (E only), an individual intervention alone (I only), an environmental plus
individual intervention (E+I), all against a control group. Mediation and moderation of our intervention will be
assessed. Lastly, we will assess factors from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
domains to examine future implementation of a multi-level physical activity intervention among key informants in
public housing developments."
10813007,"Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are well-characterized as key fibrogenic cell type of the liver, contributing to the
development of liver fibrosis in a wide range of diseases. While it widely believed that the development of
pathological liver fibrosis is the result of “maladaptive” or overshooting HSC activation, the field also believes
that “physiological” HSC activation serve provides benefits in acute and/or chronic liver disease. However, there
is currently no understanding of what precisely the benefits of HSC activation constitute and whether there may
be “costs” at which these benefits come in addition to the negative long-term effects of prolonged fibrosis.
Purported functions of HSC activation include the mechanical stabilization of injured tissue and promotion of
hepatocyte survival by HSC-secreted collagen. However, these protective functions have not been
experimentally validated in vivo, and to date, it is not known which hepatic functions, injury responses and cell
types are affected by HSC. Moreover, there is little understanding on the role of HSC in homeostasis beyond the
fact that they store a large amount of the body’s retinyl esters. These fundamental gap are mostly due to the
field’s focus on pathogenic HSC activation and fibrosis as key determinant of outcomes; and the lack of tools to
study protective functions of HSC and HSC-derived mediators in vivo. Related to the field’s focus on pathogenic
fibrosis, HSC are commonly viewed as final and most downstream executors, which respond to signals from
injured hepatocytes and/or activated macrophages and thus represent the last step of an injury cascade.
However, this view ignores the fact that their anatomical position and prototypical protrusions endeavors HSC
with close connection to almost all hepatic cell types, pointing towards HSC as a potential hub in the liver’s
cellular network. We have generated several tools including HSC depletion, HSC-selective gene deletion, and
single cell RNA-sequencing based bioinformatics allowing us to determine the role of HSC in vivo and the efferent
signals through which HSC may orchestrate cell-cell communication in the homeostatic and injured state. These
tools have enabled us to generate a preliminary data supporting a key role for HSC in modulating hepatocyte
proliferation and injury, and will enable us to uncover protective and fibrosis-independent functions of HSC in
vivo. In Aim 1, we seek to test the contribution of HSC-hepatocyte crosstalk to liver regeneration (Aim 1),
focusing on responsible mechanisms and mediators and the hypothesis that HSC and hepatocytes form a
functional unit. In Aim 2, we will study the role of HSC as regulators of hepatocyte death, focusing on underlying
mediators and mechanisms and our hypothesis that HSC can both promote and protect from injury. Besides
providing better understanding novel HSC functions in the complex cellular crosstalk of the liver, our studies may
(i) reveal therapeutically targetable pathways in acute and chronic liver disease, and (ii) provide relevant
information on how targeting HSC activation or promoting HSC death, a main strategy for most direct antifibrotics
currently under development or in clinical trials in NASH, may affect the liver beyond simple reduction of fibrosis."

research in SSA by training researchers to develop strategic and operational capacity that will generate new
knowledge about the determinants of cancer risk and outcomes and improve effectiveness of strategies for
reducing risk and improve outcomes. The overarching goals of this training program are to 1) Develop and
disseminate best practices to enable the highest quality cancer research in Africa; 2) Teach fundamental skills
to those who conduct research in Africa; and 3) Create a cadre of individuals who can lead and support cancer
research in SSA. Our training program proposes the following specific aims: 1) Develop and implement an
educational and career development program that will maximize the rigor of research being conducted in SSA;
2) Recruit and train individuals who can build sustainable careers in cancer research; 3) Assess the impact of
this training program on the career outcomes of trainees and participants. Trainees will fall into two groups.
First, we propose a Principal Investigator (PI) Track for doctoral level investigators who will be trained to
demonstrate leadership in independent and collaborative research. Participants in the PI Track will become
proficient in research oversight and governance and build the skills and a scientific project focus toward
independent extramural grant funding. Second, a Project Management (PM) Track will be implemented to
support the conduct of research. Participants in the PM Track will be qualified to support a variety of research
projects within SSA health and regulatory settings. Training will involve bilateral interactions between mentors
and trainees in both SSA and the US who will partner to develop and implement best research practices. The
training program will build on highly successful existing research networks in SSA: The African Breast Cancer
Study (ABCS), The African Esophageal Cancer Consortum (AFRECC), The African Research Group in
Oncology (ARGO), and the Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate (MADCaP) network.
Building on mentors and research capacity of these networks, the proposed program will provide a core
research curriculum known as the PROject Management Oversight Training and Education in AFRICA
(PROMOTE-AFRICA) framework as well as project-based (for the PI Track) or practicum-based (for the PM
track) activities as well as other educational experiences to individuals seeking careers as independent cancer

10809623,"The most widely-accepted description of the β-cells glucose sensing mechanism involves the mitochondrial oxidation of glucose carbons to raise the ATP/ADP ratio, close KATP channels, and activate Ca2+ influx, which triggers insulin exocytosis. While there is no dispute that oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) contributes to function and increased ATP biosynthetic capacity in β-cells, several lines of genetic, biophysical and experimental evidence challenge one key component of the canonical mechanism – the exclusivity of coupling OxPhos to KATP channel closure. Importantly, the expansion mitochondrial metabolites (anaplerosis) through pyruvate carboxylase (PC) is more strongly correlated with insulin secretion than oxidative flux through pyruvate
dehydrogenase (PDH). Glucose carbons that transit PC generate 40% of the cytosolic  phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) through the cataplerotic mitochondrial PEP carboxykinase (PCK2) reaction. This ‘PEP cycle’ provides a mechanism distinct from OxPhos for cytosolic ATP/ADP generation via pyruvate kinase (PK). Here, we propose a unified model that reconciles canonical OxPhos with anaplerosis by invoking an oscillatory, two-state model where PK itself initiates KATP channel closure. In the first phase, termed ‘MitoSynth,’ cytosolic ADP lowering by PK deprives mitochondria of ADP (termed ‘ADP privation’) that 1) turns off OxPhos to accelerate the PEP cycle, 2) PEP then leaves the mitochondria where 3) its hydrolysis by PK locally triggers KATP channel closure. Following depolarization, the second phase, termed ‘MitoOx,’ sustains membrane depolarization and insulin secretion via OxPhos. This revised model has profound implications for β-cell function, pharmacotherapy and health. This proposal will determine if PK can outcompete mitochondria for ADP, if such ADP privation turns off OxPhos and induces mitochondrial PEP synthesis, and if targeting MitoSynth can improve islet function and health in vivo. AIM 1: To assess how PK-mediated ADP privation induces the high-voltage, low-current MitoSynth state. This aim asks the question, can PK steal ADP from mitochondria as part of the signal to stimulate insulin
secretion? Such ADP privation induces KATP triggering and mitochondrial hyperpolarization at the end of the electrically-silent phase. AIM 2: To determine the regulation of anaplerotic and cataplerotic metabolism by mitochondrial ADP privation during MitoSynth. The hypothesis is that mitochondrial ADP privation activates PEP cycling through the generation of allosteric intermediates. This aim assesses the mechanistic, functional and biochemical characterization of the MitoSynth state. Aim 3: To determine the physiological and pharmacological significance MitoSynth and MitoOx phases of β-cell glucose sensing in vivo. In the two-state model, there are at least two targetable mechanisms to augment insulin secretion: lengthening MitoOx, or shortening the time for MitoSynth to trigger depolarization. We will determine if MitoOx lengthening injures islets while MitoSynth shortening promotes human islet health."

The three research projects of this program project grant utilize single cell genomic strategies and
complementary imaging strategies to define cell-cell interactions in target tissues in systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These projects will be used to develop insight into the
development, function, localization, and interactions of B and T lymphocytes (Project 1), monocytes (Project 2),
and fibroblasts (Project 3). Key to understanding these cell-types is the effective interpretation of complex high-
dimensional data sets. The Computational Systems Immunology (CSI) core will support the analytical and
computational needs for the three projects. This core will build from our experience with the Accelerating
Medical Partnerships (AMP) RA/SLE program where analysis of high dimensional single cell data sets has now
given us the first look at the constituent immune and stromal cellular populations. CSI will 1) employ
computational strategies to analyze and integrate multiple single cell RNA-seq datasets to define key cellular
populations 2) use trajectory analysis to define transitional states between cells. 3) Define clonal populations
with repertoire sequencing and 4) Define the relationship between cell-cell interactions and transcriptional

tissue of RA patients. In Project 2, we will focus on 3 monocyte states that we observe in lupus nephritis kidneys,
which likely arise from patrolling blood monocytes that enter the kidney. While these monocytes share expressed
genes with the previously described M1/M2 spectrum of monocyte states, they express distinct functional
modules and do not map directly to those states. To better understand these disease-associated monocyte
states, we will perform experiments to address three hypotheses. First, we hypothesize that monocyte
inflammation, phagocytosis, and tissue repair programs in lupus nephritis kidneys are regulated by fibroblasts
and tissue-derived factors. With Project 3, we will co-culture primary monocytes with activated/inflammatory
fibroblasts together with known local pathogenic factors and determine changes in cellular functions, including
phagocytosis, cytokine secretion, endothelial extravasation, T/B cell activation (with Project 1) and other
functions. Preliminary data show that fibroblasts and a proposed pathogenic factor, necrotic cells, strongly induce
monocyte differentiation. Second, we hypothesize that TFs expressed in lupus monocytes will induce
differentiation and expression of disease-associated gene inflammation and tissue repair programs. We will
overexpress candidate TFs (based on their expression and genetic association with lupus) in monocytes and
assess inflammation, phagocytosis, and differentiation. Preliminary studies show that the TF overexpression is
feasible, impacts differentiation, and if successful, would allow reliable in vitro generation of differentiated
monocytes for functional studies. Third, to address monocyte roles in lupus nephritis kidneys, we hypothesize
that the proximity of monocytes, fibroblasts and tissue lesions, along with expression of fibroblast-induced
monocyte gene programs, will reflect cell-cell interactions and functions of monocytes in patient kidneys. Using
automated staining, microscopy and image analysis (with the Computational Systems Immunology Core) of
kidney sections from up to 205 clinically-annotated lupus nephritis patients, we will visualize and assess co-
localization of monocytes, fibroblasts, tissue structures/lesions. Preliminary data shows close contacts between
monocytes and fibroblasts and feasibility of scaling our imaging studies to the full cohort. By building on a more
accurate definition of monocytes in human lupus nephritis kidneys, developing methods to study them in vitro
and in human tissues, we will define the origin, differentiation pathways, functions and spatial locations of
monocytes in lupus nephritis, provide a roadmap for mechanistic studies in animal models of disease and identify
approaches to manipulate monocytes as potential therapies for lupus nephritis."
10815719,"The role of fibroblasts in end organ fibrosis is well established, but insights into their roles in chronic
inflammatory diseases in peripheral tissues like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and lupus nephritis (LN) is still
emerging. We identified a highly expanded inflammatory subpopulation of fibroblasts in RA synovial tissue. It
accounts for >50% of all fibroblasts in the synovium in RA, but it is a rare population in osteoarthritis (OA). The
expanded population is distinguished by high expression of CD90 (Thy1), HLA-DR and production of IL-6 and
many chemokines. We hypothesize that these CD90+DR+ fibroblasts are key in driving inflammation directly by
secretion of inflammatory factors and indirectly by recruiting and activating leukocytes to maintain chronic
inflammation. When analyzing single cell RNA-seq data from the RA/SLE Accelerating Medicines Partnership
(AMP) consortium, we found that markers of lining and sublining fibroblasts in synovium were not absolute –
but instead represented a gradient in gene expression in trajectory analysis. We found that this transcriptional
gradient corresponds to an anatomic spatial gradient in the synovium emanating from blood vessels. Our data
suggest that Notch signaling is a dominant driver of the gradient starting with fibroblasts around blood vessels
in the sublining compartment that express Notch3. When we clustered fibroblasts from active lupus nephritis
with fibroblasts from RA synovium, we identified co-clusters of Notch3+ fibroblasts that also express Jag1 in
both diseases.
 Here, we wish to determine if it is Notch 3 signaling on fibroblasts that specifically drives spatial
pattering and sublining fibroblast differentiation. To accomplish this, in Aim 1 we use mixed cell organoids with
endothelial tubules and fibroblasts to compare spatial pattering and differentiation of Notch3 deficient
compared to WT fibroblasts. In Aim 2, we determine the location of the CD90+DR+ inflammatory cytokine
producing fibroblasts and Notch3+ fibroblasts in the synovium and in the kidney in lupus nephritis and
determine which fibroblast population(s) most significantly associate with leukocytes (T, B and macrophage).
In Aim 3 we further activate synovial and kidney-derived fibroblast lines with inflammatory cytokines in the
presence or absence of Notch ligands. We use flow cytometry, RNA-seq, LDA, and trajectory analysis to
compare fibroblast cell states induced in vitro with those found in synovium in RA and kidney in lupus nephritis.
Then, we extend the Notch gradient concept from fibroblasts to adjacent leukocytes by determining if
fibroblast-derived Notch ligands activate attached T cell in organoids. Finally, in Aim 4, we determine if
targeted, conditional deletion of Notch signaling in fibroblasts or targeted conditional deletion of Notch ligands
on fibroblasts prevents inflammatory arthritis in mouse models. Together, these studies will advance our
knowledge of how fibroblasts differentiate and become drivers of inflammation and pathology in chronically
inflamed human tissues, and how they might be targeted therapeutically."
10833531,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
To create a representative paradigm on aging, research participants need to include individuals from
underrepresented populations. Overall, the percentage of the US population of adults aged 65 years and older
is expected to nearly double by 2060 while those 85 years and older will almost triple in the same time frame.
Similarly, the overall US population percentages, based upon race and ethnicity are expected to increase for
people declaring only Black/African American, Hispanic, and Asian. Throughout the lifespan, differential health
gaps and disparities by race and ethnicity are readily identified in the morbidity and mortality data for
communicable and non-communicable diseases. To fully understand and address the complexities of aging
among the growing minority population in the US, research studies need to determine the underlying
mechanisms contributing to the identified health disparities, and test culturally appropriate interventions. One
suggested solution to ensure these imperatives are met is to increase the numbers of minority researchers
who engage in aging research. Researchers from underrepresented groups that share experiential similarities
with study participants, improve the quantity and quality of research engagement by participants, and provide
critical insight to more accurately shape an inclusive aging paradigm. However, MSTEM scientists are not
racially or ethnically representative of the general population. In order to increase minority researchers in aging
and to fully understand the complexities of aging among the growing minority population in the US, we propose
an intervention tailored to support MSTEM students from racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities,
individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, and women in biomedical disciplines with disproportionately low
numbers of women. Investigators from Novices, a Transdisciplinary Research Education Program to Increase
Diversity (INTREPID) in Aging Research will move the students toward engaging in aging research. Framed by
Tinto's model on student persistence in college, INTREPID will provide MSTEM-students a supportive
environment for their successful undergraduate completion, and pursuit of a graduate research degree.
Curriculum based on the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework, offered over two summer institutes of
45 hours each will promote student affinity toward older adults and provide a foundation for their engagement
in the research process. Faculty from the University of Central Florida's transdisciplinary Disability, Aging and
Technology (DAT) Cluster will provide a mentor-mentee matched hands-on research experience that has
linkages to the student's MSTEM major, and establishes and builds the student's identity as a scientist. The
measurable outcomes of INTREPID aim to increase the number of underrepresented and disadvantaged
students who, gain an identity as a scientist, complete their undergraduate MSTEM degrees, and advance to
graduate research programs to prepare them to study health disparities in aging."
10830952,"PROJECT 2 SUMMARY
We demonstrated that two peritransplant infusions of apoptotic donor leukocytes (ADLs) and transient
immunosuppression (TIS) with α-CD40, rapamycin, sTNFR, and α-IL-6R induced long-term (>1 year) tolerance
to islet allografts in 5 of 5 nonsensitized, 1 MHC-II DRB allele-matched nonhuman primates (NHPs). Project 2
will examine the efficacy and mechanisms of the ADL+TIS regimen in a kidney transplant model and apply high-
dimensional immune profiling to guide protocol refinements, with the PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE of developing a safe,
effective, and clinically translatable protocol for inducing stable tolerance in living donor kidney transplantation.
WE HYPOTHESIZE that the ADL+TIS regimen, with modifications deemed necessary to facilitate successful
translation to a solid organ transplant setting and with refinements informed by results of the overall U19 program,
promotes long-term graft survival in living donor kidney transplant models in NHPs through operational tolerance.
To test this hypothesis and facilitate the clinical translation of ADL+TIS, we propose two SPECIFIC AIMS:
AIM #1: To determine the efficacy and mechanisms of ADL infusions combined with transient
immunosuppression in inducing and maintaining tolerance in a NHP renal transplant model
Studies determining the efficacy of the ADL+TIS protocol in achieving operational tolerance of renal allografts in
NHPs will be accompanied by deep immune profiling of blood, graft, spleen, and urine to investigate the effects
of the protocol on the abundance and activation profiles of distinct effector, exhausted, and regulatory immune
cell subsets in various compartments and their spatial organization within graft and spleen.
AIM #2: To study the efficacy and mechanisms of inflammasome inhibition and IL-1b antagonism to
promote renal transplant tolerance induced by ADL infusions and transient immunosuppression in NHPs
Studies in this Aim will determine the ability of strategies inhibiting the inflammasome and its products to
synergize with ADL+TIS in promoting operational tolerance in a renal transplant model in NHPs. Mechanistic
studies will investigate how inflammasome inhibition and IL-1b antagonism modify the effects of ADLs + TIS on
frequencies and activation profiles of myeloid and lymphoid cell subsets in blood, urine, and spleen and their
recruitment to and spatial interaction within coordinated immune regulation domains in the renal allograft.
The SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATION of the proposal lie in the efficacy of the ADL+TIS protocol to deplete and exhaust
allospecific T cells and to create potent immune regulation. The prospects for tolerance induction to renal
transplants in NHPs are high, based on documented tolerance to renal transplants in rodents and islet transplants
in NHPs and opportunities for rational refinements of the strategy created by system-level immune profiling."

Stabilized HIV-1 envelope gp140 trimers such as BG505 SOSIP provide a viable platform to elicit protective
neutralizing antibodies that can be improved upon through various approaches to induce heterologous
neutralizing breadth. BG505 SOSIP trimer immunization elicits protective neutralizing antibodies in rhesus
macaques and is now being tested in several phase I clinical trials, including HVTN 137. Here we will perform
in-depth studies to determine how antibodies that neutralize only the autologous virus and those that also have
activity against heterologous viral variants developed in parallel during BG505 SOSIP immunization of rhesus
macaques using cryopreserved samples. We will then track the antibody germline precursors for these
neutralizing antibodies in other immunized rhesus macaques that share the allele to understand why they
sometimes failed to develop these activities. We will also compare the targets of the neutralizing antibody
responses in BG505 SOSIP immunized human subjects to those recognized in the rhesus macaque model. The
HVTN 137 trial is also administering BG505 SOSIP with different adjuvants and we will investigate how these
impact neutralizing antibody specificities in the human volunteers. Finally, we will isolate neutralizing monoclonal
antibodies from selected BG505 SOSIP immunized rhesus macaques and human subjects to compare the
structural and biophysical properties of antigen recognition. These extensive pre-clinical and clinical resources
combined with our multidisciplinary expertise provides a novel setting in which to address barriers that impede
the development of effective HIV vaccination strategies. If successful, these studies will illuminate new strategies
to improve upon HIV-1 trimer envelope immunogens and adjuvants."
10869938,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The maintenance of genomic integrity after DNA damage and replication stress depends on the coordination of
DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoints. The replication checkpoint pathway, which comprises two critical
protein kinases, ATR and CHK1, has an essential role in this coordination. Inhibition of the replication
checkpoint results in cell lethality in response to replication stress induced by oncogenes, radiation, or
chemotherapeutic agents. Indeed, several replication checkpoint inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials as
potential anticancer agents. Our objective in this application is to provide a detailed mechanistic understanding
of replication checkpoint control, which may help us develop the best strategies for using these checkpoint
inhibitors in cancer therapy.
 We have studied replication checkpoint control for many years. We demonstrated that the ATR-dependent
replication checkpoint can be activated by a variety of DNA lesions. In addition, ATR not only activates CHK1
but also phosphorylates many other substrates, including MCM, H2AX, and others at or near stalled replication
forks to initiate replication checkpoint signaling. Moreover, we have identified and studied several key proteins
such as TOPBP1, ETAA1, and Claspin involved in replication checkpoint control.
 Many key proteins involved in DNA replication and replication checkpoint control are essential for cell
survival. Thus, it remains challenging to fully understand the roles of DNA replication and replication
checkpoint proteins in cell cycle progression. Toward this end, we recently took advantage of the dTAG-
mediated protein degradation system and established cell lines with inducible degradation of several essential
DNA replication and replication checkpoint proteins. Initial analyses of events following the depletion of these
essential proteins revealed some unexpected observations, which led us to re-evaluate replication checkpoint
control and the mechanisms underlying cell cycle transitions.
 In this project, we will determine the essential functions of these DNA replication and checkpoint proteins in
S phase and cell cycle progression. We anticipate that results from these studies will provide a better
understanding of replication checkpoint control, especially how DNA replication and replication checkpoint are
coordinated to ensure S phase progression and cell survival."
10840357,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This research program seeks to reveal how morphological traits are genetically encoded during development
and modified during evolution. Gene regulatory networks are key to generating the physical features of an
organism, as they govern the spatial and temporal expression of each gene during its development. It is now
well accepted that phenotypic differences between species and within populations, including the human
population, are often caused by changes to regulatory networks which alter expression levels or timing.
Despite much progress in this field, our understanding of network function and evolution is lacking in several
major areas: (1) how do new traits emerge from changes to networks? (2) how do networks influence the
behavior of cells in developing tissues? (3) how do mutations that affect gene regulation permeate networks
and populations to cause traits? This research will leverage the highly tractable Drosophila melanogaster
model to answer these questions.
The first theme of this program will address a gene regulatory network controlling a rapidly evolving three-
dimensional anatomical structure in Drosophila. The network which patterns this structure will be dissected to
determine how individual components became integrated into the network. In parallel, the proposed studies will
trace the connections between these networks and the cellular processes that drive morphogenesis. Finally,
genetic changes which alter the three-dimensional shape of these structures will be identified. Performing
these studies will provide an unprecedented view of how gene regulatory networks are assembled and
modified to generate physical differences in tissue structure and produce elaborate morphologies.
The second theme comprises studies on Drosophila pigmentation traits that differ among populations and
between species. Most traits involve multiple loci, and much of this polygenic variation will be derived from
standing variants that persist in populations without phenotypic consequences. The accumulation of multiple
genetic changes will be traced and connected to a putatively adaptive pigmentation trait in Drosophila
melanogaster. The pigmentation trait under study is controlled by Hox transcription factors, which are highly
conserved body-patterning genes shared between flies and humans. This project will examine Hox gene
function and evolution in populations and between species to determine how the gene regulatory network for
this trait arose and diversified. This work will provide a deep molecular understanding of how phenotypes are
generated, informing the nature of these processes in less tractable systems, including humans."

Alzheimer disease (AD). ACS participants age 45-64y will have clinical and psychometric assessments at
entry and every 3 years thereafter (annually for ACS participants >65y); all participants have imaging and fluid
biomarker procedures at baseline and every 3 years thereafter. The Core is essential in that it supplies
carefully characterized participants to all relevant Cores and Projects. The Clinical Core interacts directly or
indirectly on a daily basis with virtually every facet of the ACS PPG.
The functions of the Core are to:
1. Recruit, enroll, and maintain the ACS cohort at ~300 active participants to support the Projects in this
 application. Twenty-five new participants <65y will be enrolled each year to replenish the younger groups
 due to aging into the ≥65y group.
2. Comprehensively assess the ACS participants with well-established clinical and psychometric instruments
 at entry and every three years (annually for participants >65 years of age). With this application, the clinical
 instruments will be augmented with a questionnaire to assess social determinants of health.
3. Obtain blood from all participants for apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping and banking of extracted DNA
 and plasma (supported by the Knight ADRC Genetics and High Throughput –Omics Core with costs
 covered by ACS).

10843881,"Core C: Fluid Biomarker Project Summary/Abstract
 Biomarker data have been critical for defining Alzheimer disease (AD) as a continuum, with pathology
 developing decades prior to the onset of cognitive symptoms that eventually progress to dementia. This
 concept has impacted disease nomenclature, diagnostic criteria, prognostic potential, and clinical trial
 design. Revisions in diagnostic criteria to incorporate biomarker results have been proposed in order to
 increase the confidence of AD as the underlying etiology of a clinical impairment and to permit a diagnosis of
 AD across the disease continuum, perhaps even in the asymptomatic period. Individuals in this preclinical
 stage (as in the ACS) are receiving intense focus as a targeted population for prevention trials aimed at
 identifying disease-modifying therapies that have the best chance of preserving normal cognitive function.
 Since study inception, the Fluid Biomarker Core (Core C) has developed and implemented standard
operating procedures and efficient workflows for the standardized collection, storage, tracking and sharing of
fasted CSF and plasma samples. The ACS has identified biomarker abnormalities that characterize
preclinical AD, defined when these changes develop during the adult lifespan and how they progress. We
are now poised to expand our analyses to characterize the progression of preclinical AD over its 20+ year
course, investigate whether the biomarker changes observed during this preclinical period are predictive of
transition to symptomatic AD, and assess factors that may accelerate or retard this transition. In the next
funding cycle we will extend our proven track record for excellence by continuing to provide the infrastructure
for the collection, storage, and distribution of samples to Project 2 (for the measurement and evaluation of
established, emerging and novel biomarkers [e.g., inflammation] to predict clinical progression) and to
outside AD investigators studying preclinical AD. Fluid biomarker data generated in Project 2 will also be
used by other ACS Projects in their investigations of biomarker associations with imaging measures of
neuroinflammation (via DBSI) and tangle load (via tau PET) (Project 1), the gut microbiome (Project 3) and
physical activity and cardiovascular risk factors (Project 4). In keeping with our emphasis on biomarker
assay rigor, reproducibility and standardization efforts, Core C will also perform annual assay validation and
lot bridging experiments in support of sample analyses carried out in Project 2. We will also continue our
interactions and collaborations with other domestic and international research groups (industrial, academic
and clinical) to foster quality control (QC) efforts required for sample collection protocol harmonization and
biomarker assay standardization. To this end, we propose the following three Specific Aims: 1) Continue to
maintain and grow a biorepository of fasted CSF and plasma for present and future studies of aging and AD;
2) Coordinate the distribution of CSF and plasma samples to qualified investigators; and 3) Participate in
studies regarding fluid biomarker assay development/validation and protocol QC and standardization efforts."

Brain amyloidosis is necessary but insufficient for the development of symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD).
Whether and when an individual with brain amyloidosis develops symptomatic AD likely depends on a myriad
of additional biological, demographic, social and environmental factors. Besides brain amyloidosis, many other
pathophysiological processes are involved in AD and could potentially affect development of symptomatic AD,
including tauopathy, synaptic dysfunction, neuronal injury/death, astrocytosis/microgliosis and inflammation.
Demographic factors including race and social determinants of health (SDOH), including discrimination and
adversity, adverse early-life experiences, current stress and social support, and neighborhood level
disadvantages, could also play a role in modifying symptom onset. In this study, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) biomarkers that represent diverse aspects of AD pathophysiology will be measured and used to predict
the onset of symptomatic AD. The effects of demographic factors and SDOH will be examined to identify
factors that modify expression of symptomatic AD and may underlie the disparities in AD prevalence in certain
populations, such as African Americans. Fluid biomarkers will be used to examine the potential mechanisms by
which demographic factors and SDOH exert their influence on symptomatic AD. Whether demographic factors
and SDOH affect the pathological progression of AD will also be explored. Additionally, to better understand
the complex role of inflammation in AD, high throughput proteomic data have been analyzed to identify plasma
and CSF proteins related to inflammation that change in asymptomatic brain amyloidosis and symptomatic AD.
Because these candidate biomarkers of inflammation have different biological functions compared to the
biomarkers currently studied in our cohort, one or more candidate biomarkers may provide novel insights into
AD biology and potentially improve AD diagnostics. Further, all fluid biomarkers will be compared with imaging
measures of inflammation and tauopathy (Project 1), the gut microbiome and gut function (Project 3), and
physical activity and cardiovascular risk factors (Project 4). These analyses will better characterize the fluid
biomarkers and may indicate the pathophysiological processes that are modified by the gut microbiome and
gut function, physical activity, and cardiovascular risk factors. Overall, this Project will use fluid biomarkers to
better understand the complex biological, demographic, social and environmental factors that mediate the
relationship between brain amyloidosis and symptomatic AD."
10843889,"Project 3: Project Summary/Abstract
The gut microbiome (GM) is comprised of thousands of microbial taxa, with a vast repertoire of functional
pathways that interact with the host environment. Dysbiosis of the GM is associated with numerous disease
states within and beyond the gastrointestinal tract. GM dysbiosis has also been implicated in Alzheimer disease
(AD), with recent data demonstrating AD patients have distinct GM taxonomic composition from those of healthy
controls. Further, these taxa correlate with presence of AD biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well
as dysregulation of a key inflammatory pathway. However, knowledge about changes in the GM prior to
symptomatic AD onset is limited. The rationale behind our proposal is that changes in the GM that occur prior
to symptomatic AD are critical for understanding AD pathogenesis. This proposal pursues three aims: 1)
Characterize gut bacterial content and organ permeability in adults at different stages of AD, 2) Identify
longitudinal changes in bacterial content and organ permeability in cognitively normal individuals
without or with preclinical AD, and symptomatic AD, and 3) Associate bacterial content and organ
permeability with other modalities of AD biomarkers obtained from other Projects and Cores of this PPG.
Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that cognitively normal individuals with preclinical AD (e.g., amyloid positive)
already exhibit altered GM composition and increased gut permeability. To address this hypothesis, we will
leverage our unique set of stool samples from healthy individuals without preclinical AD (n=400), cognitively
normal with preclinical AD (n=150), and symptomatic AD (n=50) individuals from ACS and other Knight ADRC-
affiliated studies. By combining metagenomic sequencing, metatranscriptomic profiling, and detection of fecal
and serum markers of permeability and inflammation, we will determine distinct compositional and functional
features of preclinical and symptomatic AD. Based on these characterizations, Aim2 will test the hypothesis that
these features correlate with AD progression, with symptomatic AD individuals displaying the greatest shifts over
time. Aim 3 will connect our findings with other biomarkers identified in the PPG, with the hypothesis that
changes in GM and organ permeability will correlate with longitudinal changes in CSF tau and p-tau, PET tau
uptake, CSF and plasma inflammatory markers, and physical activity. This proposal is innovative and
significant because our multidisciplinary team will identify early biomarkers that precede the onset of
symptomatic AD. Our work will impact and advance AD research by characterizing GM dysbiosis during AD
pathogenesis as well as establish a foundation for cost-effective, noninvasive measures to diagnose AD."
10843892,"Project 4: Project Summary/Abstract
Physical activity is emerging as a potential non-pharmacological intervention to reduce the risk of developing
symptomatic AD. However, there are several unresolved issues regarding the potential role of physical activity.
First, the neurobiological mechanisms by which physical activity may be protective are unclear. While there is
evidence from rodent studies that exercise-induced increase in trophic factors reduce AD pathology, enhance
hippocampal neuroplasticity and improve hippocampal-dependent memory, this pathway has not been fully
tested in humans. Second, there is limited understanding of the factors that contribute to individual differences
in the effectiveness of physical activity. Third, the majority of studies have used self-report measures with
variable evidence of reliability and validity, which could lead to biased estimation of effects. Lastly, the effect of
physical activity on core AD pathology has been less examined with mixed findings in the literature. Project 4
will address these gaps and limitations by testing the mechanistic model supported by animal work in humans
and determining factors that may moderate the beneficial effects of physical activity, both cross-sectionally and
longitudinally. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that higher levels of physical activity will be associated with
benefits for neuronal/synaptic integrity and hence medial temporal lobe structure and episodic memory both
directly by reduced amyloid deposition and tau phosphorylation (via increased trophic factors) and indirectly by
mitigating the negative effects of AD pathology. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that vascular health and the
response of trophic factors to an acute bout of exercise moderate the effects of physical activity on AD
biomarkers, medial temporal lobe structure and episodic memory. Exploratory Aim 3 will examine the role of
stress exposure (Clinical Core) and reactivity, inflammation (Projects 1 & 2), and the gut microbiome (Project
3) in the effects of physical activity. Physical activity will be robustly characterized with objective measures of
cardiorespiratory fitness and actigraphy-derived estimates of physical activity over 7 days. We will incorporate
blood measures of trophic factors, CSF measures of neuronal integrity (Fluid Biomarker Core), structural MRI
and DTI measures of medial temporal lobe structure (Project 1) as well as CSF and PET measures of AD
biomarkers (Projects 1 & 2). Importantly, this Project represents a critical initial step in a line of research to
determine the degree to which physical activity, directly and/or indirectly, influences the transition from
cognitive normality to symptomatic AD."
10811598,"Project Summary/Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with impaired social
communications and behavioral abnormalities, which affects ~1 in 54 children in the United States (CDC.gov).
SCN2A, encoding neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2, has been identified as one of the leading
genes associated with ASD. We have characterized a novel Scn2a-deficient mouse model that is generated via
targeted gene-trap knockout (gtKO) strategy and possesses a built-in genetic rescue element. Our preliminary
data revealed profound behavioral abnormalities in homozygous Scn2agtKO/gtKO mice including anxiety-like
behaviors, impaired nesting and social deficits. We also identified elevated excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance in
pyramidal neurons of mPFC, which has been implicated in ASD and social deficits. However, a critical gap exists
regarding how in vivo neuronal firings in mPFC are affected by elevated E/I balance and to what extent the
manipulation of E/I balance will alter the behavioral outcomes in Scn2agtKO/gtKO mice. To address this gap, we
propose to test an overarching hypothesis that Scn2a deficiency increases E/I balance, impairs neuronal
responses in mPFC, and results in social deficits that can be rescued with targeted genetic and pharmacological
interventions. In Aim 1, we will assess the synaptic properties and in vivo firing of neurons in mPFC using brain-
slice patch-clamp recording and Neuropixels in vivo recording. Our findings are expected to provide cellular-level
and local network level neuropathological mechanisms of Scn2a deficiency. In Aim 2, we will determine neuronal
firings and behavioral outcomes in response to manipulating E/I balance in mPFC microcircuit using optogenetics
and chemogenetics. Our findings will bolster the significance of E/I balance modulation for correction of
behavioral deficits. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the efficacy of timed genetic and pharmacological rescue to
determine optimal windows for intervention. Our study is significant in the following ways: i) SCN2A deficiency
to be studied is among the leading monogenetic forms of ASD; ii) Excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance of mPFC
microcircuit to be thoroughly dissected is closely associated with social deficits; and iii) Genetic rescue and
pharmacological intervention to be tested are of clear clinical relevance, and will provide translational basis to
inform therapeutic development for the treatment of Scn2a-deficiency related disorders. Our study has the
following innovations: i) use of novel Scn2agtKO/gtKO mice that display profound cellular and behavioral deficits; ii)
innovative ways to achieve genetic and pharmacological rescue; and iii) use of cutting-edge technologies
including high density Neuropixels in vivo recordings. The applicant is an early stage investigator (ESI), whose
team has extensive expertise in sodium channel electrophysiology, animal behaviors, genetics and
pharmacology. The team is well suited to carry out the proposed work to its full completion within the project
timeframe, and generate impactful outcomes to advance the field."
10829274,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Latino children experience disparities in asthma control and have worse functional outcomes related to poorly
controlled asthma compared to non-Latino White children, including more school absences, emergency
department visits, and hospitalizations for asthma. These disparities persist despite the benefits of asthma self-
management interventions. A significant and growing percentage of Latino children live in poverty, which further
increases their risk for uncontrolled asthma. For low-SES Latino children, psychosocial stress is an unaddressed
factor in asthma disparities. Existing interventions rarely target psychosocial processes to address the role of
stress in asthma control. However, research on coping offers insight into potential intervention approaches that
would buffer the effects of stress and reduce asthma disparities for low-SES Latino children. Coping is a key
modifiable factor that lies “midstream” between upstream social determinants of health and downstream
disparities in health outcomes. In particular, secondary control coping (i.e., efforts to accommodate/adapt to
stressors, such as acceptance and cognitive restructuring) has been linked to better asthma control for children
in low-SES contexts. Therefore, the purpose of the current R01 proposal is to test the effectiveness and
mediators of Adapt 2 Asthma (A2A), a bilingual family-based coping skills + asthma management intervention
tailored to the stressors, strengths, and cultural beliefs of low-SES Latino families. 280 low-SES Latino families
of children ages 9-13 years old with asthma will be identified and enrolled from community primary care clinics
and randomly assigned to either A2A or a standard asthma self-management (AM) control arm. We will assess
children’s asthma control, quality of life, lung function, school absences, and emergency department visits as
the outcomes of the intervention. We will also examine child mediational pathways (child coping and mood and
behavior symptoms) and parent mediational pathways (parent coping and depressive symptoms) of the
intervention. Assessments will occur at pre- and post-intervention and at 6 and 12-month follow-up timepoints
using child and parent report, spirometry, and school records. The successful completion of this R01 would
provide evidence of the effectiveness and mediators of A2A for low-SES Latino children, a population

implementation trial of A2A in primary care. The long-term goal of this line of research is to reduce disparities in
asthma control and its health consequences affecting low-SES Latino children and similar underserved youth
populations. The knowledge gained would improve the health of low-SES Latino children and reduce the public
health burden related to pediatric asthma, a condition with a significant cost to society."
10939408,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Latino children experience disparities in asthma control and have worse functional outcomes related to poorly
controlled asthma compared to non-Latino White children, including more school absences, emergency
department visits, and hospitalizations for asthma. These disparities persist despite the benefits of asthma self-
management interventions. A significant and growing percentage of Latino children live in poverty, which further
increases their risk for uncontrolled asthma. For low-SES Latino children, psychosocial stress is an unaddressed
factor in asthma disparities. Existing interventions rarely target psychosocial processes to address the role of
stress in asthma control. However, research on coping offers insight into potential intervention approaches that
would buffer the effects of stress and reduce asthma disparities for low-SES Latino children. Coping is a key
modifiable factor that lies “midstream” between upstream social determinants of health and downstream
disparities in health outcomes. In particular, secondary control coping (i.e., efforts to accommodate/adapt to
stressors, such as acceptance and cognitive restructuring) has been linked to better asthma control for children
in low-SES contexts. Therefore, the purpose of the current R01 proposal is to test the effectiveness and
mediators of Adapt 2 Asthma (A2A), a bilingual family-based coping skills + asthma management intervention
tailored to the stressors, strengths, and cultural beliefs of low-SES Latino families. 280 low-SES Latino families
of children ages 9-13 years old with asthma will be identified and enrolled from community primary care clinics
and randomly assigned to either A2A or a standard asthma self-management (AM) control arm. We will assess
children’s asthma control, quality of life, lung function, school absences, and emergency department visits as
the outcomes of the intervention. We will also examine child mediational pathways (child coping and mood and
behavior symptoms) and parent mediational pathways (parent coping and depressive symptoms) of the
intervention. Assessments will occur at pre- and post-intervention and at 6 and 12-month follow-up timepoints
using child and parent report, spirometry, and school records. The successful completion of this R01 would
provide evidence of the effectiveness and mediators of A2A for low-SES Latino children, a population
underserved by current intervention approaches. Our results are expected to lead to a subsequent multi-site
implementation trial of A2A in primary care. The long-term goal of this line of research is to reduce disparities in
asthma control and its health consequences affecting low-SES Latino children and similar underserved youth
populations. The knowledge gained would improve the health of low-SES Latino children and reduce the public
health burden related to pediatric asthma, a condition with a significant cost to society."

Clinician scientists fulfil a unique role by integrating discovery science with clinical practice and therapeutic
intervention. However, their numbers are in decline, creating the need for flexible training and research
opportunities to ensure their future. The Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute’s (CCTSI) T32
Post-Doctoral Program will address the need for highly qualified and competent translational scientists by
providing a responsive and evidence-informed program, a stimulating environment with well-equipped facilities,
a community of practice for translational scientists, and the explicit value that Diversity Accelerates Research
and Translation (DART). We request support for 4 post-doctoral trainee slots of two years each. Our
program is novel in that it expands the translational spectrum by recognizing the importance of shared,
naturally occurring models of disease among animals and humans to push discovery, which we coin T0.5. Our
program will involve both doctorally prepared clinicians (physicians (MD), pharmacists (PharmD), physical
therapists (DPT), nurses (DPN) and others) at the University of Colorado who will complete the Master of
Science in Clinical Science (MSCS) degree and veterinarians completing a PhD from Colorado State
University, a partnering university. Trainees of our interprofessional program will be highly qualified and
thoroughly prepared to be effective team members and translational scientists that fuel discovery that is
translated to communities for improved health and lives of its citizens. Development of translational scientists
that characterize Domain Expert, Rigorous Researcher, Boundary Crosser, Process Innovator, Team Player,
Skilled Communicator, and Systems Thinker will be emphasized through completion of a degree program
(MSCS or PhD), meaningful immersion experiences for translational science and translational research,
effective mentorship and peer support, and alleviating “pull factors” by creating a community of practice
through our Translational Scientist seminars. Pull factors are demands that compete or conflict with trainee
engagement, integration, and performance that ultimately diminish persistence. Clinical and translational
science and research requires a shift from an individual-based approach to a teamwork model. Team member
competency development will be kick-started by early participation in our Teaming and Leading program. The
One Health framework will be used to highlight the need for teaming and permit application of all translational
scientist competencies recognizing that achievement of optimal health is reliant on the interconnection among
people, animals, and their shared environment across eco-health system levels (local, regional, national and
global). A culminating activity will be trainee led interdisciplinary teams participating in a One Health Hackathon
focused on antimicrobial resistance. Long term-evaluation and continuous quality improvement will be used to
guide programmatic efforts and respond to changing demands. Evaluative efforts will focus on the program’s
ability to develop a diverse group of persistent team oriented translational scientists."

Maternal mortality and AIDS are among the leading causes of death in reproductive-age women globally due to
unintended pregnancy and the disproportionate burden of HIV infection. While effective prevention methods
exist, only 21% of women have access to modern contraceptives and adherence to HIV PrEP regimen is poor
in many HIV-endemic regions. Multipurpose prevention technologies (MPT) aim to synchronize contraceptive
delivery with HIV PrEP, offering a patient-centered approach to provide dual coverage to sexually active women
in a single product. A long-acting unified delivery product that can be administered in a discreet manner could
reduce stigma around contraceptives and HIV PrEP, thereby improving uptake and adherence to combination
prevention products. Our goal is to develop a long-acting delivery implant of etonogestrel (ENG) and islatravir
(ISL) drugamer with an unprecedented 2-year release duration for pregnancy and HIV prevention that eliminates
further need of adherence. A new subcutaneous nanofluidic multipurpose implant (NanoMPI) will be brought
together with a new polymeric prodrug technology termed “drugamer”, to achieve this innovative product
candidate that delivers ultra-long acting ENG+ISL drug dosing durations. The NanoMPI leverages a nanofluidic
membrane with nanochannels and a single drugamer reservoir to achieve zero-order release kinetics through
passive diffusion without pumping mechanisms, permitting discreet, user-independent dosing. Key product
attributes will include drug stabilization on the multi-year timeframe, minimized early- and late-stage burst release
and pharmacokinetic (PK) tailing, zero-order drug release kinetics tailored to the individual drug PK/PD
(pharmacodynamic) requirements, user-independent dosing, and retrievability. The project is structured around
3 specific aims: 1) to develop optimized ENG-ISL drugamer formulations that stabilize the drugs and exhibit the
desired zero order release profiles, in concert with the optimization of the NanoMPI device for 2-year sustained
release; 2) to assess pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of the lead ENG-ISL NanoMPI device for 2 years
in pigtail macaques; and 3) to evaluate contraception and HIV PrEP efficacy of ENG-ISL NanoMPI in pigtail
macaques via repeated low-dose vaginal challenge and develop a PK/PD model. We will use a milestone-driven
research approach to advance the ENG-ISL NanoMPI technology towards the ultimate goal of clinical translation,
leveraging the interdisciplinary team’s experience in drugamer technology, drug delivery, pre-clinical and clinical
HIV prevention studies, and hormonal contraceptive and antiretroviral pharmacology. Importantly, the NanoMPI
addresses user preferences for a dual prevention product, discretion and longer dosing duration. Successful
completion will generate a versatile MPT platform that could be adopted for other drug combinations and
preventative strategies."

Optimizing uptake of HIV testing is critical to meeting 95-95-95 goals in sub-Saharan Africa. As 30% of new
infections in occur within married or cohabitating couples, maximizing testing among individuals who are or
may someday be in serious heterosexual relationships has been identified as one of the most cost-effective
strategies to curb the epidemic. Childbearing is highly valued throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, and fears of
relationship dissolution and loss of the ability to have children remain significant barriers to HIV testing. The
expanding availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) presents an opportunity to counter these fears with
strategic communication (NOT-MH-21-105) that reassure couples of their ability to have a healthy family even
if one or both members are HIV positive. Our long-term objective is to leverage the growing availability of PrEP
to determine if and how a communication strategy focused on relationship preservation and safer conception
can increase testing and entry into treatment (antiretroviral therapy) or prevention (PrEP) among partnered
individuals in Uganda. We recently successfully piloted this communication strategy within Uganda’s assisted
partner notification program (APN). In this R34, we will: (1) conduct formative research to expand the
communication strategy into a multi-component intervention with broader reach; and (2) conduct a pilot trial of
the intervention, PrEPing Healthy Families. To achieve Aim 1, we will work with a community advisory board
(CAB) of providers to a) create communication materials (brochures, scripts) and counseling protocols tailored
to clients and partners across the array of couples’ testing pathways in APN and antenatal care (ANC). As
CAB providers pilot materials and tracking systems with clients and partners during this development phase,
study staff will conduct field observations and qualitative interviews focused on feasibility and acceptability,
informing revised intervention materials. To achieve Aim 2, we will collect baseline data at APN and ANC
clinics within two large public healthcare facilities over nine months. Sites will then be randomized to implement
PrEPing Healthy Families or their existing communication approach (usual care) over the next nine months.
We will collect mixed-methods data on feasibility and acceptability through intervention tracking in APN/ANC
registers, client exit surveys, and qualitative interviews with clients, partners and providers. Through register
extraction, we will examine limited efficacy on outcomes that would be relevant to a larger trial (partner HIV
testing, client service uptake initiation of PrEP/ART), and explore potential moderators. Overall, results will
yield important insights in a promising new communication strategy (NOT-MH-21-105) that may connect more
individuals to the HIV cascades of care for treatment or prevention and prepare us for a large-scale, cluster
randomized controlled trial to determine impact on testing and initiation of PrEP/ART."

Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) can result from combat-related traumatic brain injury
(TBI), a well-documented phenomenon that has caused substantial neurologic disease
in Veterans, most recently in relation to conflicts in the Middle East (>350,000 cases of
combat-related TBI since 2000). Unfortunately, current treatments for PTE are of limited
efficacy, and thus many Veterans with PTE do not have effective seizure control. PTE
often manifests as a form of temporal lobe epilepsy, which involves cellular and
functional circuit alterations in the hippocampal region of the brain. In the healthy
hippocampus, dentate granule cells (DGCs) form a principal cell layer that prevent
hyperexcitability through their low firing frequency and relatively hyperpolarized resting
membrane potentials. Additionally, the dentate gyrus is a region of ongoing
neurogenesis, in which new DGCs are generated throughout adult life and integrate into
the existing circuitry, in a process critical to learning and memory. TBI and epilepsy
involve the aberrant maturation and integration of adult-born DGCs in the hippocampus,
which is thought to disrupt hippocampal function and increase brain excitability leading
to seizures. In this region, parvalbumin-positive (PV+) inhibitory basket interneurons not
only mediate feed-forward inhibition, but release the neurotransmitter GABA onto
immature granule cells and neuroblasts, which modulates circuit integration of these
cells as they mature in the hippocampus. Although these interneurons are preserved in
many animal models of epilepsy, PV+ basket cells undergo numerous functional and
network changes, including reduced excitatory input, increased output failure, and
presynaptic calcium channel dysfunction. Prior hypotheses have examined the potential
direct contribution of PV+ cell dysfunction to hippocampal hyperexcitability after TBI. In
this proposal, I hypothesize that dysfunction of PV+ basket cells after TBI contributes
indirectly to hyperexcitability, by driving aberrant maturation and integration of adult-born
DGCs. I will investigate how TBI impacts PV+ basket cell function at the cellular and
network level, how this dysfunction influences development and integration of adult-born
DGCs, and whether changes in PV-cell specific microcircuit structure and function drive
whole animal seizure susceptibility following TBI. This proposal will use transgenic mice
to selectively target the PV+ basket cell population for expression of calcium indicators,
excitatory channelrhodopsins, or specific synthetic receptors to measure PV-cell specific
network activity after TBI, as well as the functional outputs of these cells. I will also
combine these techniques with retrovirus-mediated labeling of adult-born DGCs, to
determine whether changes in post-TBI PV+ basket cell function alter the maturation,
integration, or circuit dynamics of adult-born DGCs after TBI. Finally, I will manipulate
activity of the PV+ basket cells in vivo to assess their role in neuronal circuit rewiring
after TBI, and modulate their activity after TBI in hopes of reducing seizure susceptibility.
The knowledge gathered from this study will help guide future work that will refine our
understanding of interneuron dysfunction for post-TBI injured Veterans using clinical
data, which might one day be able to prevent the development of PTE."

 The molecular heterogeneity of cancers poses a major hurdle for treatment and drug discovery efforts.
Previous studies have addressed this challenge by characterizing distinct molecular subtypes of specific cancers
(e.g., breast cancers), based on cell type-specific patterns of gene expression. To interrogate the molecular
underpinnings of cancer subtypes, the Kraus Lab has developed a robust and multi-faceted computational
pipeline that integrates data from various genomic assays to define a Total Functional Score of Enhancer
Elements (TFSEE) for each subtype. One outcome of this method is the identification of cancer subtype-
enriched transcription factors (TFs) that promote subtype-specific enhancer formation and drive downstream
transcriptional outcomes. In breast cancers, several TFSEE-identified subtype-specific TFs are uniquely
required for the growth of the cognate breast cancer subtype, but do not affect the proliferation or viability of
other subtypes. Recent studies have also shown that ADP-ribosylation (ADPRylation), a post-translational
modification of proteins, varies dramatically across the different subtypes of breast cancers. ADPRylation is
mediated by the Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes, including PARP-1, a nuclear enzyme
which is the target of FDA-approved PARP inhibitor drugs. PARPs are well known for the roles in DNA repair,
but recent studies suggest an important BRCA1/2-independent role in transcriptional regulation as well. In
preliminary analyses, we have identified a cohort of cancer-related TFs that are ADPRylated in breast cancers.
 The long-term objective of these studies is to achieve a better understanding of the molecular and
biochemical mechanisms underlying the regulation of breast cancer subtype-specific TFs by ADPRylation, as
well as the responses of distinct breast cancer subtypes to PARP inhibitors. Our hypothesis is that ADPRylation
of subtype-specific TFs dictates their function and may influence the response of breast cancer cells to PARP
inhibitors. We have proposed a project that will use an integrated set of biochemical, molecular, cell-based,
mouse-based, genomic, and proteomic assays to test our overarching and specific mechanistic hypotheses.
Specifically, we will: (1) Identify TFs that are ADPRylated in breast cancers (Aim 1), (2) Determine how
ADPRylation of TFs affects their molecular and biochemical functions (Aim 2), and (3) Determine the effects of
TF ADPRylation on the responses of breast cancer cells to clinically used PARP inhibitors (Aim 3). These studies
will take advantage of the expertise of the PI’s lab in PARPs, ADPRylation, enhancer function, and gene
regulation in cancer. Although focused initially on breast cancers, our results should be broadly applicable across
a variety of cancer types. Our integrative approach using ‘omics’ and functional assays will provide new insights
into the regulation of TF ADP-ribosylation in breast cancers that will serve as a model for how to explore PARP
function and ADP-ribosylation in cancer cells. The use of mouse-based models and patient samples will allow
us to explore the clinical relevance of our mechanistic results. We anticipate that our studies will suggest new
avenues for the therapeutic potential of PARP inhibitors in cancers beyond DNA repair pathways."

 Lysosomes function as critical nodes for macromolecular recycling, metabolic rewiring, and pro-growth
signaling in cells. Accordingly, defects in lysosome function underlie degenerative diseases and aging while
hyperactivation of lysosomes are associated with cancer. Prior studies have shown that highly aggressive
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) cells upregulate lysosome biogenesis and activity to facilitate
degradation, clearance and recycling of incoming cargo material delivered by increased rates of autophagy and
macropinocytosis. Whether qualitative differences endow PDA lysosomes with unique structural and functional
properties to cope with a higher demand for substrate clearance remains unknown. To answer this question, we
have conducted the first comparative proteomics analysis of lysosomes isolated from PDA versus normal cells
and have identified members of the Ferlin family of membrane repair factors, Myoferlin and Dysferlin, as
selectively enriched on the membrane of PDA lysosomes. We propose that Ferlin proteins confer
increased protection against lysosomal membrane stress in PDA cells.
 Ferlin proteins are normally localized on the plasma membrane of cell types subjected to heightened
mechanical stress, such as skeletal muscle, where they facilitate repair of the lipid bilayer. Accordingly, mutations
in DYSF are associated with two forms of muscular dystrophy whereby impaired membrane resealing
compromises myoblast maturation, fusion and plasma membrane repair. Therefore, we hypothesize that PDA
cells hijack and repurpose Ferlin proteins at the lysosome membrane to protect the integrity of this organelle. In
support of this hypothesis, our preliminary findings show that PDA lysosomes are more resistant to acute
chemically induced membrane permeabilization relative to normal cells. Mechanistically, lysosome localization
of MYOF is necessary and sufficient for maintenance of lysosome quality control and its suppression leads to
profound defects in lysosome morphology, PDA cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth. The goal of this
study is to investigate how MYOF functions to protect the lysosome membrane in mechanistic detail and to
determine the impact of blocking lysosome quality control on cellular metabolism, pro-growth signaling and
disease progression. In summary, our discovery and proposed studies will be the first to determine a novel
function for Ferlin proteins at the lysosome membrane and provide insight into how enhanced lysosome quality
control regulates cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis."

The survival of living organisms depends on the timely and accurate duplication of chromosomal DNA. In all
domains of life, the onset of DNA replication (or initiation) relies on dedicated initiator proteins that bind
genomic sites, termed replication origins, and help load replicative helicases onto DNA. In eukaryotes, the
initiator is the origin recognition complex (ORC), which recruits and deposits the Mcm2-7 helicase motor
module onto DNA to ‘license’ origins. Although core replication initiation factors are conserved across most
eukaryotes and are well-studied in budding yeast, important differences exist with respect to origin recognition
and the regulation of origin licensing between S. cerevisiae and higher eukaryotes. Numerous outstanding
questions therefore remain in the metazoan system regarding origin recruitment and function of core and
accessory DNA replication initiation factors, and the specific contributions of chromatin-associated proteins to
these events. In this proposal, we aim to define at a mechanistic level in metazoan systems how ORC-
dependent DNA remodeling contributes to Mcm2-7 loading, how disease-linked mutations alter initiator
activities, and how ORC-partner proteins promote chromosomal recruitment and function of the initiator, by
integrating biochemical, structural, and cell-based approaches. The findings from this work will have broad
implications for multiple scientific fields, as they will not only help generate models for origin specification,
origin processing, and origin licensing in metazoans, but also contribute to our understanding of DNA- and
chromatin-dependent macromolecular machines. Our studies are also of significant biomedical relevance since
the failure to precisely replicate chromosomal DNA causes genome instability, which in turn underpins many
human diseases, including cancer. In the long-term, the outcomes of our efforts thus have the potential to
provide important starting points for the development of novel therapeutic strategies."

In the United States, subdural hematomas (SDHs) are projected to become the most common cranial
neurosurgical condition by 2030. This has major public health implications, as nearly 50% of SDH patients are
dead or severely disabled at three months. Despite its importance, there is very little study of this disease at the
population-level, particularly with regard to outcomes after patients leave the hospital. Nearly 1 in 6 patients that survive
an initial SDH hospitalization are rehospitalized within 90 days, and this risk may be impacted heavily by social
determinants of health (SocDH). Regardless, there is no predictive model available to identify SDH survivors at high risk
of rehospitalization. Further, SDHs are tightly associated with premorbid antithrombotic use, and these medications are
commonly held at the time of presentation, but there is little evidence about the risks and benefits of antithrombotic
resumption in SDH survivors. To address these limitations, we will conduct the first population-level study of SDH
outcomes in the United States. We will accomplish this relatively quickly and at low cost by utilizing the well-validated
infrastructure of the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study, which has been studying population-level
outcomes in stroke and intracranial hemorrhage for more than 30 years. This infrastructure will allow us to determine
the 3-year risk of major ischemic and hemorrhagic events after an SDH and determine the predictors for each outcome.
We will also a build a predictive model of 90-day rehospitalization or death among SDH patients that utilizes both
clinical and SocDH variables. We will use conventional predictive modeling along with modern machine learning
techniques, allowing us to maximize predictive ability and potentially identify new variables and interactions that lead to
adverse outcomes in SDH survivors. Through this proposal, Dr. Robinson will become an expert in the epidemiology of
SDH and in the use of novel data science techniques to analyze large clinical databases. These skills will prepare him
to become the next PI of the overall Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study. Dr. Robinson will conduct this
work under the guidance of a distinguished mentorship committee: Dr. Brett Kissela, a stroke epidemiologist with
expertise in using big data techniques; Dr. Dan Woo, a clinician scientist that studies disparities in intracerebral
hemorrhage; Opeolu Adeoye, a neurointensivist and researcher with expertise in acute care research; and Hooman
Kamel, a stroke epidemiologist and neurointensivist with expertise in the population-level study of SDHs."

People who inject drugs (PWID) account for the majority of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in the U.S.
Improving the HCV care continuum, with particular attention to the complication of HIV-coinfection, is critical
to achieving HCV elimination. Heterogeneous injection and sexual networks among PWID can significantly
affect HCV and HIV transmission and intervention outcomes. Although empirical studies on the efficacy of
interventions to improve the HCV care continuum in the direct-acting antiviral (DAA) era have begun to
accumulate, there remains a lack of understanding of the population level impact and cost-effectiveness of
these interventions to inform policymaking. My long-term goal is to develop mathematical and statistical
simulation models to inform health policies relating to infectious disease control. The overall objective for
this application, which is a critical step toward attaining my long-term goal, is to develop a dynamic agent-
based network model of HCV and HIV transmission among PWID, to determine the population-level impact
and cost-effectiveness of interventions to improve the HCV care continuum. My central hypothesis is that
interventions that target multiple stages of the care continuum, taking account of individual characteristics,
service environment, and meso/macro-level contexts, will have significant population-level impact in
decreasing HCV and HIV infections and associated complications while being cost-effective. The central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Identify social determinants of the HCV care
continuum outcomes among PWID, and effective interventions to improve these outcomes in the DAA era;
2) Determine the population-level impact and cost-effectiveness of different interventions to improve the
HCV care continuum among PWID; 3) Identify the determinants of differences in population-level impact of
interventions to improve the HCV care continuum based on specific features of PWID networks. I will
pursue these aims using systematic review and meta-analysis (Aim 1), expanding our model of HCV
transmission via injection network to incorporate sexual network and HIV transmission (Aim 2), and fitting
the model to different PWID networks and evaluate impact across the networks (Aim 3). To complete the
research and advance my career, I will obtain research training in evidence synthesis, Bayesian methods
for model calibration, and health economics, and professional training in scientific communication,
leadership, and collaboration, in the interdisciplinary environment of the Department of Health Policy at the
Stanford School of Medicine. The expected outcome is a novel model platform to evaluate complex
HIV/HCV intervention strategies for improving the health of PWID. The proposed research is significant
because the results will provide systematic understanding of social determinants of HCV care in PWID and
essential evidence on the population-level impact and cost-effectiveness of interventions to improve the
HCV care continuum in different PWID populations to inform policymaking on HCV elimination."
10820487,"Project Summary: Neurological disorders such as epilepsy and memory loss develop several years after
traumatic brain injury (TBI) and are a major source of physical disability and economic burden. The delay
between the initial trauma and eventual disability results from progressive neuropathology that could be limited
by early interventions. However, mechanisms by which TBI impacts memory and seizure susceptibility are not
fully understood. The hippocampal dentate gyrus, a circuit critical for memory processing, a key regulator of
information transfer from entorhinal cortex to hippocampus, and a niche region for adult neurogenesis, is a
focus of neuronal damage and increased excitability after TBI. Although adult born granule cells (abGCs) are
implicated in memory processing, the contribution of abGCs to dentate spikes which represent entorhinal
cortex to dentate information flow and support memory consolidation is not known and how injury-induced
changes in neurogenesis affect memory processing is not fully understood. Unexpectedly, we find that
suppressing injury-induced increase in neurogenesis reduces dentate excitability one week after TBI, during
the same period when posttraumatic increase the innate immune receptor, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
augments dentate excitability. TLR4 is known to suppress neurogenesis in naïve animals and paradoxically
increase neurogenesis in stroke. While the molecular mechanisms by which TLR4 regulates excitability and
neurogenesis are unknown, recent findings that TLR4 enhances the endopeptidase, matrix metalloproteinase-
9 (MMP-9), a critical player in synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis provides a promising molecular link
between trauma, TLR4 and aberrant network plasticity. In an integrative approach spanning molecular to
cellular to network function, we propose that early increase in neurogenesis and excitability after TBI disrupt
dentate regulation of cortico-hippocampal throughput and contribute deficits in memory processing by TLR4-
dependent persistent elevation of MMP-9 activity. Using the fluid percussion injury model in mice and current in
vivo and ex vivo electro- and optophysiological techniques, Aim 1 will determine the role of TLR4 signaling in
altered development, maturation and circuit integration of abGCs born after injury. Aim 2 will test if altered DG
excitability and neurogenesis after TBI compromise oscillatory coupling between dentate and hippocampus
which can be prevented by blocking TLR4 early after injury. Finally, Aim 3 will use a combination of
histological, biochemical, physiological, and behavioral assays to test if aberrant TLR4 signaling after TBI
results in persistent increase in MMP-9 which can be targeted to limit aberrant neurogenesis, deficits in
oscillatory coupling and memory deficits after TBI. Such preventive strategies will greatly improve the quality of
life of patients after TBI and address the NINDS mission of decreasing the long-term health care burden posed
by post-traumatic neurological diseases."

Understanding the role of TP53 mutation in genetic susceptibility to ovarian cancer
Women with germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA carriers) are at high risk of developing high-grade
serous ovarian cancer (OC) but little is known about the biological mechanisms that underlie this susceptibility.
BRCA-associated OC is believed to originate from TP53 mutant cells in the fallopian tube, where precursor
lesions synchronous to OC and carrying the same TP53-driver mutation have been identified. However, early
precursor lesions overexpressing TP53 but histologically normal (called p53 foci) have been reported in women
without OC, questioning their significance to carcinogenesis. The goal of this grant is to elucidate the role of
TP53 clonal expansions in BRCA-associated carcinogenesis by using ultra-sensitive sequencing to detect TP53
mutations at a resolution never possible before. Using ultra-sensitive TP53 sequencing, we discovered that most
women, with and without OC, carry TP53 mutations in peritoneal fluid and Pap test DNA, but these mutations
are more abundant in women with OC and in BRCA carriers. We also obtained pilot data that indicates that TP53
mutations are frequent in the fallopian tubes of women without cancer, increasing in abundance and
pathogenicity with age. These results are consistent with recent findings of cancer driver mutations in normal
tissues and the notion of cancer as an evolutionary process that takes place through life. Based on these findings,
we hypothesize that TP53 clonal evolution takes place in the fallopian tubes of women in the general population
but this process is enhanced in women with genetic susceptibility to ovarian cancer. As a result, women at high
risk of OC will carry more pathogenic TP53 mutant clones, which we can detect with unprecedented sensitivity
(>4,000 depth) using CRISPR-DS, a novel ultra-sensitive sequencing method developed by our group. In Aim
1, we will sequence TP53 in fallopian tubes collected at autopsy from 82 women at all decades of life from
newborn to centenarian, pioneering the discovery of the natural history of TP53 mutations in this organ and
providing a baseline control for Aim 2. In Aim 2, we will sequence TP53 in fallopian tubes of 235 women that
underwent prophylactic removal of fallopian tubes and ovaries due to susceptibility to OC, including BRCA
carriers and women with mutations in other OC risk genes or without identified germline mutations. We will
perform a comprehensive characterization of mutation traits (type, location, functional impact, pathogenicity) and
we will compare TP53 mutation frequency and traits with those of women in Aim 1, across groups in Aim 2 and
with standard pathological findings of p53 foci. For the same women, in Aim 3, we will sequence peritoneal fluid,
Pap test, and blood DNA collected at surgery to compare TP53 mutations in those samples with those identified
in fallopian tube. These studies will provide a high-resolution picture of the landscape of TP53 mutation in the
fallopian tube during normal aging and in women with OC susceptibility, improving our understanding of the
pathogenesis of OC and opening new venues for OC prevention and early detection."

Aging is the single greatest cause of disease and death worldwide, and rejuvenating the body by targeting
biological aging processes therefore holds potential to simultaneously prevent multiple chronic diseases like
cancer, heart disease, dementia, and diabetes. While decades of research has unveiled common hallmarks of
aging, like mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and loss of proteostasis, therapies targeting these hallmarks
have elicited only modest rejuvenation in animal models. This may be in part because most aging studies have
focused on only one or a few organs or cell types, with little to no temporal resolution, limiting our ability to
interpret how and when aging impacts these interconnected systems. Recently, however, we have attempted
such a systematic characterization of aging. Using bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA-
sequencing (scRNA-seq) on dozens of mouse organs and cell types across the lifespan (termed Tabula Muris
Senis), we discovered global and specific aging signatures throughout the body. But it remains unknown how,
or if, rejuvenation paradigms affect these global aging pathways, or rather instigate nascent biochemical
programs. The rational design of new therapeutics is therefore challenging.
 One method of rejuvenation which has garnered beneficial effects across organ systems is heterochronic
parabiosis, in which a young and old mouse share a common circulation. Phenotypes like cognition, muscle
strength, and bone repair have all shown functional improvement through exposure to young blood. Parabiosis
research has largely focused on age-related changes to circulating proteins, and several have been determined
to mediate at least some of the observed effects. However, such individual factors have yet to achieve robust
rejuvenation throughout the body, likely in part due to an incomplete understanding of the effects of parabiosis
on disparate organs and cells. Using our newly created Tabula Muris Senis data to represent normal aging, we
investigated scRNA-seq changes in 3 tissues following parabiosis: gonadal and mesenteric adipose tissues,
which undergo age-related gene expression changes prior to other organs, and liver, as hepatocytes were one
of the first cell types observed to benefit from exposure to a young circulatory system. Interestingly, individual
cell types vary greatly in their response to parabiosis, with vascular endothelial cells from all 3 tissues showing
prominent transcriptomic changes consistent with normal aging genes.
 It is our hope that by expanding this analysis to scRNA-seq of 9 tissues, and to bulk RNA-seq of 21
tissues, we can discover signatures that will serve as the basis for identifying small molecules capable of robust
rejuvenation and healthspan extension. As surgically intensive parabiosis is confounded by cell trafficking and
simultaneous exposure to young and aged circulating factors, we further propose to compare parabiosis

sensitive to alterations in plasma factors. Similar to our earlier datasets, all data will be made publically available."

Gliomas represent 80% of the 26,000 newly diagnosed cases of malignant brain and central nervous system
tumors in the United States each year and are among the most lethal and treatment-resistant human cancers.
Although there is a dire need for new ways to combat this disease, the standard treatment for gliomas has not
changed since 2005 and no new glioma medical therapies have been approved in the last decade. In response
to this challenge, we have devised a new way to treat gliomas that have a mutation in a gene called IDH1. IDH1
mutations are present in 70-90% of lower grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas, a highly aggressive
subtype of glioma. We surveyed hundreds of drugs and discovered that a class of drugs that inhibit a particular
metabolic pathway preferentially killed brain tumor cells with IDH1 mutations. Our proposal builds on this
discovery by addressing three Specific Aims. Specific Aim #1 is to understand the molecular mechanisms
through which IDH1 mutations increase sensitivity to inhibitors of this metabolic pathway. We will use cultured
brain tumor cell lines that harbor or lack IDH1 mutations to test our hypothesis that the combined effects of IDH1
mutations and these inhibitors severely impair protein processing and lipid production in tumor cells, creating
stress that ultimately triggers cell death. Specific Aim #2 is to use organoid models derived from human glioma
tissue to assess whether the presence of an IDH1 mutation successfully predicts response to inhibitors of the
metabolic pathway we propose targeting. Organoids represent powerful preclinical disease models because they
allow us to test new therapeutic strategies in a cellular system that accurately reflects the makeup of human
brain tumors. Specific Aim #3 is to use a mouse model of glioma to assess whether inhibiting the metabolic
pathway we've identified to be important for IDH1 mutant brain tumor cells leads to desirable therapeutic
responses, including a block in tumor growth and extension of host survival. These studies will clarify whether
targeting this pathway is likely to provide benefit for human patients with IDH1 mutated brain tumors. Taken
together, our work will outline and test a new treatment strategy for brain tumor patients that could be rapidly
translated to the clinic if our studies are successful. Furthermore, our efforts may demonstrate that IDH1
mutations can be used to faithfully identify individuals whose tumors are poised to respond to the treatment
strategy we are developing, thereby providing a way to design potential future clinical trials that have the greatest
chance to provide benefit for glioma patients."

No woman should die from cervical cancer. We have the technical, medical and policy tools and
approaches to eliminate it. Yet, one woman dies of cervical cancer every two minutes. Cervical cancer is
the third leading malignancy among women in the world, after breast and colorectal cancer. Cervical
cancer is also one of the tumors in which the most glaring disparities exist worldwide. The dramatic
disparity in incidence rates between high- and low-income countries is due primarily to differential
access to effective screening and pre- cancer, or preventive, treatment; similar disparities also exist
within countries. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality has been higher for decades among Latinas in the 
United States (US) [8]. A recent study found that cervical cancer incidence is 32 percent higher among 
Latinas in the 50 states and 78 percent higher in the US territory of Puerto Rico, compared to non-Latina
white women. The screening rates among Latinas is also. The World Health Organization (WHO) 2021
guidelines for treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2-3 and screen-and-treat strategies to
prevent cervical cancer, includes DNA methylation in the screening algorithm. A variety of alternative 
algorithms are being used for cervical cancer screening in low-income populations, which include
oncogenic HPV testing, visual inspection with acetic acid, and self-collected vaginal swabs. HPV testing
is an excellent alternative to cytology for cervical cancer screening. However, HPV tests identifies
women at risk for cervical cancer, but not those HPV-positive women who are most likely to have, or to
develop in the near future, significant disease requiring treatment. Testing DNA biomarkers in self 
collected vaginal swabs can increase cancer screening rates and lead to a reduction in cervical cancer 
disparities among Latinas in the US. In this Fast Track SBIR project, we propose to demonstrate the
feasibility for the commercialization of a precision methylation test in self-collected swabs among Latinas,
using the Precision Cervical Health Promotion program using the CervicalMethDx test, to stratify selfcollected swab of HPV+ patients for high risk of cervical cancer. The CervicalMethDx test will enable
identification of HPV+ women at clinical risk for advancement from low-grade squamous intraepithelial
lesions (LSIL) to Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) in self-collected samples. We are
partnering with Salud Integral en la Montaña, PathAdvantage Clinical laboratory and, David Sidransky’s 
research laboratory to implement the Precision Cervical Health Promotion and optimize CervicalMethDx
Test in self-collected samples, to introduce precision epigenetic services to Latinas in the US and the 
territory of Puerto Rico."

This project will characterize the functions of the human pulvinar (PUL) and mediodorsal (MD) nuclei and their
role in brain-wide networks promoting a variety of high-level cognitive functions and behaviors. We propose to
perform whole-brain fMRI to test the Center hypothesis that PUL and MD play crucial roles in coordinating
information within and across cortical networks. Working closely with P5 (Woodward) and Core C (Chen), Aim
1 will resolve the internal organization of PUL and MD in healthy individuals based on functional connectivity
with cortical networks involved in high-level cognitive functions. We will compare network topologies to those
found in schizophrenia (P5) to identify dysfunction of cortical and thalamic nodes and in their interconnectivity.
In Aim 2, we will adapt the Center’s APU and HDM tasks to assess the PUL and MD’s roles as centralized hubs
for integrating information across cognitive control networks. The use of common tasks with tree shrews and
macaques (P1-3) will allow for bridging across animal models spanning scales of representation from neurons
to circuits to networks. In Aim 3, we will use a variant of the HDM task to identify human-unique characteristics
of thalamocortical cognitive control networks that support flexible rule switching and generalization. We will use
computational cognitive modeling to bridge between neuroimaging and behavior. Resolving the network-level
architecture of PUL-cortical and MD-cortical function during complex cognitive behaviors will provide empirical
and computational insights into the principles guiding behaviorally-relevant thalamocortical function (Center Aim
1), which will serve as a basis for assessing dysfunction (Center Aim 2) and inform the development of a
mechanistic model for human thalamic function (Center Aim 3)."
10813889,"Project Summary / Abstract
Biological membranes are needed by all life forms. These lipid bilayers separate the inside and outside of the
cell and provide the separation between internal compartments. As such, they are the site for cellular
recognition and communication and provide the home to a host of proteins that mediate signaling, catalysis,
the generation and transduction of energy and the import and export of molecules. Despite this central role in
life, membranes and membrane proteins have often been difficult to study using the normal tools of
biochemistry and molecular biology. Membrane proteins display altered activity or are inactive when removed
from their native lipid environment. Likewise, revealing the fundamental molecular recognition events involved
in forming complex multi-component architectures at the membrane surface requires new methodologies.
Nanodiscs, self-assembled nanoscale lipid bilayers solubilized by an amphipathic scaffold protein developed in
our laboratory, have served to enable multiple new discoveries in these arenas. Under continued MIRA support,
we will use the Nanodisc system to provide novel biochemical and biophysical paths to the realization of the
molecular mechanisms involved in signaling, hormone biosynthesis, drug metabolism, the epitaxial
presentation of oligomeric viral antigens and the membrane proteins of the synaptic junction. Systems under
investigation include: The human cytochrome P450 systems involved liver and adrenal metabolism; the Ras
GTPases involved in cancer signaling; vinculin, a critical component in the control of cellular migration, the
proteins of the synaptic junction that bind oligomeric peptides, the ability of Nanodiscs to order complex
oligomeric surface antigens and the biophysics of Nanodisc assembly."
10869929,"Immediate hypersensitivity reactions are dependent on IgE-mediated activation of
basophils and mast cells. There are many elements that regulate expression of the
response that distribute up and down the cascade of events from the generation of IgE
to the tissue end-organ response and the positive and negative feedback loops that link
the various elements together. One of the early necessary elements is related to the
intrinsic ability of the basophil and mast cell to respond to aggregation of the IgE
receptor. It is now apparent that for human basophils, this intrinsic responsiveness
primarily relates the expression of one of the early receptor associated kinases, SYK.
Several studies have established that SYK activity is likely a rate-limiting step in the IgE-
dependent signal transduction cascade and expression levels determine its activity.
Studies have also demonstrated that the very low expression levels of SYK in basophils
are unique to this leukocyte. Recent studies demonstrate 5 regulatory pathways of SYK
expression, two of which have recently been excluded for further consideration as an
explanation for the natural heterogeneity of expression in the population. Based on
preliminary results, the application proposes to examine one of newly described
pathways in greater detail. A large international study established the association of a
SNP family in the SYK gene promoter, in 100% linkage disequilibrium, with SYK
expression is multiple cell types. In a pilot study we found that the same SNP family
strongly associates with the magnitude of IgE-mediated secretion. Aim 1 of the proposal
will expand in both size and detail the pilot study observations. Aim 2 will address a
question raised by the possible association of genotype with function, the reversal of
suppressed SYK expression in patients with omalizumab. Aim 3 will determine which
SNP is relevant to SYK gene expression and examine several hypotheses regarding the
transcription factors that modulate the effect."

Psychotic spectrum disorders (PSD) are disabling severe mental syndromes with high prevalence. Despite
progress in treating the disorders, current medications are not successful in all patients and do not address
cognitive deficits, which are significant in predicting functional outcome. Thus, new treatment targets are
essential in moving the field forward.
Deficits in iron metabolism have been proposed as a potential mechanism, supported by findings of higher
incidence of PSD in individuals affected by iron deficiency at different developmental stages, from prenatal life
and infancy to adulthood. However, assessments of the iron content at brain level remain extremely rare,
which represents a critical gap in the current understanding of the disorders, particularly in light of recent
literature highlighting the role of iron in the development of the dopaminergic system during adolescence and
young adulthood, a critical developmental period for the emergence of PSD.
In this application, we propose to address this gap in literature by conducting a multi-parametric MRI study
to test whether iron content of several subcortical structures is decreased in PSD. We will also test whether
decreased brain iron associates with increased symptoms and decreased cognitive ability. Assessing iron
content at brain level is essential since brain tissue iron may be depleted before anemia is detected, and thus,
deficits may not be reflected by typical assessments of iron in blood.
Confirmation of brain iron deficits in PSD should promote further studies focused on better understanding of
how brain iron homeostasis is affected in PSD and how iron deficits impact related systems and processes
known to be affected in these disorders. If successful, the study may ultimately lead to treatment strategies that
may contribute to amelioration of PSD symptoms and may provide means to asses the efficacy of such
treatments."
10841495,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Precisely regulated gene expression is essential for photoreceptor development and maintenance. This process
is governed by a genetic program centered on the cone-rod homeobox transcription factor CRX. Mutations in
the human CRX gene have been associated with dominant retinopathies with a wide-range of phenotypes and
ages of onset. A poor understanding of the mechanism of each individual mutation has made it difficult to develop
treatment strategies. To address these challenges, our lab has defined four classes of disease-causing CRX
mutations and made mouse models carrying a representative mutation(s) of each class. Up to now, we and
others have characterized and reported findings on mouse models for three such classes, proving concordance
between the mouse and human conditions due to each mutation. These studies have already provided a deep
knowledge of disease pathogenesis. However, the pathogenic mechanism of mutations in the remaining class
(Class II) remains to be determined. Class II mutations are linked to the early-onset dominant retinopathies Leber
congenital amaurosis (adLCA) and cone rod dystrophy (adCoRD). We have generated mouse lines carrying two
individual Class II mutations, Crx-K88N and Crx-E80A, and find that each develops a dominant LCA or CoRD-
like phenotype associated with misregulation of photoreceptor gene expression. Because these mutations are
located in the CRX homeodomain responsible for DNA binding, we hypothesize that the disease proteins
misregulate gene expression by altering CRX’s DNA binding specificity, leading to CRX malfunction at target
sites. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will test our hypothesis in both cell culture and mouse models using cell
biology, molecular and functional genomics approaches. Using unbiased high-throughput DNA binding and
regulatory function assays, we will determine how these mutations alter CRX’s regulatory activity, leading to
misregulation of gene expression and functional deficits in photoreceptors. In Aim 2, we will address the lack of
treatment strategies for CRX diseases. We hypothesize that exogenous introduction of the proper amount of
normal CRX during a therapeutic window can improve the photoreceptor phenotype in diseased retinae. We
have designed a tunable gene augmentation approach that incorporates a tetracycline (doxycycline) switch to
turn-on or turn-off therapeutic CRX produced by a transgene integrated within the genome or carried by an adeno
associated virus (AAV). We will evaluate phenotypic improvement using established multidisciplinary
approaches and expect to see varying degrees of phenotype rescue in different mouse models by CRX
augmentation. The outcome of this research will advance our understanding of CRX disease and photoreceptor
development, and inform future efforts to treat patients with CRX disease."
10817866,"Project Summary/Abstract
During pregnancy and delivery women experience pelvic soft tissue injury. This injury is associated with the
development of symptomatic pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) including pelvic organ prolapse, urinary, and fecal
incontinence. One of the biggest barriers to preventing birth injury and the subsequent sequelae of PFDs is our
lack of understanding of when and how injury occurs. Simulation models suggest that term delivery requires
stretch to the maternal pelvic floor musculature to a degree greater than that which skeletal muscle can normally
undergo without sustaining injury. Thus, with term vaginal birth, near universal injury would be expected.
Previous studies have used anatomic and functional methodology to explore this neuromuscular injury, but we
continue to lack a complete understanding of maternal pelvic floor injury and recovery patterns. We also possess
limited knowledge of the changes which maternal soft tissues undergo during pregnancy, presumably to facilitate
atraumatic birth. Our institution houses the SQUID Array for Reproductive Assessment (SARA) system, a novel
and noninvasive tool to assess biomagnetic signals such as those created by depolarization occurring with
muscle contraction. We propose to adapt SARA system to record the biomagnetic signals generated by the
levator ani muscles (LAMs) of the maternal pelvic floor and apply advanced signal processing techniques to
extract and characterize the LAM electrophysiology. These magnetomyographic (MMG) recordings will be used
to study maternal pelvic floor neuromuscular function before and after delivery. Our project will be the first to
comprehensively use MMG technology to assess the maternal LAMs. We will combine clinical, anatomic, and
physiologic endpoints to improve our knowledge of maternal pelvic muscular adaptations and injury recovery
patterns using a comprehensive protocol with which we have demonstrated promising preliminary data in small
cohorts of nulligravidas and nulliparous gravidas. This proposal is in response to NIBIB’s PAR-19-158
Bioengineering Research Grants, where we apply a multidisciplinary integrative team approach to address
the paucity of knowledge regarding maternal muscular adaptations and maternal LAM injury thus provide a
framework for future innovation in injury prevention and recovery research. Our overall hypothesis is that MMG
will allow detection of maternal LAMs adaptation during pregnancy and identification of injury and recovery
patterns postpartum. Aim 1: To adapt biomagnetic technology based system to record high spatial temporal
MMG LAM complex and apply advanced signal processing methods to extract relevant pelvic floor muscle
parameters. Aim 2: To track and characterize changes in levator MMG signals with parturition comparing 3rd
trimester pregnancy to early and late postpartum. Aim 3: To correlate MMG patterns of LAM birth injury and
recovery and associate MMG evidence of injury with PFD symtpoms and injury visible by transperineal US."

Mechanics of Cells & Tissues impact Chromosome Instability & Phagocytic Interactions
Tumors evolve genetically via selection from a diverse population of cells with high levels of genetic variation. A
common cause is chromosome instability (CIN) due to impaired mitotic segregation. Paradoxically, mitotic errors
do not typically associate with mutations in genes involved in the core processes of mitosis. Our overall
hypothesis is that extrinsic mechanical factors – particularly 3D tissue/tumor architecture and its rigidity –
contribute to CIN and to the immune-sculpted evolution of aneuploidy. Conventional 2D cultures of cancer cells
are limited in elucidating roles for most tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. Our in vitro and in vivo studies
will therefore collaboratively extend to 3D some of the key DNA damage/mitotic and immune signaling studies
of project 1 (Greenberg) as well as the myeloid-centric effects on tumors of project 3 (Shin/Haldar). Central
components of our studies also make use of two unique cores (Black, Chenoweth).
 Disrupted tissue architecture, which is common in epithelial cancers, and loss of adhesion lead to mitotic
errors, but how these extracellular signals couple to internal mitotic processes is unclear. We propose that the
external and internal mechanics are linked as tension propagates from extracellular matrices to the cortex to the
mitotic spindle and ultimately to kinetochores. We will test the hypothesis that adhesion tightens the mechanical
coupling by manipulating either extracellular or kinetochore-microtubule tension, using mammalian artificial
chromosomes (MACs, with Black) and chemical optogenetic tools (with Chenoweth). We will also test whether
loss of tissue architecture and integrin function creates a vulnerability as cells are more dependent on other
pathways for maintaining tension, such as cortical rounding or microtubule crosslinking within the spindle.
Genome instability outputs including cytoplasmic RNA accumulation will be primary measures, extending to
signaling pathways (with Greenberg) via innate immunity.
 Solid tumors are filled with macrophages that respond to numerous signals from nearby tumor cells, but
coupled effects of the confining and constricting rigidity of solid tumors are unknown. We will modulate and
visualize phagocytic interactions via ‘macrophage checkpoint’ disruption (CD47 on the cancer cell; SIRPa on the
macrophage) to test the hypothesis that this basic macrophage interaction (already in clinical trials) modulates
and is modulated by cancer genome variation. Single cell analyses will assess immune subtypes and signaling
interactions, which we will perturb (with Shin/Haldar). We will study the processes primarily in
immunocompetent, syngeneic B16 mouse melanoma model but also in an ovarian cancer model (with
Greenberg). We seek to determine whether 3D tumor tissue rigidity increases a tumor’s genetic variation,
particularly via CIN-initiated signaling, such as by micronuclei (with Greenberg). We will also determine coupled
effects of macrophage checkpoint disruption (including antagonist peptides from Chenowith), based on
preliminary data that already demonstrates durable cures with production of anti-tumor IgG."

Impaired DNA damage responses can lead to genomic and chromosomal instability in cancer. High levels of
chromosomal instability have been associated with increased mutation rates, metastasis, and immune evasion
in cancer. Paradoxically however, DNA- damaging chemo- and radio-therapies can trigger anti-tumor
inflammatory responses. How DNA damage in tumor cells regulate both anti-and pro-tumor immune responses
within the tumor microenvironment (TME) represents an important knowledge gap. The Greenberg group
(Project 1) has shown that DNA damage in cancer cells activate cytosolic DNA sensing pathway regulated by
cyclic AMP-GMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING), as well as an RNA sensing
pathway regulated by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). Activation of these nucleic acid-sensing pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs) induces type I interferon (IFN-I) – a cytokine that promotes protective immunity
against pathogens. Cytosolic nucleic acids can also activate inflammasomes to secrete interleukin (IL)-1β and -
18, which have both pro- and anti-tumor effects. Intriguingly, our preliminary data suggest that inflammasome
activation in response to DNA damage promotes tumor growth in an ovarian cancer model. Antigen presenting
cells (APCs) are key mediators of immune responses and our recent work have identified novel subsets of APCs
and their regulation by interferons in the TME. In this proposal, we will examine the hypothesis that the outcome
of tumor control is driven by the opposing anti- and pro-tumor effects of IFN-I and IL-1β/ IL-18 on APCs in
response to cancer cell DNA damage. Towards this goal, we will closely collaborate with Projects 1 (Greenberg)
and 2 (Lampson/Discher) and rely on novel genetic (MAC core) and chemical (Chemical Biology Core) tools.
The three specific aims will examine the mechanisms underlying IFN-I-dependent anti-tumor (Aim 1) and
inflammasome dependent pro-tumor (Aim 2) effects of cancer cell DNA damage, and provide proof-of-concept
for targeting these pathways for combinatorial immunotherapy (Aim 3). These findings will provide fundamental
insights into immune mechanisms underlying how genome instability regulates immune responses in tumor and
provide a foundation for future attempts to target these pathways for cancer therapy."

(UVM) as a sustainable center of research excellence. This multidisciplinary center investigates relationships
between personal behavior (lifestyle) and risk for chronic disease and premature death. VCBH made
considerable progress during Phases 1 and 2 towards becoming a vibrant and sustainable center. VCBH
established a strong record of external grant support and peer-reviewed publications with $165.1 million in total
cumulative funding, including $18.3 million from awards to COBRE Project Leaders (PLs), and 917 articles in
peer-reviewed journals, including 515 listing PLs as 1st or co-authors. PLs succeeded in obtaining NIH,
foundation, and industry awards as PIs, Project PIs, and Co-Is. Other Phase 1 and 2 notable accomplishments
included establishing an NIH-supported UVM Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science with an initial P50 award
that was renewed as a U54, twice renewing an NIH T32 training award in clinical addictions research now in
years 31-36, and establishing the new HRSA-supported UVM Center on Rural Addiction and a new NIH T32
training award in neurobiological addiction research. VCBH cores continue to support a vibrant monthly lecture
series, annual national conferences, and guest editorship of an annual special issue of the peer-reviewed journal
Preventive Medicine based on the conferences. VCBH collaborations with other COBREs continue to grow, with
VCBH PI Dr. Higgins chairing two COBRE External Advisory Committees and serving as a member of a third. In
Phase 3, we propose to sustain VCBH competitiveness in obtaining external grant support and fostering new

Unhealthy choices to smoke, consume alcohol in excess, overeat, and lead sedentary lifestyles underlie a
preponderance of chronic disease in the U.S. Greater understanding of the mechanisms underpinning
vulnerability to such unhealthy behavior and developing more effective behavior-change interventions is vitally
important to improving U.S. public health. The overarching goal of the Administrative Core of the Vermont Center
on Behavior and Health (VCBH) is to coalesce existing strengths and seed new research directions at the
University of Vermont (UVM) while continuing to engage in local, national, and international collaborations.
During Phases 1 and 2, this core has established the administrative and intellectual infrastructure necessary to
(a) strengthen and grow collaboration among a critical mass of talented investigators who share scientific
expertise in this area, (b) effectively mentor early-career faculty in conducting thematically related research and
(c) coalesce the productive collaborations necessary to compete effectively in obtaining external grant support
at levels that can sustain the VCBH beyond COBRE support. We propose that Stephen T. Higgins, PhD, continue
as Director of this core with Philip A. Ades, MD, as Associate Director. Accomplished UVM independent
investigators will continue directing cores on behavioral economics and intervention sciences (Stacey C. Sigmon,
PhD), and collaboration, dissemination, and education (Diann E. Gaalema, PhD, & Richard A. Rawson, PhD). A
Pilot Project Program led by Dr. Higgins and Elias M. Klemperer, PhD, will be leveraged to support and mentor
early-career faculty and generate preliminary data for collaborative NIH center grants and program projects as
well as more focused applications in the R series. We will continue collaborating with community healthcare
leaders and investigators from other IDeA States and beyond in pursuing the VCBH mission to grow collaborative
research and impact state and federal public health policy. Program oversight will be guided by an External
Advisory Committee of distinguished scientific leaders in behavior and health. An Internal Advisory Committee
composed of accomplished multidisciplinary senior UVM investigators will provide guidance on scientific and
organizational matters. A Community Advisory Committee of Vermont experts in healthcare delivery and policy
will assure that VCBH remains apprised of local healthcare challenges. This multidisciplinary team will work
closely together to firmly establish VCBH as a sustainable center of research excellence with local, national, and
international reach."

Program (CMMTP) is to provide a diverse pool of graduate students with rigorous training in biomedical
research with special emphasis in team science. Support is requested for three/six students, to be supported
by the T32 for a two-year period. The program emphasizes team interdisciplinary research training and
provides extensive hands-on experience in challenging research projects focused on comparative molecular
medicine, and extensive professional development designed to prepare trainees for a successful career in
the biomedical sciences. To achieve our objectives, we have incorporated a set of novel components
including: 1) Two Team Science courses, the first led by an Associate Professor with a PhD degree in
Communications, focused on developing the communication skills required to successfully participate in
team-based collaborative interdisciplinary research, and the second led by the Senior Associate Director for
Operations and Academic Programs, Shelton Leadership Center, focused on team leadership skills related
to biomedical sciences. 2) A team science mentoring program, the Young Scholar Program (YSP), which
provides an opportunity for CMMTP trainees to apply and further refine competencies in project management,
mentoring, and effective group communication, including teaching in an undergraduate course in Team
Sciences in the Biomedical Sciences. 3) The requirement for the development of a collaborative aim (a co-
aim) in the trainee’s thesis proposal. 4) A graduate level minor in “Team Leadership and Communication in
the Biomedical Sciences"". A minor that will help prepare the future leaders in interdisciplinary biomedical
research. 5) Close incorporation of science of education expertise within the proposal not only to assess the
program, but more importantly, to develop new educational approaches to train PhD students to carry out
complex interdisciplinary research in the biomedical sciences. This includes an education/communication
PhD student as part of the institutional commitment. This PhD student will use the CMMTP program as the
basis for their research on improving education methods in team science. They will ensure that each of our
training activities is assessed using evidence-based approaches and that this information is used to further
improve methods for team interdisciplinary research training. Other components include: 1) Basing the
training grant in the Comparative Medicine Institute (CMI). The CMI’s well established cross-departmental
organizational infrastructure facilitates the management and implementation of this training grant, and 2)

The Molecular and Cellular Basis of Infectious Diseases (MCBID) program is uniquely situated in the Molecular
Microbiology and Immunology (MMI) Department within the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
and thus provides our trainees with didactic and research training in the context of public health problems, such
as the COVID-19 pandemic. MCBID will select 8 PhD students and 4 postdoctoral fellows from a large pool of
highly qualified applicants to support for 1-2 years. The MCBID training program rose to the challenge of the
epidemic by rapidly re-focusing research projects to support convalescent plasma efforts and explore
fundamental questions of SARS-CoV-2 and its immune response. The 37 training faculty have a wide range of
experience and expertise in viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites causing human disease and in the invertebrate
vectors associated with emergence and transmission of these pathogens. Since first funded in 1994, the MCBID
program has produced scientists working in many areas of academia, industry and government on problems
related to infectious diseases, vaccine development and the public's health. The primary source of training is in
the research laboratory with personalized mentoring. The goal of the MCBID training program is to provide
trainees with both a firm foundation in the basic disciplines necessary for the study of infectious diseases and a
perspective that will enable them to apply their knowledge creatively to public health problems. Each PhD
student completes: 1) a series of required courses in the basic disciplines of cell and molecular biology,

postdoctoral training program are: 1) to provide focused training in those areas of the molecular and cellular
basis of infectious diseases in which program faculty have special expertise; 2) to provide an opportunity for
doctoral degree holders trained in more traditional environments to broaden their exposure to problems of
public health importance and to evaluate their career goals in terms of public health issues; and 3) to prepare
postdoctoral fellows for an independent career in the biological sciences."

Metabolic Benefits of Leptin Reduction
Adipocytes have moved to center stage with respect to systemic metabolic control. They regulate metabolic
homeostasis for a variety of tissues. Adipocytes achieve this regulation on the basis of their unsurpassed
ability to store and neutralize excess lipids. Importantly, they interact with other critical organs through the use
of adipokines. Leptin and adiponectin are the two most prominent factors that have been widely studied. The
availability of floxed versions of both genes encoding these factors has offered us the opportunity to eliminate
both adipokines in the adult stage to varying degrees. Reducing leptin levels in adult obese animals has
yielded a number of surprising findings. We recently published these findings in Cell Metabolism, in which we
showed that a reduction in systemic leptin levels results in enhanced leptin and insulin sensitivity. In contrast,
elevating leptin levels in a transgenic manner, by as little as 50%, results in further leptin and insulin
resistance. Here, we aim to better define the mechanistic aspects of this phenomenon. This includes: a)
determining which anti-diabetic regimens rely on leptin-lowering effects to achieve their established actions; b)
elucidating the signaling mechanisms underlying leptin sensitization upon reducing the ligand concentrations;
c) gaining a firm understanding on the control of leptin production at the level of different fat-pads. Our
proposed experiments should provide significant new insights into leptin production and leptin action. We can
address these questions with a series of new and unique mouse models that we recently generated.
Specifically, we aim to: I) Determine the effects of acute and chronic leptin reduction on peripheral leptin and
insulin sensitivity. We will manipulate leptin receptor levels and downstream signaling mediators, obtain in vivo
signaling information for both leptin and insulin signaling in real time, address sexually dimorphic responses to
leptin reduction and investigate the impact of adiponectin on leptin expression. II) We will examine whether
anti-diabetic interventions rely on leptin lowering prior to weight loss. Here, we will focus on a number of
different established pharmacological agents for which we will “clamp” leptin levels transgenically at baseline
levels during treatment, or further reduce leptin levels with neutralizing anti-leptin antibodies to enhance the
effects of these agents. III) We will assess whether the improvements in central leptin action that we
established by lowering leptin levels, require central leptin receptor action to achieve improved read-outs. If so,
which subpopulation of neurons is critically involved in this process? IV) Determine the critical mediators that
govern leptin production and release, particularly in the visceral adipocyte. We will examine whether 3 and 2a
adrenergic receptors regulate leptin levels in the mature adipocyte. The Scherer/Elmquist team, with their
respective expertise in adipose tissue and the hypothalamus, is strategically extremely well positioned to
address these questions. Importantly, we will gain new insights that may have a profound effect on our
understanding of leptin physiology specifically and metabolic homeostasis in general."
10843864,"Unilateral amputation, nerve damage or stroke cause widespread and robust changes in neural activity revealed in
patient imaging studies. Successful rehabilitation of affected limbs after stroke, spared senses or intact limbs after nerve
injury, or incorporation of prosthetics in an amputee’s daily life relies on the brain’s ability to adapt to these changes. On
the other hand, chronic pain conditions such as phantom limb pain, hyperalgesia or complex regional pain syndrome are
also proposed to be a result of cortical rewiring following some of these perturbations. The mechanisms underlying these
phenotypes are unknown.
 We have developed an animal model which displays remarkably similar neural activity phenotypes during
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I have characterized the synaptic basis of the interhemispheric plasticity
that is thought to underlie either adaptive or maladaptive plasticity in patients. The goal of the K99/R00 project is to
characterize the specific neurons and synapses in the cortical circuit and determine if the changes we observe have a
functional output to mediate more widespread changes in the brain. The functional relevance of these changes in
connectivity will help determine if the plasticity we observe is adaptive, maladaptive or both. During the K99 training
phase I will use a combination of fMRI, slice electrophysiology, viral tracing, and single nucleus RNA sequencing to
identify key players that mediate these changes in neural activity. These results will guide experiments in the R00 phase,
where I will modulate these cells with targeted interventions to re-calibrate the system. I will also use behavior to
determine if the interventions are functionally relevant in vivo.
 The identification of specific subsets of neurons and their functional output will enable characterization of cortical
rewiring after peripheral nerve injury. I will determine which neurons may be underlying adaptive or maladaptive
plasticity. By targeting these neurons for therapeutic purposes, I will enhance adaptive plasticity to mediate better
recovery or reduce pain conditions caused by maladaptive plasticity. These interventions may be clinically beneficial, but
in order to be most effective complete characterization of the circuit underlying these changes is required."

Genome-wide association studies have identified many Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk genes related to immune
response. Among these are the microglial receptors CD33 and TREM2. We previously showed that knock-out
of CD33 attenuated amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology and improved cognition in 5XFAD mice, both of which were
abrogated by additional Trem2 knock-out. Knocking out Trem2 in 5XFAD mice exacerbated Aβ pathology and
neurodegeneration but reduced microglia numbers. RNA-seq profiling of microglia revealed that genes related
to phagocytosis and signaling (IL-6, IL-8, acute phase response) are downregulated in 5XFAD;Trem2-/- mice.
Differential gene expression in 5XFAD;CD33-/- microglia depended on the presence of Trem2, suggesting
TREM2 acts downstream of CD33. Moreover, we reported that the D87N and T96K variants of TREM2
increased AD risk in the NIMH family-based genetic data and ADSP case-control samples and showed that
these variants increased binding to TREM2 ligands. In our preliminary study, we found that the gain-of-function
Trem2T96K variant increased levels of insoluble Aβ42 but reduced both microglia numbers and clustering of
microglia around Aβ plaques in 5XFAD mice. Furthermore, the Trem2T96K variant reduced secretion of sTrem2
in 5XFAD mice. Finally, the T96K variant led to reduced cell surface expression and secretion of TREM2 in
human microglial cell lines. Here, we propose to 1) assess the impact of TREM2 gain-of-function mutations on
AD pathogenesis, 2) investigate the effects of these mutations on microglial activation and gene expression,
and 3) identify and characterize novel AD-associated TREM2 gain-of-function mutations as well as target
TREM2 for therapeutic purposes. In Aim 1, we will examine the effects of the gain-of-function Trem2T96K
mutation on Aβ pathology, neurodegeneration and plaque associated-neuritic dystrophy in 5XFAD mice. We
will also determine whether Trem2T96K impacts cognitive function in 5XFAD mice. In Aim 2, we will investigate
the impact of the gain-of-function Trem2T96K mutation on microglial cell activation and recruitment to Aβ
plaques as well as immune response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation in 5XFAD mice. RNA-seq profiling of
microglia will reveal the effects of Trem2T96K on microglial gene expression signature and how they compare to
disease-associated microglia. In Aim 3, we will analyze whole genome sequencing data from the NIMH family
sample and NIA ADSP to identify novel AD-associated TREM2 mutations that will be characterized for their
effects on ligand-dependent activation of TREM2. We will then introduce novel TREM2 gain-of-function
mutations into iPSC-derived human microglia-like cells using CRISPR/Cas9 system and investigate underlying
molecular mechanisms. Finally, we will predict and validate novel targeted drugs that mimic TREM2 activation
and/or oppose TREM2 loss-of-function using computational approaches. The major goals of this proposal are
to comprehensively assess the effects of TREM2 gain-of-function mutations on AD pathogenesis and explore
underlying molecular networks, which will facilitate AD therapeutics targeting TREM2."

It is well known that the pathogenesis of HIV is intricately linked to the immune system. For HIV to promote its
replication and long-term infection HIV must also modulate cytokine signaling to manipulate the immune
microenvironment HIV is existing in. In our previous work we have found that HIV has encoded accessory
genes that are able to block the action of the important innate antiviral cytokine named Type I Interferon. Type
I Interferons were named for their ability to interfere with the replication of viruses and HIV has encoded
multiple ways to block this cytokine. The overall goal of this R03 application is to determine how one of the
HIV-encoded genes that blocks Type I Interferon can block this signaling in T cells, the major cell infected by
HIV. Long term, this work is critical to set the stage to better understand how HIV sustains itself in a person
and avoids elimination by the innate immune system."

The overall goal of NIGMS-funded research in my lab is to define the molecular and cellular
mechanisms that control cell size and shape. Defects in cell size and shape are associated with
human diseases including cancer, so defining the underlying mechanisms can identify future
therapeutic targets. We use the fission yeast S. pombe as a model system to study these
fundamental processes. These rod-shaped eukaryotic cells grow by linear extension due to
polarized secretion at growing cell tips, and enter mitosis at a highly reproducible size due to
regulated activation of the ubiquitous cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1. Decades of genetic screens
have identified an extensive “parts list” for regulation of cell size and shape. Our current challenge
is to assemble these parts into defined signaling networks that spatially control cell growth and
activate Cdk1 in a size-dependent manner. For this work, we take a multidisciplinary approach
that combines genetics, quantitative live-cell microscopy, phosphoproteomics, and biochemical
reconstitution.
In this proposal, we will address four key unanswered questions. First, how do cortical multiprotein
clusters called “nodes” control fission yeast cell size at division? We discovered that nodes
contain conserved cell cycle regulators including the protein kinases Cdr2, Cdr1, and Wee1, but
we do not know the mechanisms of assembly or signal transduction within nodes. Second, what
is the role of multiple cell cycle pathways in monitoring aspects of cell size such as volume and
surface area? We will focus on the mitotic inducers Cdc25 and Cdc13/cyclin, with the goal of
generating systems-level knowledge supported by mathematical modeling. Third, how do cell
polarity mechanisms that function far away from the growing cell tips contribute to cell shape? We
will exploit our recent discoveries that implicate RNA granules and SNARE protein clusters as
novel “at-a-distance” regulators of cell polarity and shape. Fourth, how do cell size and shape
influence spatial patterning of nodes in cells? We have identified cell tips, cortical anchors, and
the nucleus as critical regulators of node positioning. We will combine genetic mutants with
quantitative fluorescence microscopy and particle-based simulations to define the underlying
design principles of this system. Based on extensive conservation of these pathways and
processes between yeast and mammals, we fully expect that discoveries from our work will impact
and guide future work in other organisms and biological systems."

Resolution in skin wound healing is coordinated by intercellular communication processes that
include extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing biologically active protein and nucleic acid. In injury
models, EVs have been shown to be important mediators of tissue repair, although the
mechanisms underlying the formation of specific EV subsets, loading of EV payloads, and cell-
type specific EV uptake remain poorly understood. We address this knowledge gap with a
comprehensive genetic approach to modify the regulation of EV biogenesis to change the EV
Profile, Payload and Activity in cutaneous wound models that have well-defined biological
relevance. We have recently established that genetic tools regulating EV biogenesis `re-program'
EV payload. Moreover, over-expression of specific pro-reparative payloads that were identified
by mass spectrometry can be engineered and delivered to promote resolution in models of
impaired wound healing. With a focus on the discovery of novel EV mediators of crosstalk
between immune and epithelial cells in the wound bed, we have focused on the biology of EVs in
mediating intercellular signaling in EVs formation (Project 1-EV Biogenesis), the engineering of
biologically active payloads (Project 2-EV Payloads), and identifying specific cell types that
internalize EVs in the wound bed (Project 3-EV Uptake). Together, these Projects address the
over-arching goals of creating therapeutic EVs with a systematic approach that is optimized for
specific cell types based on an understanding of 1) How and where EVs are made?; 2) How EVs
are loaded and whether they are biologically active ?; and 3) Which cells uptake EVs to promote
durable tissue repair."

The goal of this project is to identify mechanisms by which immune checkpoint programmed death
ligand 1 (PD-L1) regulates mRNA homeostasis of anti-apoptotic genes. As a cell surface protein,
PD-L1 inhibits T cell responses, resulting in immune escape. However, PD-L1 also has important
non-immune intracellular functions that are much less understood. Our recent studies show that IFNγ
induces the nuclear translocation and accumulation of PD-L1 in ovarian and prostate cancer cells.
In addition, our preliminary data indicate that suppression of the IFNγ-induced PD-L1 expression
increases apoptosis and decreases mRNA levels of NFκB-dependent anti-apoptotic genes. Based
on those findings, we will test the central hypothesis that the intracellular PD-L1 serves as a
regulator of anti-apoptotic gene mRNA homeostasis. In Aim 1, we will determine whether PD-L1
increases the levels of anti-apoptotic genes by promoting their transcription, and/or whether it
increases stability of their mRNAs in ovarian and prostate cancer cells. In Aim 2, we will determine
whether PD-L1 directly binds to the anti-apoptotic gene promoters and facilitates their acetylation,
and we will investigate whether PD-L1 binds the anti-apoptotic mRNAs and affects their subcellular
localization. Although the project focuses on the NFκB-dependent anti-apoptotic genes, the results
will likely reveal general mechanisms by which PD-L1 regulates synthesis and/or stability of other
mRNAs. Immunotherapies targeting cell surface PD-L1 have shown impressive clinical outcomes in
many cancers; however, only a fraction of patients achieves durable responses, highlighting our
incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of PD-L1 functions. Findings from this study will
provide the first data on the mechanisms of how PD-L1 regulates mRNA homeostasis of anti-
apoptotic genes. This information will advance our understanding of the intracellular, immune-
independent functions of PD-L1, and may lead to the development of novel therapies that target PD-
L1 anti-apoptotic functions in cancer cells. In addition, this R16 SuRE project will enhance the
research environment at St. John’s University by providing students from underrepresented
backgrounds with numerous opportunities to learn the fundamentals of biomedical research."

Neuropsychiatric disorders are a leading cause of disability worldwide, with depressive disorders being the most
disabling among them. Many patients are resistant to all current treatments. Invasive electrical brain stimulation
for treatment-resistant depression showed early promise in open-label studies but has had variable efficacy in
controlled clinical trials. To date, stimulation in neuropsychiatric disorders has been limited to an open-loop
approach that applies a fixed pattern of continuous stimulation regardless of symptom levels. One limitation is
that open-loop stimulation does not track the inter- and intra-subject variabilities in neuropsychiatric symptoms,
which can change rapidly in an individual. Another limitation is the lack of an input-output model that can guide
stimulation by predicting how ongoing stimulation input drives large-scale neural activity and the symptoms it
underlies in an individual. We will address these limitations to enable precise invasive electrical brain stimulation
for neuropsychiatric disorders by developing a novel real-time model-based neural control system. We will
provide proof-of-concept demonstration for acute control of neural biomarkers of mood states related to
depression symptoms in epilepsy patients with implanted intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) electrodes,
in whom we will obtain repeated mood self-reports and perform stimulation simultaneously with neural recording.
The system will continuously adjust the stimulation parameters, for the first time, based on 2 elements: (i) Novel
personalized input-output model learned on recorded brain network response while delivering a new stochastic
stimulation waveform to excite network activity. (ii) Personalized decoder trained on multi-day continuous iEEG
recordings and simultaneous mood self-reports to estimate mood state variations from neural activity as
feedback. Combining these, we will build a real-time model-based closed-loop system to precisely drive the
neurally-decoded mood state—the neural biomarker of mood—to a target level. Our system generalizes to any
stimulation site. Here, we will demonstrate the system with orbitofrontal stimulation as we have shown it to
acutely improve mood and modulate large-scale mood-relevant brain activity. We will run real-time closed-loop
experiments in each patient. The system will estimate the neural biomarker from iEEG and adjust the stimulation
amplitude and frequency in real-time based on the input-output model to drive the estimated biomarker to a
target level. We will also develop model-free closed-loop on-off stimulation that turns stimulation on-off based
on the neural biomarker. We will compare model-based, on-off and open-loop stimulations. Success of this
program will enable precisely regulating a desired brain state by developing the first model-based closed-
loop invasive brain stimulation system and advancing neuromodulation technology. It will also directly
inform electrical stimulation therapy in future pivotal clinical trials of refractory depression. The developed system
and gained knowledge will generalize across many neuropsychiatric disorders with broad public health impact."

At last count, sepsis was reported to be the leading cause of death in U.S hospital intensive care units (ICU);
accounting for ~1 in 5 deaths world-wide; its incidence is anticipated to rise as the populations in developed
countries age; and it was the consensus cause of death assigned to those dying from COVID-19 infection. Most
frustrating, is that while we continue to optimize the supportive care for these critically ill patients, we have yet to
see a novel molecular etiology-based therapy make a sustained impact on overall septic morbidity/ mortality.
Excitingly, while working for years on defining numerous defects of components of both adaptive and innate
immune responsiveness induced by shock and/or sepsis, we have uncovered novel role(s) for a number of the
B7-family of cell-associated co-inhibitory receptors, Programmed Cell Death Receptor-1 [PD-1], B-/T-
Lymphocyte Attenuator [BTLA], recently, V-domain Immunoglobulin Suppressor of T cell Activation [VISTA,
a.k.a., B7-H5, PD-1H] and their respective cell surface ligands; popularly referred to as checkpoint proteins. In
this competitive renewal of our MIRA program, we propose to continue to push forward the 3 project areas we
brought together previously under the over-arching concept that by understanding the mechanism(s) of
injury/shock and/or sepsis that serve to predispose animals (experimentally) or critically ill/injured
patients to develop morbid outcomes, we can elucidate not only novel prognostic markers of patient’s
course, but uncover unique therapeutic targets for their treatment. In the 1st Project area we will determine
how the select expression of PD-1, BTLA or VISTA, on myeloid as opposed to lymphoid cells alters the
development of morbid events associated with sepsis; then, how the expression of ligands for these co-inhibitory
molecules, on leukocytes and/or endothelial/epithelial cells, contribute to the onset of septic liver, intestine and/or
kidney dysfunction. In our 2nd Project area, we will utilize a novel murine model of indirect-acute lung injury
(iALI)(dual insults of hemorrhage shock followed by cecal ligation & puncture [CLP]) to ask how checkpoint
protein expression not only effect the patho-mechanisms driving the development of iALI, but how are these co-
inhibitors alter cell ‘priming’/’innate immune memory’/function by following pulmonary immune/non-immune cell
transcriptomic/epigenomic fate/programing. Finally, (3rd Project) since the neonate possesses a unique/naïve
immune system and is more susceptible to morbid response in the face of infectious challenge; we ask how the
expression of members of the B-7 family of proteins and/or their ligands not only have a comparative impact on
the response to septic insult, but how this alters their microbiota and epigenetic makeup/immune function as
survivors mature? To do this we will interrogate these 3 cogent models of sepsis, shock/sepsis and/or neonatal
sepsis, by applying a combination genetic/Cre-Lox mouse models, adoptive transfer, single cell RNA-seq/ATAC-
seq, 16S microbiota RNA-seq and bisulfite/pyrosequencing to examine these questions/hypotheses along with
select observational clinical studies in the critical ill patient population."

10851762,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sex-bias exists in the human genome in DNA content and gene expression. The human X and Y
chromosomes are useful tools for inferring human demography, and crucial for our understanding of human
health. However, despite the genomics era, X and Y chromosomes are still vastly underutilized, especially in a
genome-wide context. Most established genomics methods and analyses fail to explicitly incorporate sex
chromosomes, missing more than 5% of typical genomic variation, and ignoring regions known to contribute to
disease. The study of sex chromosome evolution therefore addresses deficits in conventional approaches with
critical implications for human health and biology. My research has focused on the integration of these
chromosomes to build comprehensive analyses of human history and utilizing an evolutionary approach to
characterize sex-bias in gene expression. This project will utilize multiple approaches for studying sex
chromosome variation across human and non-human species. First, we will focus on development and
extensive testing of novel methodology for accurately accounting for technical variation that affects alignment
and variant calling on the sex chromosomes. Current alignment pipelines do not account for the shared
homology between the X and Y chromosome, resulting in mis-mapping of reads between the sex
chromosomes and reduced power for variant calling. We will incorporate sex chromosome biology to improve
alignment and variant calling on the sex chromosomes. Second, we will study the evolution of sex
chromosomes and X-inactivation in non-human animals, focused on our close evolutionary relative, the rhesus
macaque. Third, we will study gene expression variation (with an emphasis on X-linked gene expression and
X-inactivation) between the sexes, and between human populations in the human placenta. The placenta is the
one organ routinely expelled from the body that also provides a crucial interface during development, and is
not studied in current large-scale tissue expression projects. In collaboration with a long-term pregnancy
outcome study we will generate and comprehensively analyze population-specific sex-bias in the human
placenta. Fourth, we will study truly genome-wide patterns of variation (autosomes, X chromosome, Y
chromosome, and mtDNA) in African populations. Populations in Africa are the most diverse in the world, and
representation of that diversity is conspicuously absent from global population studies. In collaboration with
anthropologists, who are studying, cultural variation, we will use patterns of variation across the sex
chromosomes and autosomes to infer recent and ancient demography, informed by sex-biased migration and
demography. Finally, we will contribute novel training materials for instructors and study student learning and
self-efficacy as they learn genomics research skills. This work will improve methodology for studying sex-linked
variation, provide estimates of sex-biased human demography, elucidate sex-biased expression in the human
placenta, and utilize these research projects to improve training and inclusion of a diverse workforce."
11127936,"Accurate repair of DNA lesions is paramount to the survival of cells and to maintain their genomic stability.
Double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) are the most lethal DNA lesion, and cells have evolved a variety of
mechanisms for their repair. While some DSB repair pathways are accurate, others can destabilize the
genome by creating mutations or chromosome rearrangements associated with cancer and other human
diseases. Our long-term goal is to identify factors that drive DSB repair into the maelstrom of deleterious DNA
repair pathways, and to characterize their molecular mechanisms. We focus on two such high-risk DSB repair
pathways: 1) break-induced replication (BIR), an unusual type of long-tract repair DNA synthesis that promotes
bursts of genetic instabilities; and 2) microhomology-mediated BIR (MMBIR), a replicative pathway involving
multiple template-switching events at positions of microhomologies that yields complex genomic
rearrangements. We will use an extensively characterized, powerful yeast system to study repair of a site-
specific HO-endonuclease-induced DSB to inform the design of studies in other systems. MIRA support
enabled significant progress in our characterization of BIR and MMBIR, including development of several
innovative tools. One of them, which we named AMBER (Assay for Monitoring BIR Elongation Rate), is a
droplet-digital-PCR-based method to measure BIR kinetics with unprecedented resolution. Using AMBER
during the next MIRA support cycle will allow us to identify the specific steps of BIR that are controlled by our
newly identified BIR driver protein candidates, including spindle assembly checkpoint proteins. We will also use
AMBER in our sensitive yeast BIR system to unravel the mechanisms of BIR regulation following its collision
with various replication obstacles, including characterizing the role of Rad52-dependent single-strand
annealing for BIR re-start after collision. The obtained results will shed light on the mechanism of Rad51-
independent BIR in yeast, which is a pathway that is likely similar to BIR events described in mammals.
Another approach that we developed with MIRA support enabled the detection of BIR events based on long
mutation clusters formed by BIR occurring in the presence of APOBEC (cytidine deaminase), and we propose
to apply this methodology here to detect BIR during yeast meiosis. Determining how frequently mutagenic BIR
might be used to repair meiotic DSBs is important because similar events can lead to birth defects in humans.
Finally, our new software, MMBSearch—developed based on our characterization of MMBIR in yeast—will be
used to identify specific conditions that predispose human cells to MMBIR events, which we recently found to
be frequent in cancer, but rare in non-cancerous cells. Applying MMBSearch to whole-genome sequencing
data will identify specific cancers, cell types, chromosomal locations and environmental stressors that promote
MMBIR. Overall, this research program will produce fundamental knowledge on the factors that promote risky
DSB repair pathways and the mechanisms of these pathways that can destabilize eukaryotic genomes."
10897715,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Natural products from bacteria continue to be the frontline defense in the struggle against
bacterial infections, and have also found wide use as antifungals, anthelminthics, anti-cancer
drugs, and immunosupressants. One group of bacteria, the actinomycetes, has historically been
the deepest source of clinically-useful natural products. Over the last decade, numerous reports
have demonstrated that natural product biosynthesis often occurs in the context of actinomycete
interactions. These include interactions between microbes of different species, and cell-cell
coordination within colonies of single actinomycetes. Together, these findings have solidified the
idea that induction of natural product biosynthesis is socially driven in these bacteria. Despite
the importance of this social aspect, how these interactions unfold at the molecular level and
how interactions may best be harnessed for natural products discovery remain open questions.
The goals of this study are to understand how inter- and intra- species interactions activate
natural product biosynthesis at the molecular and systems levels, and to build framework for
translating these insights into natural product discovery. First, this work will examine how the
model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor activates expression of genes for antibiotic
production in the presence of other actinomycetes. This activation requires an unusual and
poorly understood signal transduction mechanism found in actinomycetes that shares parallels
with eukaryotic systems that rely on G protein activation. Second, this work seeks a systems-
level understanding of spatially coordinated antibiotic production within individual S. coelicolor
colonies. Knowledge generated from this objective may be employed to someday manipulate
cell fates within actinomycete cultures to drive natural products discovery and production. Third,
this work leverages actinomycete interactions for the discovery of novel natural products. This
research serves as a testbed for putting our knowledge of actinomycete interactions into
practice, with an emphasis on discovery of compounds with unusual mechanisms of action. In
its entirety, this work will illuminate the social drivers of natural product biosynthesis, and in the
long term, provide a foundation for harnessing microbial social cues and genetic regulation to
maximize future natural products discovery efforts."

The overall research direction in my lab is to develop new computational methods to enable new discovery in genetic
studies of human diseases. We design methods using machine learning models based on biological intuitions to extract
knowledge from large genome sequencing and functional genomics data sets.
Recent large-scale genome and exome sequencing studies of human diseases have successfully identified novel risk
genes and improved diagnostic yields in clinical genetic testing, especially in rare diseases, developmental disorders, and
cancer. However, many significant genetic questions remain unsolved and cannot be solved by the accumulation of genetic
data alone. Most of the risk genes of human diseases are still unknown. In particular, the role of rare variants has been
under-studied. One major bottleneck is the lack of highly accurate and automated tools to interpret genetic variation. Rare
missense variants account for most of protein-coding variants with potential functional impact; however, most of them
do not contribute to diseases. The inability to accurately predict their functional impact is a critical hurdle to identify risk
genes in genetic research studies and to disambiguate variants of uncertain significance in clinical practice. We see a
unique opportunity to dramatically improve computational methods in next five years, due to the following confluent
factors: accumulating large population genome sequence data, modern deep learning methods to model genomic and
protein sequence and structure, human functional genomics data across cell types and developmental stages, and scalable
methods to profile molecular effect of genetic variants. We will focus on three areas. The first is computational prediction
of functional impact of missense variants. We use deep neural networks to learn effective representation of protein
sequence and structure in prediction models and use probabilistic graphical models to jointly estimate effects at molecular
and population levels. The second is computational integration of functional genomics and genetics data. We will fuse
machine learning with statistical genetics to develop methods that model disease genetic data together with single cell
expression and regulatory profiles of normal individuals. The methods will improve both statistical power of new risk gene
discovery and generate biological insights of disease etiology. Third, we will continue to develop new bioinformatics tools
to improve detecting and automated confirmation of copy number variants and mosaic mutations from large-scale
genomics data.
Finally, our collaboration with experts in medical genetics will provide positive feedback loops to improve the methods
and generate new biological insights and clinical utility. Our research will produce new methods to analyze genomics data,
and ultimately these methods will enable new discoveries in disease genetic studies and improve the yield of clinical
genetic diagnostics."

Project Summary
Retinal-pigmented epithelium atrophy (RPE) that results in geographic atrophy (GA) in humans is one of the
leading causes for blindness in the industrialized world. This is because there is currently no treatment
available to prevent RPE atrophy and thus GA, which is an advanced form of Age-related Macular
Degeneration (AMD). The disease is characterized by focal RPE cell loss. Because the RPE maintains
photoreceptor homeostasis, photoreceptors die as well, which then leads to blindness. Recently, it has been
recognized that the high metabolic demands of photoreceptors may contribute to disease progression in AMD,
in particular, because photoreceptors and RPE metabolism are tightly linked. Two key findings imply
photoreceptors in disease pathogenesis. First, the distribution of soft drusen and subretinal drusenoid deposits
mirrors the distribution of cones and rods, respectively. This has led to the proposal that the metabolic needs
of photoreceptors are what drives deposit formation. Second, macular translocation procedures, which were
developed to save macular cones from dying RPE cells revealed that the new region where the cones where
translocated redeveloped GA. Here it is thought that the high metabolic demands of cones are what causes
RPE stress. However, whether photoreceptor metabolism differs between AMD patients and non-diseased
individuals remained unclear. We recently showed that PRs of AMD patients display signs of nutrient
derivation as they upregulate genes associated with an adaptive response to a glucose shortage. By
mimicking this adaptive response in mouse photoreceptors we were able to induce a subset of pathologies that
are reminiscent of those seen in humans with AMD, including focal RPE atrophy. The goal of this project is to
identify what exactly causes the pathologies seen. We propose in aim 1 to further analyze our model and to
determine how RPE cells die. Thereafter, in aim 2, we will dissect genetically the signaling pathway that we
have used to manipulate photoreceptor metabolism in order to hone in on the metabolic changes that cause
disease. Finally, in aim 3, we will use metabolomics, lipidomics and transcriptomics to identify the underlying
gene expression changes that cause disease and test putative candidate mechanisms in vivo.
Accomplishment of the proposed research will help understand how photoreceptors can cause RPE atrophy."

 Warfarin remains one of the most commonly prescribed drugs and a leading cause of emergency
hospitalizations. Warfarin use is especially common in medically underserved patients such as African
Americans (AAs) and Latinos, which is particularly concerning since AAs and Latinos suffer worse outcomes
due to suboptimal warfarin therapy. Thus AAs and Latinos can derive a distinct benefit from warfarin
pharmacogenomic (PGx) algorithms, which maximize safety and efficacy by predicting individualized warfarin
dose. However, currently available PGx algorithms have critical limitations, including a lack of generalizability to
non-white populations and a failure to account for 50 percent of variability in warfarin dose. Under-representation
in clinical studies, the propensity to cause adverse events, and a lack of consideration of admixed populations
in clinical PGx guidelines are all factors that contribute to limited utility of warfarin PGx algorithms in diverse
populations. Many potential sources of warfarin stable dose variability remain critically unexplored, including the
role of vitamin K biosynthesizing bacterial species, the influence of local ancestry at warfarin pharmacogenes,
and the potential for machine learning techniques to enable accurate warfarin dosing algorithms in diverse
populations. This proposal addresses the overarching hypothesis that warfarin stable dose prediction can be
improved by incorporation of gut microbiome data, measures of local ancestry, and machine learning in diverse
populations. We will pursue three Specific Aims (SAs) to test this hypothesis: (SA1) Determine the impact of
abundance of vitamin K biosynthesizing bacteria from the gut microbiome on warfarin stable dose and; (SA2)
Determine the influence of local admixture on warfarin stable dose in admixed populations; (SA3) Optimize
warfarin PGx algorithms for diverse populations using machine learning. In SA#1, we will conduct a clinical study
with fecal sample collection at anticoagulation clinic visits and perform whole genome bacterial sequencing to
identify the effect of vitamin K biosynthesizing bacterial species on warfarin stable dose. In SA#2, we will estimate
African, European, and Native American local ancestry in warfarin pharmacogenes in a large, admixed
population (n=1194) and determine its effects on warfarin stable dose. In SA#3, a large, diverse population of
warfarin treated patients (n=7366) will be used to develop machine learning models and test improved prediction
of warfarin stable dose over existing linear regression models. Our studies overcome major limitations of
previous warfarin PGx studies by leveraging gut microbiome data, local ancestry, machine learning, and diverse,
admixed populations. The outcomes of this work will provide a framework for local ancestry investigation with
other PGx drug-gene pairs, enabling use of clinical PGx guidelines in admixed populations. This research has
the potential to identify new sources of variability in warfarin dose, improve the safety and efficacy of warfarin
treatment, and reduce disparities in PGx research for medically underserved patients."

environment for collaboration among faculty and trainees. This training grant will support five
highly qualified physician-scientist trainees through two years of rigorous scientific training, with
the objective that they will successfully devote their subsequent careers to the study of the
rheumatologic diseases."
10835947,"Project Summary
NLRP3 (NOD-Like Receptor Protein 3) is an intracellular sensor that detects a variety of stimuli including
infection and metabolic dysfunction resulting in assembly of a macromolecular signaling complex called the
inflammasome which promotes caspase-1 dependent processing of the cytokines IL-1b and IL-18 to their
bioactive forms; these cytokines in turn underlie the pathophysiology of many autoinflammatory, autoimmune,
metabolic and infectious diseases. NLRP3 is activated by a wide-range of molecules including monosodium
urate crystals, viral RNA and even bacterial pore-forming toxins, but little is known about the mechanisms by
which NLRP3 senses and elicits a response to these chemically and structurally dissimilar stimuli. We and
others have previously shown that NLRP3 associates with mitochondria upon activation. Whether this link
simply points to a requirement for a membrane platform to achieve efficient solid-phase assembly of
inflammasome signaling components or an active modulation of NLRP3 activation by mitochondrial
components or even mitochondrial proteins remains ambiguous. It is also unclear if and how interaction of
NLRP3 with mitochondria influences mitochondrial functions. We have previously shown that NLRP3
mitochondrial recruitment and the ensuing inflammasome response is dependent on interaction of a short N-
terminal sequence in NLRP3 with the outer mitochondrial adapter protein MAVS. However, MAVS specifically
augments inflammasome assembly in response to non-crystalline, but not crystalline NLRP3 activators
suggesting an interesting and complex mechanism by which mitochondria regulate NLRP3 inflammasome
activation. In this study, we propose that additional mitochondrial proteins control NLRP3 inflammasome
activation in response to different activators, conceivably in a stimulus-specific manner. In response to
detection of RNA viruses MAVS is engaged not only by NLRP3 but also by the RIG-I- like receptors (RLRs) to
produce type 1 interferons, suggesting an unexpected crosstalk between the NLRP3 and RLR signaling
pathways. In this proposal, we will elucidate the mechanisms by which mitochondria/MAVS regulate NLRP3
activation and examine its crosstalk with the RLR pathway. This will be accomplished by: 1) mass
spectrometry to identify additional mitochondrial proteins that associate with inflammasome complexes in
response to crystals and non-crystalline NLRP3 activators, followed by assays to evaluate their effect on
inflammasome activation and mitochondrial functions, 2) soft X-ray tomography and correlative fluorescence
microscopy to assess a requirement for subcellular membrane platforms in inflammasome assembly, and 3)
models of viral infection to identify the physiological consequences of MAVS-dependent crosstalk between the
NLRP3 and RLR pathways. These investigations will yield important mechanistic insights into how
mitochondria and MAVS regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which may be of relevance for modulation
of NLRP3 activity not only in viral infections but also in a variety of metabolic diseases."

Oral health is vital for overall health and quality of life, as exemplified by the importance of teeth in mastication,
speech, and esthetics, and by recent connections made between oral health and diabetes, heart disease,
preterm birth, and Alzheimer's disease. Periodontal disease, the breakdown of the connective tissues around
the teeth, is one of the most prevalent diseases on earth, affecting 47% of adults and 70% of adults over the age
of 65. The periodontal complex is a unique joint composed of two hard tissues, cementum and alveolar bone,
and an intervening and unmineralized periodontal ligament (PDL). Periodontal disease leads to destruction of
periodontal tissues and tooth loss if left untreated. Therapeutic approaches to regenerate or repair periodontal
tissues are unpredictable at present, in part because of gaps in knowledge regarding molecules guiding dental
and periodontal development. Our goal is to more successfully promote periodontal tissue repair, regeneration,
and return to function. Factors directing cementum and alveolar bone mineralization are key for proper
periodontal development and function, and likely play important roles in tissue repair. Bone sialoprotein (gene:
Ibsp; protein: BSP) is an extracellular matrix protein highly expressed during cementum and alveolar bone
formation. BSP has several putative biological roles based on its highly conserved functional domains involved
in collagen binding (hydrophobic N-terminal domain), hydroxyapatite nucleation (polyglutamic acid sequences),
and RGD-integrin cell signaling (C-terminal motif). BSP was demonstrated to be important in skeletal
development, as genetic ablation in Ibsp knockout (Ibsp-/-) mice resulted in a skeletal phenotype marked by mildly
delayed long bone mineralization and reduced trabecular bone remodeling. However, ablation of BSP causes
even more dramatic effects in dentoalveolar tissues, where Ibsp-/- mice exhibited lack of cementum, severely
hypomineralized alveolar bone, disrupted dental attachment, periodontal breakdown, and tooth loss. We
hypothesize that BSP directs osteoblast function and mineralization activities and plays an important role in
periodontal and alveolar bone repair. We will test this hypothesis in the following three aims: Aim 1: Define the
binding location of BSP on type I collagen to define spatial mechanisms by which BSP may contribute to ECM
mineralization. Aim 2: Elucidate the mechanistic roles of the RGD integrin-binding domain and the collagen-
binding domain using newly generated cementoblast cell lines and mutant mice with a knock-in mutation
inactivating the RGD motif. Aim 3: Investigate the efficacy of BSP to enhance alveolar bone healing using
exogenous native rat BSP (nBSP) to investigate its use as a therapeutic in promoting alveolar bone repair.
Importantly, insights gained will aid not only in regeneration of alveolar bone surrounding teeth or necessary for
dental implant placement, but will also be potentially applicable towards healing critical size bone defects and
fractures, and ameliorating or reversing systemic bone disorders such as osteoporosis."

The overall goal of this Maximizing Investigator’s Research award renewal application is to understand the
integration of complex signaling networks at both the single cell and multi-cellular level during wound healing.
Despite progress in understanding the signals that guide wound repair, there remains a significant gap in
understanding how different types of cells communicate to integrate a wound healing response. This gap limits
our ability to design new therapeutic strategies for a broad range of human disease including diabetes, cancer,
cardiovascular disease and autoimmunity. The overall focus of our research is to understand the basic
molecular mechanisms that regulate cell migration and how defects in cell migration contribute to
human disease in the context of tissue damage and repair. The optical transparency and ease of genetic
manipulation make zebrafish an ideal model system to dissect multi-cellular and tissue interactions during wound
repair. During the prior funding period, we invested significant effort in developing new tools for imaging and
manipulating cell dynamics, cell guidance cues, metabolism and matrix remodeling during wound healing in both
simple and complex wound models. We performed large-scale TRAP (translating ribosomal affinity purification)-
RNAseq and identified context- and cell-type specific gene expression changes. Using genome editing we are
now poised to uncover new signaling mechanisms and guidance cues that regulate neutrophil reverse migration
and inflammation resolution, and influence matrix remodeling during wound healing. Understanding how
wound repair is orchestrated and integrated at both the single cell and multi-cellular level, including the
role of microbial interactions, in the different types of tissue damage is the focus of our future research.
The overall goal of our work is to identify key signaling networks and guidance cues that mediate cell migration
during wound repair, dissect how they are altered in pathological conditions and ultimately may be targeted to
understand and treat human disease."

 The objective of this proposal is to unlock the full potential of nanopore sequencing.
This sequencing method has transformative intrinsic qualities, such as long read length,
direct epigenetic modification detection, fast sample-to-answer, portability and low cost-
to-entry, but relatively low sequencing accuracy remains a significant drawback.
 With NHGRI funding, we have built a team that has played a pivotal role in
developing nanopore sequencing, first engineering the highly sensitive pore MspA to
provide single-nucleotide resolution and then combining it with enzyme control for the
first proof-of-concept of nanopore sequencing. Recently, we developed a hybrid-
voltage-enzyme control method that provided a substantial increase in nanopore
sequencing accuracy. Concurrently, we developed a nanopore single-molecule tool that
measures the kinetics of enzymes which move along DNA or RNA at unprecedented
detail.
 Here we build on our previous research and propose well-founded and innovative
methods to further increase the accuracy of nanopore sequencing with the ultimate goal
of a single-passage base calling accuracy of around 99%.
 Our specific aims are (1) to use sequence-dependent enzyme kinetics to create a
second reader in the nanopore system that runs in tandem to the ion current reader.
This reader will provide sequence information that is independent of the ion current
reader. We will engineer enzymes with accentuated sequence-dependent kinetics. (2)
We will systematically map the sequence-dependent enzyme kinetics and splice this
information into novel base calling algorithms. In addition, we will measure the ion
current of all four different orientations of the pore-enzyme-DNA complex to maximize
the accuracy with this new method. (3) We will engineer better sequence specificity into
the ion current reader by creating a robust platform that permits asymmetric assembly
of MspA. We will then design MspA with an asymmetric pore constriction to reduce
Brownian motion of the DNA and enhance nucleotide recognition.
 Our team's success to date has enabled us to form partnerships with prominent
collaborators and to gain support from many excellent labs in academia and industry,
whose expertise assists us in each step forward. We will work with our partner labs to
complete the aims outlined in this proposal."

Women disproportionately experience violence compared to men;21-23 however, violence against women is not
distributed randomly. Due, in part, to their stigmatized identity, sexual minority women (SMW) are 2-3 times
more likely to face violence than heterosexual women.21, 24-26 Many women use alcohol to cope with the
negative sequelae of violence (e.g., PTSD).28 This comorbidity may be exacerbated among SMW given their
experiences of psychosocial stressors (i.e., violence and minority stressors such as discrimination).11 Despite
the public health necessity of developing targeted alcohol treatment approaches for victimized SMW, current
alcohol treatment models do not specify unique stressors and clinical needs of this population. Consistent with
the NIAAA’s research priorities,11, 14 the K01 will provide major advances in understanding biopsychosocial
mechanisms (e.g., minority stressors, physiological reactivity, PTSD) and moderators (e.g., race/ethnicity)
influencing the heterogeneity in hazardous drinking among SMW as well as the role that these core factors
play in SMW’s differential need for and response to treatment. The project will include: 1) an epidemiologic
assessment that uncovers distinct combinations of psychosocial stressors among SMW, identifies racial/ethnic
differences in classes of psychosocial stressors, and determines how these patterns of psychosocial stressors
predict comorbid PTSD and hazardous drinking over 11 years (n = 450-600); 2) a lab-based study that advances
knowledge of the influence of minority stressors on allostatic load (e.g., salivary cortisol, heart rate, heart rate
variability, and skin conductance) among victimized SMW (n = 125); and, 3) a once-daily ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) approach over 21 days that determines the role of minority stressors as
antecedents to daily fluctuations in PTSD and hazardous drinking using the same sample of SMW from the
lab-based study. The proposed training plan in this K01 application will provide essential knowledge and skills
that the principal investigator, Jillian R. Scheer, PhD, needs to become an independent, interdisciplinary
alcohol scientist. The advanced training acquired by Dr. Scheer via this timely and innovative project will target
3 objectives: (1) rigorous alcohol research methodology and its application to studying determinants of
hazardous drinking patterns; (2) physiological measurement of stress reactivity as a tool to assess biological
mechanisms underlying the influence of minority stressors on comorbid PTSD and hazardous drinking; and, (3)
EMA approaches to assess the proximal effects of minority stressors on daily comorbid PTSD and hazardous
drinking among racially diverse SMW. Dr. Scheer will be primarily mentored by John Pachankis, PhD, at Yale
University, with additional mentoring from Tonda Hughes, PhD (Columbia University), Rajita Sinha, PhD (Yale
University), Tami Sullivan, PhD (Yale University), Joshua Warren, PhD (Yale University), and Robert Pietrzak,
PhD, MPH (Yale University). Dr. Scheer’s training through the K01 award will ensure her success as an
independent scientist whose work informs public health and clinical efforts to reduce alcohol use among SMW."
10786078,"Bone grafts are used in various clinical settings to aid bone repair and regeneration. In recent years, the United
States, as well as other countries worldwide, have experienced an increasingly high demand for functional bone
grafts. This includes the US military and the VA healthcare systems, where there is a high demand for bone graft
substitutes to repair critical-size bone defects, fracture non-unions, and orthopedic reconstruction incidents to
battlefield trauma. Current repair processes use the patient’s own bone tissue harvested during reconstructive
surgery. However, autograft donor sites are limited in the amount of tissue available, and secondary surgical
sites are usually required. While allografts harvested from cadaveric sources eliminate the need for secondary
surgical sites and have the advantage of being osteoconductive, they are associated with the risk of host rejection
and accelerated graft resorption. The downsides of autograft and allograft bone techniques have impelled the
development of bioengineered graft materials. As part of this quest, we developed apatite-based bone scaffolds
through a VA SPiRE Grant (# 1I21RX003328-01A1). Our data showed that, in 12-weeks, the pores within the
fluorapatite scaffolds became completely filled with viable new bone tissue, demonstrating the efficacy of these
scaffolds in regenerating bone tissues. To further develop this novel material for clinical applications as an
“autograft-like” bone scaffold for the repair of critical-size defects, we propose combining our scaffold with stromal
vascular fraction cells as an osteogenic cell source. Thus, it is hypothesized that fluorapatite (FA)
scaffoldings seeded with patients’ own stem cells, contained within the stromal vascular fraction (SVF)
that is extracted from autologous fat tissue, will have the ability to generate new osseous tissue at a
level comparable to that of autograft bone in both a non-weight bearing critical-size defect model and a
weight-bearing fracture model. This hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will
determine the optimal number of SVF cells needed for repairing bone defects in a rat model. Specific Aim 2 will
investigate the osteogenic potential and time-course of bone regeneration of FA scaffolds, with and without SVF,
in a critical size bone defect in a sheep ilium model. mRNA-based techniques will be used to highlight the
mechanistic differences in bone regeneration as a secondary outcome in the latter time-course study. Finally,
Specific Aim 3 will investigate the efficacy of the FA scaffolds, with and/or without SVF, in a sheep weight-
bearing tibial fracture model. FA with and without SVF will be compared to the clinical gold standard, autograft,
as well as FDA-approved hydroxyapatite scaffold. It is expected that such a combination treatment of SVF and
FA scaffolds will provide a potential source of “off-the-shelf” scaffolding materials for clinical bone repair and
regeneration and improve the health and quality of life for a significant number of military personnel, veterans,
and civilians requiring skeletal reconstruction."

The last four decades have produced an enormous catalog of human genomic variants which has the potential
to revolutionize human genetics. Among the variants identified in the human “variome” so far, some appear
benign, i.e. they don’t seem to confer any particular phenotype, a significant proportion are associated or
potentially associated with one or more genetically inherited disorders, but an even greater percentage of
observed human variants, 99% of missense variants, remain uninterpreted or annotated as variants of unknown
significance (VUSs). To translate this huge amount of genetic information into general principles underlying
genotype-phenotype relationships as well as molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of inherited
disease, there is an urgent need for large-scale, systematic, high throughput “functional characterization”
projects such as those envisioned within the new “Impact of Genomic Variation on Function” (IGVF) Consortium
proposed by NHGRI.
Although most monogenic Mendelian disorders are individually rare, when combined these diseases affect 20
million Americans. The ClinVar database describes within 3,671 Mendelian disease genes over 260,000
missense variants classified as pathogenic, benign, or VUSs. We currently lack strong and comprehensive
evidence to systematically analyze coding variants across the spectrum of human Mendelian diseases.
We propose to functionally characterize ~100,000 variants across most of the known Mendelian disease-
associated genes by comparing wild-type, or “reference”, gene products and their corresponding variants for a
rich array of fundamental protein properties and phenotypic impacts, including protein stability (expression),
subcellular localization, cell viability, cell morphology, and the ability to mediate macromolecular interactions with
protein partners.
Our Variant Characterization Across the Mendelian Proteome (VarChAMP) Center will generate a searchable
and widely available catalog of these variant effects via the IGVF Data and Administrative Coordinating Centers
(DACCs), and assist in the “Predictive Modeling Projects” to carry out variant effect predictive modeling using
this data. In addition to providing a rich source of functional information on tens of thousands of genomic variants
in the next five years, all of our concepts, technologies and resources generated during this project are exportable
and will be shared to enable others, both inside and outside the IGVF consortium, to leverage our approach in
their own studies and expand the catalog."

Fracture healing is a significant health issue for patients with diabetes despite the availability of insulin.
Strategies
to improve fracture healing are underdeveloped due to concerns of costs, effectiveness and side-effects.
Preliminary data demonstrate that lineage specific deletion of the transcription factor FOXO1 in chondrocytes or
osteoblasts completely rescues diabetes impaired fracture healing measured histologically, by microCT or
mechanical testing. We also determined that lineage specific loss of cilia, restricted to chondrocytes or
osteoblasts, interferes with fracture healing and mimics diabetic fracture healing. Based on these exciting data
we have conceived an application focusing on the role of FOXO1 and primary cilia in chondrocytes and
osteoblasts as important contributing factors to deficient fracture healing in diabetics. Thus, the proposed studies
will test the hypothesis that diabetes results in upregulation of FOXO1 and concomitant downregulation and loss
of cilia, which in turn causes a loss of cell specific signaling needed to activate chondrocytes/osteoblasts and
consequentially leading to deficient fracture healing. To address the therapeutic benefits of this hypothesis we
have developed a nanofiber hydrogel with controlled release of an insulin-like growth factor-1 mimetic, called
NFH-IGF. There are two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine if FOXO1 suppresses ciliogenesis and downstream
signaling pathways needed to activate healing responses in chondrocytes and osteoblasts in diabetic fracture
healing. Specific mechanisms will be tested using the newly developed CyTOF technology and mice with
targeted deletions of IFT80 to inhibit ciliogenesis, deletion of FOXO1 or double deletion of FOXO1+IFT80. Aim
2 will further develop a novel device with controlled release of a mimetic with IGF-1 activity, nanofiber hydrogel-
IGF (NFH-IGF). The goal is to determine whether NFH-IGF treatment improves T1DM and T2DM diabetic
fracture healing. Mechanistic studies will determine whether NFH-IGF downregulates FOXO1 and upregulates
cilia in chondrocytes and osteoblasts to enhance intracellular signaling pathways that stimulate these cells. We
anticipate that proposed studies will not only result in new knowledge about the role of cilia in diabetic fracture
healing but also result in the development in a novel therapeutic aid for the treatment of T1DM and T2DM using
nanofiber hydrogel-IGF formulations."

research that suggests computerized trainings/interventions may enhance social skills72,73 and social cognitive
task performance21,22,74, the research team will leverage community stakeholders (e.g., researchers; educators;
service providers; families; and individuals with ASD) to guide the development.
SOCIAL-Work will allow TAY-ASD to build the knowledge and skills required for effective workplace interactions.
TAY-ASD will navigate through a fictional 3-D workplace with a peer-coach. Tier 1 of instruction, Understanding
People in the Workplace, will include nine modules focused on foundational social cognitive strategies. Tier 2,
Workplace Conversations, will include three PeopleSim practice conversations (i.e., responding to customer
needs, building rapport with a coworker, and debriefing with a supervisor). Tier three, Virtual Workday, will
integrate knowledge and practice with interconnected workplace activities were the actions made early in the
day influence conversations later in the day (e.g., a poor customer interaction may result in constructive feedback
from a supervisor). Consistent with a scaffold model of learning94,95, SOCIAL-Work will automatically progress
TAY-ASD through the tiers as they successfully achieve learning goals.
During Phase I, the research team will prototype SOCIAL-Work and recruit TAY-ASD (n=30) and teachers (n=10)
to provide feedback on its acceptability, usability, and feasibility of integration. During Phase II, the team will
complete development and conduct a randomized controlled effectiveness-implementation trial in which TAY-
ASD enrolled in school based transition services (n=338) will be randomly assigned to the attention control or
intervention groups. We hypothesize that TAY-ASD who receive training with SOCIAL-Work, will show greater
(compared to their active control peers) gains in (H1) social cognition and (H2) work-based social functioning,
(H3) reduction in anxiety about work-based social encounters, (H4) sustained employment by 9-month follow-up.
This proposal has garnered commercial support from education systems, community service providers, families,
and TAY-ASD. If successful, this research could lead to the development of a novel and scalable intervention,
and SOCIAL-Work will have with sufficient scope and rigor to help fill a critical gap in employment services by
preparing transition-age youth with ASD to become more socially competent at work."

Alzheimer’s disease is ravaging the world’s elderly population and creating a heath and societal burden that
appears likely to increase. Basic research can inform on mechanisms relevant to late onset neurodegenerative
disease and suggest avenues of treatment. Healthy aging of the brain requires meticulous maintenance of
protein synthesis/folding/degradation systems, and this capacity is often disrupted in neurodegenerative
disease. Recently it has come to be appreciated that disease neurons can produce toxic products like
aggregated proteins that can be taken up by neighboring cells—there is speculation that this mechanism might
be involved in disease spread within the brain. How neurons generate and send out large-sized extracellular
material in vivo is an open question that must be addressed as we consider therapeutic intervention.
We study the aging nervous system in the simple animal model C. elegans, in which individual neurons, as
well as labeled aggregates within them, can easily be visualized in the living animal. We have unexpectedly
discovered that some C. elegans neurons can exude large packets we call “exophers”. The contents of these
dramatically expelled exophers can contain introduced human disease protein aggregates. Multiple
approaches to exaggerating protein folding stresses in those neurons, including over-expressing human
Alzheimer’s disease associated fragment A 1-42, and genetically or pharmacologically impairing branches of
protein homeostasis, increase exopher formation. Aggregated proteins extruded in exophers can be taken up
by distant cells.
We hypothesize that we have identified a previously unrecognized alternative route for adult neurons to clear
protein aggregates. We speculate that this mechanism, and the associated mechanism of release and uptake
by surrounding cells, is conserved across species and related to currently unknown mechanisms operating in
human brain relevant to neurodegenerative disease.
We propose to exploit the considerable advantages of the C. elegans model system (transparent body, easy
genetic manipulation, exquisitely defined nervous system, powerful cell biology, short lifespan) to advance
understanding of exopher biology. Our goals are to: 1) probe the biology of old age exophers (induction,
functionality, and longevity gene interface); 2) screen human neurodegenerative disease-related genes for
roles in C. elegans exopher formation; 3) begin to decipher the mechanism whereby AIP-1, needed for
exopher production and known to protect against broad proteotoxicity, influences exopher-genesis under
proteo-stress.
Our work should inform on a novel pathway of cell maintenance relevant to both healthy brain aging and a
neurodegenerative disease, defining a new area for study and for development of clinical interventions."

Aabida Saferali, PhD, is an academic researcher with a focus on the genetics of respiratory diseases, whose
overarching career goal is to become an independent investigator with the skill set to utilize integrative ‘omic
techniques for the improved biological understanding and clinical management of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The proposed research combines
her prior experience in genetics and transcriptomics with training in long-read sequencing, advanced
integrative ‘omics, and biostatistics, in order to address the fundamental issue of identifying disease causing
genes in GWAS loci. The hypothesis of this proposal is that transcriptional regulation through RNA
splicing plays an important role in COPD development and pathogenesis. This will be explored by
leveraging existing data from two well-phenotyped studies of lung disease: COPDGene and the Lung Tissue
Research Consortium. Specific Aims: (1) characterizing gene expression and splicing in smokers and
testing for associations with COPD case-control status and lung function; (2) discovering expression
quantitative trait loci (QTLs), splice QTLs and transcript ratio QTLs and using these data to explain
GWAS findings; and (3) using long-read RNA sequencing to characterize full-length isoforms
associated with disease and definitively identifying splicing patterns. The innovative research plan, which
utilizes novel methodologies to characterize splicing, will identify COPD GWAS loci involved in alternative
splicing. It is accompanied by a training plan, which will provide Dr. Saferali with the skills to complete the
research aims, as well as the experience to transition to independence and submit an R01 expanding upon the
characterization of isoform diversity in COPD using long-read sequencing. In particular Dr. Saferali has four
training goals which build upon her existing background in respiratory genetics. (1) To strengthen her
knowledge of biostatistics and statistical genomics; (2) to expand her integrative ‘omics skill set; (3) to
gain experience and expertise in the generation, analysis and interpretation of long-read sequencing
data; and (4) to deepen her understanding of study design and mentoring. She is supported by a
mentoring team with complementary skillsets and successful mentoring careers, which, together with her
experience and training, will guarantee the success of this proposal. The findings may pave the way for the
development of targeted therapeutics and personalized approaches, while exploring a novel methodology to
address one of the most important analytic challenges in the field today: characterization of isoform diversity
using RNA sequencing."
10833554,"Project Summary
 Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition characterized by altered neural circuitry
underlying threat and emotion processing. PTSD is twice as prevalent in women than men, and menstrual cycle
phase has been implicated in sex differences, but the neural circuitry of PTSD is poorly characterized in women.
A consistent finding is that PTSD is associated with increased resting state activity of dorsal anterior cingulate
cortex (dACC) and decreased activity of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), reflecting exaggerated
emotional responding and dampened emotion regulation, respectively. PTSD is also associated with decreased
functional connectivity in the theta frequency range (4-7 Hz). The dACC appears to be a generator of theta range
brain activity, which has been implicated in PTSD; however, no prior research has probed theta-based resting
state dACC and vmPFC activity, or theta-based dACC-vmPFC connectivity in PTSD. Further, no prior research
has examined these effects in women based on menstrual cycle phase. In addition to resting state deficits, fear
conditioning studies have shown that PTSD is associated with increased late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes
in response to fearful stimuli, reflecting exaggerated emotional encoding. While there are well-established effects
of menstrual cycle phase on the LPP, no prior research has tested these effects in women with PTSD.
Characterization of this neural circuitry and the moderating role of menstrual cycle phase represent critical gaps
in understanding how women experience greater risk for PTSD.
 To address these unmet needs, we will take a multi-modal approach to PTSD brain circuitry by testing
resting state and event-related neurophysiological deficits in trauma-exposed women with and without PTSD.
We will use high-density EEG to probe theta-based resting state activity of the dACC and vmPFC, as well as
dACC-vmPFC functional connectivity in PTSD. We will then probe event-related deficits by measuring the LPP
and its underlying cortical sources during fear conditioning. Finally, we will collect estradiol and progesterone to
determine menstrual cycle phase and test its moderating effects on these phenomena. The applicant will learn
to use state-of-the-art physiological methods such as standardized Low Resolution Electromagnetic
Tomography (sLORETA), power envelope connectivity analyses, ERPs with source localization, and serum
hormone assays. Using the temporal resolution of high-density EEG, this study will provide a more nuanced and
mechanistic understanding of fear circuitry deficits in women with PTSD. Our overall goal is directly in line with
Objective 1 of the NIMH’s Strategic Plan: “Define the Mechanisms of Complex Behaviors.” Specifically, the
proposal will further elucidate the neurophysiological circuits and mechanisms underlying PTSD in women. By
leveraging advanced EEG techniques, this study will ultimately contribute to the improvement of PTSD
treatments by improving our understanding and informing individualized approaches (e.g., stimulation of the
vmPFC to regulate dACC activity, adjusting approaches based on menstrual cycle phase)."

The goal of this research is to provide a roadmap to maintain periodontal health by understanding the
mechanisms which underlie the variation in inflammatory responses within the human population. Ultimately,
this information will be translated to individualized preventive and treatment regimens based on host response
phenotype. Periodontitis is one of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases in adults worldwide and a
major public health concern. According to the latest World Workshop in Periodontics there is immense potential
in studying gingivitis, an antecedent reversible disease state, as a means of primary prevention of periodontitis.
Healthy periodontal tissue exists in a homeostatic relationship with its accompanying oral microbiome. In most
individuals, this relationship results in a combination of host and microbial derived immune components that
produce an active inflammatory surveillance protective state. This is termed healthy homeostasis. Disruptions of
this healthy homeostatic state occur during episodes of both experimental and natural gingivitis, which is defined
as reversible inflammation of the gingiva. The ability to induce a reversible inflammatory state in humans has
provided a unique foundation to examine microbial-host interactions that dictate periodontal health and disease
via the human Experimental Gingivitis (EG) model. We will capitalize on our previous work with the highly
translational human experimental gingivitis model where we have identified three distinct clinical response
phenotypes, which behave differently to bacterial-driven inflammation. We will use these clinical phenotypes as
a foundation to explore the variability in the human inflammatory response. Specifically, we will determine the
contributions of host components and microbial ecological succession patterns to the observed variations among
responder types. The approach for this proposed research is to determine the bacterial and host processes in
stages of health through disease using advanced parallel multi-omic measurements of both bacteria and host
components coupled with ex vivo and in vitro mechanistic studies to determine the host and associated microbial
functions that determine the variation in host responses. We will employ a comprehensive combination of
functional meta-omics in parallel (DNA and RNA 16S sequencing, metagenomics, metabolomics, custom
multiplex Immunoassay of host mediator panels) along with complementary cultivation approaches for
hypothesis testing. We anticipate there will be an immediate benefit from our proposed detailed investigations in
terms of the comprehensive multi-omic datasets we will generate and make available – enabling responder types
to be identified and further characterized across studies. In the longer term, this fundamental mechanistic work
has direct clinical and therapeutic value by identifying potential critical targets during disease initiation and
development within each of the different response types that can translate to personalized treatment and
intervention strategies."
10817101,"Broadening Participation in the Biomedical Sciences with Utility Value Interventions
ABSTRACT
The goal of this program of research is to broaden the participation of first-generation (FG) and
underrepresented ethnic minority (URM) students in biomedical fields with utility-value
interventions in gateway biology and chemistry classes. Using a theoretically grounded utility-
value intervention, PI aims to close achievement gaps for FG students, those for whom neither
parent obtained a 4-year college degree, and for URM students. A previously funded large-scale
double-blind randomized study in introductory biology courses at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison (UW) demonstrated that the utility value intervention (UVI), in which students write
about the personal relevance of course material, was successful in reducing the achievement
gaps for FG and URM relative to a control condition in which students summarized course
content. The proposed research will (1) test whether UVI effects documented at UW can be
replicated in different gateway courses and different universities, (2) test whether the UVI can
be adapted for a more diverse student sample, and (3) test the long-term effects of the UVI by
following students over time through graduation. PI will analyze the results of a recently
completed large-scale multi-site study conducted at three sites. Two versions of the UVI and
control writing assignments were tested with more than 7,000 students across 10 academic
semesters of biology and chemistry in 3 different institutions: UW, University of Maryland,
Baltimore County, and San Diego State University. By testing two versions of the UVI across
three universities, and following students through graduation, PI can answer three critical
questions. First, by testing a new prosocial version of the intervention and comparing it to the
established “personal” version, as well as a control group, PI can draw new inferences about the
impact of having students reflect on ways that they can use their education in biomedical fields
to help others, give back to their community, or make a contribution to society. Second, because
PI has collected data from large groups of students from diverse racial/ethnic, socioeconomic,
and cultural backgrounds, the data provide the best opportunity to date to test intervention
effects for different groups of students in gateway courses. Third, long-term follow-up of
students in the multi-site project will help us understand how and why this intervention can be so
powerful in broadening participation in the biomedical sciences."

We propose an Institutional Training Grant to train 8 Postdoctoral Fellows in basic, clinical and rehabilitation
science relevant to translational vision research at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute (SKERI).
Eighteen faculty whose expertise spans the areas of spatial and binocular vision, eye movements, strabismus,
central vision loss, low vision and blindness rehabilitation, computer vision and assistive technology are
available to train the postdoctoral fellows. The goal of the Fellowship program is to transition postdoctoral
fellows towards independent research careers by the end of their 2-year fellowship. To this end, the program
encourages the Fellow to develop an independent research project in collaboration with the mentor, to test and
hone these ideas, and distill them into a grant proposal. The training will also provide a solid grounding in rigor
and reproducibility and in the responsible conduct of research, as well as frequent and wide-ranging seminars,
journal clubs and colloquia. Because the vast majority of SKERI Faculty are full-time researchers with no
teaching duties and small laboratories, the Fellows experience a great deal of direct interaction with their
sponsors. In addition, the Fellows have available to them many opportunities for interaction with the rest of the
Faculty, which include basic, clinician and rehabilitation researchers. These interactions are facilitated by the
researchers all being housed within the same building and all working in clinically relevant vision research. The
Faculty-Fellow interactions represent all areas of the research process: proposal, critique, performance, and
communication of findings through the writing of papers and preparation of presentations, as well as
participation in scientific and ethics seminars. Importantly, Fellows are also in frequent contact with each other
through organized events, adjacent open work-spaces, and the numerous collaborations among Faculty. The
Fellowship program forms a critical component of the research vitality and capacity of SKERI. Because SKERI
is not a degree-granting institution, its investigators do not typically have graduate students. It is widely
appreciated within the Institute that Fellows bring in new ideas and techniques to the preceptors’ laboratories.
The process of training Fellows encourages Faculty to challenge old assumptions, to develop clear and
concise descriptions of why a given research activity is of significance, and to expand the range of approaches
to research problems. The T32 Program will significantly augment SKERI’s internally funded Rachel C.
Atkinson Fellowship, C.V. Starr Scholarship Program, and individual Fellowship awards from other sources to
yield an overall program size of approximately 8-10 post-doctoral fellows."

10851978,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Viruses are able to infect every kind of organism on the planet. They play an integral part in maintaining normal
ecosystems but sometimes cause perturbations that have adverse impacts on human health, agriculture, and
the wider environment. Understanding the role that viruses play in ecosystems and developing approaches to
mitigate their undesirable effects represents a major goal of virologists.
Organisms can only be understood in the context of their relationships. This begins with the delineation of
common and distinguishing properties and is formalized by the science of taxonomy which creates an ordered,
hierarchical system of classification and nomenclature. Taxonomy is critical for building a holistic understanding
of the biology of the organisms that inhabit this planet. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
(ICTV) provides a coherent framework for understanding viruses by classifying them on the basis of their kinships
as described by the virus taxonomy. The ICTV taxonomic database and programs form the bedrock used by
virologists worldwide to understand the global virome, standardize the nomenclature of the huge influx of newly
discovered viruses, and promote both research and education in a rapidly changing environment. This proposal
is aimed at expanding the effectiveness of the ICTV and strengthening its connections to a broad range of
stakeholders. These include people involved in scientific, veterinary, medical, educational, and regulatory
endeavors, and anyone else interested in viruses.
Our aims focus on providing an integrated set of outcomes that modernized resources to ensure a stable,
responsive, scalable infrastructure; increased availability and breadth of taxonomic and virological information;
better tools to manage taxonomic classification and handling of data supporting high-throughput virus
classification and curation; enhanced accessibility by individuals, groups, and information repositories; and
outreach and training activities to ensure that the products of our efforts are used to benefit stakeholders and to
promote better understanding of viruses and their classification.
This work will advance the capacity of bench scientists, computer scientists, educators, trade regulators,
pharmaceutical firms, government agencies, policy makers, and the general public to conduct leading edge
research, mitigate the threat posed by viruses, and better understand the risks posed by viruses to human,
animal, and agricultural health, and the planet’s ecology. This work will also contribute to national and
international security by helping governments to respond to unforeseen outbreaks of virus diseases such as
COVID-19."

Project 4: Redefining CM Using Multidimensional Endophenotypes Predictive of Long-Term Outcome
Chiari type 1 malformation (CM) is a common and potentially debilitating disease typically defined by caudal
displacement of the cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum. While radiographic CM may be found in 1%
or more of the population, this population is extremely heterogeneous. Patients with classically defined CM may
be clinically asymptomatic or present with severe symptoms such as debilitating headaches or signs of brainstem
or spinal cord malfunction. Furthermore, patients with similar clinical presentations may have distinct genetic
profiles and comorbid diagnoses that suggest differing etiologies contributing to superficially similar disease.
Increasing recognition of this heterogeneity has emphasized the need for a data-driven approach to
reclassifying traditionally-defined “CM.” Furthermore, advances in contemporary methods in imaging,
genomics, and patient-centered clinical measures have substantially expanded opportunities for phenotyping
complex diseases, such as CM. Leveraging Washington University’s unique strengths in these areas, the overall
objective of Project 4 is to derive clinically relevant, multidimensional endophenotypes within traditionally-
defined “CM” to inform clinical management and optimize long-term patient outcomes. In particular, we expect
these multidimensional endophenotypes will both aid in outcome prediction and also provide new biological
insights regarding disease pathogenesis, thereby supporting personalized treatment strategies. We intend to
pursue this objective through three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will apply well-established unsupervised and semi-
supervised clustering methods to multidimensional clinical and radiological data to derive novel clusters in a
large, multicenter dataset. We will then externally validate those multidimensional endophenotypes in three
external, multicenter datasets. In Aim 2 we will compare differences in disease presentation across clusters and
also use state-of-the-art genetics and advanced imaging techniques to obtain new insights into biological
differences underlying CM heterogeneity and pathogenesis. In Aim 3 we will examine the association between
these clusters and important CM outcomes (e.g., change in quality of life, postoperative complications). We will
then use prediction modeling to examine how both cluster identity and other characteristics impact these
outcomes. Finally, we will use a Modified Delphi Approach to create a novel treatment framework based on this
Project’s findings along with structured feedback from experts in the research and clinical management of CM.
Taken together, this Project’s results will offer a fundamentally new data-driven approach for classifying CM. We
expect these findings will have an immediate impact on clinical management practices and will guide future
research in this field."

The overall objective of this K23 application is to provide support for the additional training and experience that
Dr. Joy Wan, a pediatric dermatologist and epidemiologist, needs to develop an independent, patient-oriented
research program in pediatric atopic dermatitis and chronic skin disease. Research: Atopic dermatitis, also
known as eczema, affects 20% of children and frequently overlaps with the critical period of cognitive
development that occurs in the first two decades of life. Although children with atopic dermatitis are more likely
to suffer from learning disabilities, inattention, and poor memory, the impact of atopic dermatitis on cognition
has not been rigorously examined. This project will: (1) test the hypothesis that atopic dermatitis, particularly
when severe or persistent, is both directly and indirectly associated with cognitive impairments in children, and
(2) identify modifiable risk factors that mediate the effects of atopic dermatitis on cognitive function. To achieve
these aims, Dr. Wan will use data from a longitudinal study of over 14,000 individuals followed from birth until
their 20s and also prospectively enroll a cohort of children with active atopic dermatitis. The results of this
project will fill critical gaps in knowledge about the impact of atopic dermatitis on cognition and carry significant
implications for clinical practice. Candidate: Dr. Wan earned her MD and MSCE degrees from the University of
Pennsylvania, where she also completed dermatology residency followed by pediatric dermatology fellowship
at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Dr. Wan is pursuing post-doctoral training in epidemiology with the
goal of becoming an R01-funded investigator and leader in pediatric dermatology research. Environment: Dr.
Wan will be primarily mentored by Dr. Joel Gelfand, a dermatologist and epidemiologist with expertise in
patient-oriented research in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and co-mentored by Dr. Susan Furth, a pediatric
nephrologist with expertise in chronic disease epidemiology and patient-oriented pediatric research, Dr. Kristin
Linn, a biostatistician with expertise in advanced statistical methods, and Dr. Nina Thomas, a pediatric
neuropsychologist with expertise in neurocognition research. She will be further advised by a complementary
committee of NIH-funded investigators in pediatric dermatology, neuropsychology, epidemiology, and atopic
dermatitis. With its robust research infrastructure and rich resources, Penn provides an ideal environment for
Dr. Wan’s research and career growth. Career Development: Dr. Wan’s proposal includes advanced training
in longitudinal data analysis and causal inference, neurocognitive development, and patient-reported outcome
measures, achieved through a combination of didactic coursework, practical research experience, and focused
mentorship. The support of a K23 award will enable Dr. Wan to launch a successful career as an independent
investigator dedicated to optimizing the health, social, and life outcomes for children with chronic skin disease."

 My long-term career goal is to improve caregiver and patient dyad outcomes by developing family-
centered psychosocial interventions that enhance education, support, and skill-building in caregivers of
moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI) survivors. The training activities in my K23 proposal include:
(1) mentored experiential learning; (2) seminars, workshops, and conferences; (3) didactic coursework; and (4)
skills developed by completing the study aims. Training will be overseen by my Primary Mentor (Opeolu
Adeoye, University of Cincinnati (UC)), and Co-Mentors (Tamilyn Bakas, UC; Shari Wade, UC; Brad Kurowski,
UC). Additional training will be obtained by working with Collaborators (Heidi Sucharew and Paula Shear, UC;
and Carrie Collier, Bowen Family Systems Theory Research Group). My research will test Caregiver Wellness
after TBI (CG-Well), a skill-building, education, and support intervention I have developed. I will be prepared to
submit an R01 for a large Phase III clinical trial at the completion of the K23 award.
 After injury, survivors of msTBI depend on informal family caregivers. Upwards of 77% of family
caregivers experience poor outcomes, such as adverse life changes, poor health related quality of life, and
increased depressive symptoms. Caregivers frequently report minimal support or training to prepare them for
their new role. Periods of care transitions, such as ICU discharge, are most difficult. The majority (93%) of
previously developed caregiver and caregiver/survivor dyad interventions after msTBI focus on providing
information or practical skills to either survivors, or to long-term caregivers (>6 months post injury), rather than
education, support, and skill-building that the new caregiver may use proactively that will benefit the dyad
acutely after injury. The Aims of this proposal are to: (1) Determine feasibility, satisfaction, and data trends of
CG-Well; and (2) Understand how baseline psychosocial risk factors affect response to CG-Well compared to
an Information, Support, and Referral control group. To accomplish this, I will first enroll 6-10 caregivers and
tailor CG-well until each finds the intervention acceptable, appropriate, and feasible. I will then enroll 100
(50/group) dyads and determine satisfaction ratings, recruitment, retention, and treatment fidelity of CG-Well.
Additionally, I will determine if caregivers report reductions in depressive symptoms and improvements in life
changes as a result of improvements in task difficulty and threat appraisal in CG-Well compared to ISR at six
months. Information obtained in Aims 1 and 2 will be used to plan a larger Phase III trial of CG-Well.
Completing these Aims and the training plan will improve outcomes of caregivers and downstream outcomes
of survivors of msTBI, and provide me with the skillset necessary to become an independent researcher who
can develop and test high-impact, high-fidelity, sustainable interventions."

Enzymes that employ transition metals can initiate chemically challenging modifications
of inert chemical bonds. These systems serve as both important drug targets and useful
biocatalysts. In certain transition-metal driven essential biological transformations, such
as DNA biosynthesis, divergent trace elements can be used for reaction initiation.
Discovery of novel metal cofactors used for these processes, and their mechanisms of
assembly and deployment, will enable novel routes of enzyme inhibition in bacterial
pathogens. In a second project, structures and reaction mechanisms in three different
metalloenzyme superfamilies relevant to biocatalysis will be elucidated. These systems
use a common cofactor to catalyze divergent reaction outcomes, controlled by structural
features of each enzyme. A comparative approach provides detailed and testable
hypotheses about the means by which distinct chemical reactions are accomplished, as
well as discovery of entirely new families of enzymes and new ways to control their
activities. The objective of this work is to enable exploitation of the catalytic power
inherent in these systems for more efficient and environmentally friendly synthesis of
drugs, chemicals, technological tools, and new chemical processes."
10845376,"Project Summary
During motor preparation, millions of interconnected neurons work together to give rise to a ‘planned’ movement.
We currently know little about the brain circuits and the communication between them in an intact nervous system
during the preparation for shoulder or shoulder and hand combined movements. This gap in basic knowledge
blocks the investigation of motor deficits in pathological conditions, such as hemiparetic stroke and Parkinson’s.
A central movement plan is sent to targeted muscles via descending pathways. In humans, both corticospinal
tracts (CSTs) that largely bypass the brainstem, and cortico-reticulospinal tracts (C-RSTs), via the brainstem,
project to the upper extremity muscles. Although both proximal muscles and distal flexors receive projections
from C-RSTs, distal extensors receive relatively less. Thus, the CSTs remain the primary resource for recruiting
distal extensors. Therefore, we hypothesize that in able-bodied adults, distinct communication among various
cortical areas, as quantified by cortical-cortical-connectivity (CCC), drives the CST and modulates the
brainstem’s excitability to increase or decrease the reliance on the RSTs. This modulation is dependent on motor
pathway connectivity (aim 1) and motor demands (aims 2 and 3). Forty able-bodied adults will be recruited to
participate in the designed experiments in all three aims. In aim 1, participants will self-initiate hand opening
(OPEN) or arm lifting (LIFT) task 5-6 s after a ‘ready’ sound (80dB); or move as quickly as possible after either
a ‘go’ (80dB) or a ‘startling’ (115dB) sound that occurs 1.5-3 s after the ‘ready’ sound. We will quantify the default
CCC for the self-initiated motor tasks, and the startle responses following a ‘startling’ sound compared to a ‘go’
sound. Because the startling sound activates the reticular formation and releases the prepared movements via
RSTs, a short reaction time (< 120ms) will ensure the use of RSTs. Besides, because RSTs branch to multiple
spinal segments, increased muscle co-activation patterns will reflect an increased brainstem activity during motor
preparation. We expect to demonstrate that preparatory CCCs for OPEN and LIFT are different in healthy adults
because shoulder abductors are more strongly innervated by RSTs, and finger extensors are primarily innervated
by CSTs. In aims 2 and 3, participants will perform LIFT (aim 2) or hand opening while arm lifting (OPEN+LIFT,
aim 3) against various shoulder abduction loads. We will demonstrate that CCCs will show motor demand-
induced alterations that either increase or suppress the brainstem’s excitability.
The proposed study will establish the default CCCs prior to OPEN, LIFT, or OPEN+LIFT tasks for the first time.
We will also demonstrate the neuroanatomical connectivity- and task demand-dependent cortical modulation of
the brainstem’s excitability in able-bodied adults. The proposed basic research fits the NINDS's focus for
understanding an intact central nervous system's ‘normal’ workings for movement control. Results are
anticipated to pave the way for the future investigation of motor preparation in neuro-pathological conditions."

 To expand the kidney-related biomedical workforce and counter the increasing disparity between the growing
prevalence of renal disease and the disproportionate level of trainees, researchers and practitioners in
nephrology and kidney health, we developed the Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education
Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health). ADVANCE Kidney Health is an education-
based, hands-on research, education and clinical experience that applies pillars of 1) science, medical and
engineering education; 2) training in innovation, entrepreneurialism and scientific translation; 3) experiential
learning, mentorship and clinical immersion; and 4) needs-based application and practical translation – all aimed
at producing motivated, trained and committed biomedical trainees interested in renal health and science to
advance the workforce and develop the new health-related therapies of the future. The program recruits
undergraduate students from across 15 departments within the College of Engineering at the University of
Arizona (UArizona) that include: Biomedical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical
Engineering and Chemical Engineering. ADVANCE Kidney Health is structured to provide trainees a medical
school experience for early-stage undergraduate learners geared to instill an understanding of renal anatomy
and kidney function. The core structure accesses a clinical experience to instill a motivation to pursue kidney-
related patient care and/or translational research and progresses to an already established innovation bootcamp
that culminates in an interdisciplinary capstone that has doubled in size over 10 years and accesses by more

10833513,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to significant neuropsychiatric problems and neurodegenerative pathologies
that develop with time after injury. These issues may be propagated by neuroinflammatory processes that
continue well after the initial injury. Pt.3 We have reported that diffuse TBI in mice leads to “microglial priming”
within cortical and hippocampal regions, in which the microglia remain in a sensitized state and are highly
inflammatory following an immune challenge 30 days post injury (30 dpi). In this application, we show a distinct
phase transition from acute (8-24 h) to sub-acute (7 d) and then to chronic (30 d) cortical-inflammation/microglia
priming after TBI. Acutely, there was an inflammatory response after TBI that evolved into a subacute phase 7
dpi that was dominated by interferon (IFN) type I signaling. IFN responses are activated by cell distress and
damage to promote an immune response that can prime innate immune cells, including microglia. We provide
evidence of cortical neuronal damage 7 dpi with corresponding microglial activation. Pts.3&6 Single cell RNA
seq (scRNAseq) of the cortex 7 dpi shows unique clusters of microglia, trauma-associated, that are influenced
by IFNs. These microglia are involved in dendritic remodeling and suppression of neuronal homeostasis. At 30
dpi, there was cognitive impairment (associated with HPC & CTX), reduced network connectivity, and increased
immune reactivity of primed microglia. Microglia are critical in these processes because microglial elimination
(CSF1R antagonist) prevented TBI-induced neuroinflammation and IFN signaling, attenuated dendritic atrophy,
and improved network connectivity. Thus, we hypothesize that increased interferon signaling is critical in
promoting microglial priming and chronic neuroinflammation, dendritic remodeling, and cognitive decline. To
address this, three aims are proposed using a midline fluid percussion injury in mice. In Aim-1, we will eliminate
microglia to determine the influence of microglia on other CNS cells in the cortex and hippocampus acutely, sub-
acutely, and chronically after TBI. ScRNAseq will be used to determine the transcriptome signature of microglia
over time and in parallel with astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons at 3 these critical times after TBI. The
focus will be determining which cells express IFNs and IFN receptors, and how they respond to increased IFN
signaling with TBI. In Aim-2, we will determine if IFN signaling is critical in chronic neuroinflammation, pathology,
cognitive decline, and microglial priming after TBI. Here, we will attenuate IFN signaling at the levels of IFN-a/b
receptor activation (IFNαRKO, Mgl-IFNαRKO) and IFN production (STINGKO) to determine the extent to which
these interventions ameliorate neuroinflammation, pathology, and microglial priming. In Aim-3, we will determine
if TBI-induced microglial priming, chronic neuroinflammation, and cognitive decline 30 dpi are reversed by forced
microglia turnover. We will remove microglia (CSF1R antagonist) when IFN responses are highest 7 dpi, and
allow for microglial repopulation to 30 dpi. Completion of these aims will provide new insight on the IFN pathway
that appears to be critical in the transition from acute to chronic inflammation mediated by microglia after TBI."
10836458,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Proteins drive essential functions of life as well as aberrant functions in disease, making the development
artificial molecules that mimic proteins a significant challenge in biomedical research. The problem of protein
mimicry is rooted in the hierarchy that defines protein structure, where covalent connectivity gives rise to local
folding motifs, unimolecular arrangements of such motifs, and multi-chain assemblies. The construction of
sequence-specific oligomers with artificial backbones and defined folding propensities is a powerful approach
to peptide and protein mimetics. Most precedent with such scaffolds has focused on isolated secondary
structure. Creating more complex tertiary folding patterns presents a formidable challenge, as it requires the
design of both backbone connectivity and side-chain sequence that will result in multiple biomimetic
secondary structures that pack in a defined way in a single chain. Addressing this challenge has the potential
to advance artificial protein-like chains toward the functional versatility of biomacromolecules.
 A unifying theme underlying research in the PI’s laboratory is the design, synthesis, and application of
molecules that are inspired by proteins but expand beyond natural constraints of covalent connectivity. A
major goal in this work, supported in prior awards from NIGMS, has been the development of strategies for
producing protein tertiary structure mimetics from artificial bio-inspired backbones. The central hypothesis
guiding this effort is that any protein can be treated as a chemical entity with two orthogonal sequences: one
of side-chain functional groups and a second of backbone units that display those functional groups.
Systematic engineering of backbone composition in a prototype sequence from nature can yield a
heterogeneous-backbone analogue with similar fold and function. In work to date, design rules have been
conceived for the construction of such agents, the impacts of altered composition on folding examined, and
the functional potential of these molecules explored. The present application seeks to advance this program
through continued effort across four complementary research areas.
 From a practical standpoint, artificial backbone composition can impart useful properties, such as
enhanced biostability, and tune biological activity. In fundamental terms, changing backbone characteristics
in ways not possible with traditional mutagenesis can further understanding of natural biomacromolecules.
An important aspect of the concept underlying the research is that it addresses the problem of tertiary
structure mimicry by an approach that is generalizable, as natural sequences serve as the starting point for
design of their own mimics. Further, while the molecules are synthetic, the design principles are applicable in
the context of new emerging approaches to biological production of protein-like artificial chains."

The Hawaii Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (HI-INBRE) is
a collaborative outreach partnership between the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM), the state’s Primarily
Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) and University of Hawaii Community Colleges (CCs). The long-term goals
are to strengthen and expand the biomedical research capacity within the state of Hawaii, to nurture research
collaborations within Hawaii and throughout the greater INBRE network, to enhance professional development
of faculty and students at Hawaii INBRE partner institutions, and to provide research resources to partner
institutions. In our current cycle (INBRE IV), we established new funding mechanisms for promising
investigators at different career stages at the PUIs and CCs. These INBRE investigators were provided funds
and strong mentoring, thereby establishing research programs within conventional teaching institutions.
Another accomplishment of INBRE IV was the enhancement of hands-on research experiences and career
enhancement activities for students throughout the Hawaii INBRE network. For the next cycle (INBRE V), we
will build on these successes and strengthen the statewide network through targeted efforts to invest in
research capacity and the diverse human potential of Hawaii INBRE partners. Hawaii INBRE V will focus on
promoting effective data and resource sharing within the statewide network and the INBRE Western region, to
build stronger collaborations between Hawaii INBRE and other research programs such as the Hawaii Centers
of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBREs), and to enhance science and technological capacity of Hawaii’s
workforce. With guidance from our Steering Committee and our seasoned External Advisors, we will
accomplish the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: To strengthen the biomedical research expertise and infrastructure of HI-INBRE participating
institutions.
Specific Aim 2: To provide support to postdoctoral fellows and faculty at participating institutions via our
Developmental Research Project Program.
Specific Aim 3: To provide student research experiences (SRE) at PUIs and CCs as a crucial first step in
establishing a pipeline for these students to pursue biomedical research and workforce careers.
Specific Aim 4: Expand and enhance a state-of-the-art Data Science Core to support Hawaii INBRE
researchers and students"
10834950,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE SUMMARY
Through the direction and management efforts of the Administrative Core leadership and the Coordinators of
the associated Core activities, the Hawaii INBRE has effectively implemented successful programs focused on
research training, career development, and enhancement of investigators, postdoctoral fellows, and students
of the institutions involved in the network. A major goal has consistently been to facilitate effective growth and
development of the network and enhance diversity within the biomedical research workforce, and this will
continue to be our focus as we enter the next cycle of INBRE V. The Administrative Core will be led by an R1
institution, the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UH Manoa), and will work with the Internal Executive Committee
(IEC) and External Advisory Committee (EAC) along with the steering committee (SC) to effectively provide
advice and recommendations to the participating institutions in the network. The Administrative Core will
leverage the combined resources of the network to support the development of focused research investigators
at the primarily undergraduate institution (PUI) and community college (CC) partners, provide opportunities for
advanced undergraduate (UG) student research experiences (SRE) throughout the network, and support of a
state-of-the-art Data Sciences core to provide cutting-edge services to our INBRE students and investigators at
all stages of development. With its partner institutions located on three islands in the state of Hawaii, separated
by large distances and several time zones from the U.S. mainland, Hawaii INBRE is challenged by several
unique circumstances. It is axiomatic then, that the success of such a vital research-capacity building program
is dependent largely on the construct, dedication and management skills of the leadership team in the
Administrative Core. Hence, in INBRE V, we have assembled a consummate team of dedicated and skilled
administrative and scientific leaders to continue the trajectory of its past success and to accomplish the
following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1. Provide strong administrative leadership with oversight from three advisory committees.
Specific Aim 2. Manage the entirety of HI-INBRE including PATHway to Biomedical Careers for student
research, Developmental Research Project Program (DRPP) for investigator support and development, the
Data Science Core, and Evaluation activities.
Specific Aim 3. Expand HI-INBRE’s collaborative outreach to include programs beyond our Hawaiian borders"

Mental health and substance misuse pose some of the greatest risks to the health and wellbeing of American
Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities and result in intergenerational morbidity and mortality. These
risks are the legacy of historical trauma, ongoing discrimination, and chronic underfunding of mental health and
substance use care, resulting in massive care and treatment gaps. Simultaneously, many AI/AN communities
emphasize a holistic view of wellbeing centered around family and community, and prefer upstream
preventative and family-based interventions with potential to disrupt intergenerational cycles of trauma and
adversity. Our team of Indigenous and allied researchers has worked closely with participating communities to
design and pilot the Family Spirit Strengths (FSS) intervention, designed to provide transdiagnostic skills-
based preventive strategies to mothers and primary caregivers at elevated risk for mental health and
substance use disorders. We propose a Hybrid Type I Effectiveness-Implementation design with the primary
goal of testing FSS effectiveness at reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and substance use, among N =
188 primary caregivers across three diverse Tribal settings and contexts. Participants will be randomized to
receive FSS or a beneficial control, which is an evidence-based nutritional support program called Family Spirit
Nurture. Primary outcomes will be measured at 6 months post-enrollment. We will also seek to characterize
heterogeneity in and mechanisms of FSS effects by exploring moderators and mediators, respectively, guided
by both Western and Indigenous theories of action. As part of our Hybrid approach, we will estimate FSS
costs, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact. Finally, we will undertake a process with National stakeholders to
understand barriers to and facilitators of FSS implementation across the country, including co-design of
implementation strategies to support FSS at scale across diverse AI/AN communities. This study is responsive
to Program Announcement PAR-20-238 and focuses on key areas of interest including the testing of evidence-
based practices in community settings (MH-22-170) and expanding perinatal mental health interventions (MH-
21-215, MH-21-270). Our overall objective is to rigorously test a secondary preventative intervention designed
to be embedded in home visiting programs so that we can extend the reach of mental and behavioral health
services in AI/AN communities across the country."
10811636,"Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs) are chronic hematologic disorders that are associated with significant
morbidity and mortality and have the potential to progress to myelofibrosis and a blast phase. These diseases
are characterized by a series of driver mutations that originate at the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) level,
however, the mechanisms driving disease progression are currently unclear. Current therapeutics for MPNs
largely do not alter the disease course and it is therefore imperative to decipher the mechanisms underlying
progression in order to identify new, more effective therapeutic agents. This proposal focuses on elucidating
the role of Phosphatase Mg2+/Mn2+ Dependent 1D (PPM1D) in MPNs and evaluating it as a potential target to
prevent MPN disease progression. PPM1D is involved in the maintenance and differentiation of HSCs and has
recently been found to be mutated and/or overexpressed in a subset of MPN patients. Preliminary data shows
that PPM1D mutation/overexpression leads to increased fitness of the JAK2 mutated MPN clone and that
PPM1D inhibition depletes MPN HSCs. To further discern the consequences of dysregulated PPM1D in MPNs
we will complete the following aims utilizing a multipronged approach involving primary MPN samples, human
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines and murine models: (1) Delineate the effects of PPM1D
dysregulation on molecular signaling in JAK2V617F+ human hematopoietic cells, (2) Assess the in vivo
consequences of PPM1D overexpression on MPN disease phenotype, (3) Identify therapeutic vulnerabilities of
MPN cells with dysregulated PPM1D function. Experiments will employ a variety of techniques including
biochemical assays, murine transplant models, primary hematopoietic cell colony assays, RNA sequencing
and genotyping of transcriptomes. This proposal will also evaluate a novel strategy to target PPM1D in MPNs.
Dr. Bridget Marcellino, an assistant professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, will be
completing these studies under the mentorship of Dr. Ronald Hoffman, a scientific leader in the field of MPNs.
She will have 75% of protected research time and will be provided the necessary resources to complete these
studies. As an institution Mount Sinai is ideal for fostering the development of physician-scientists with
academic seminars and state of the art facilities and resources. Bridget will also have an advisory committee
consisting of Dr. Eirini Papapetrou at Mount Sinai, Dr. Ross Levine at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center, Dr. Dan Avi Landau at Weill Cornell Medical College and biostatisticians, Dr. Amylou Dueck and Heidi
Kosiorek at Mayo Clinic. The career development plan outlined here will allow Dr. Marcellino to gain scientific
expertise as well as increase her skills in manuscript and grant preparation. This proposal will facilitate Dr.
Marcellino to achieve both her short term goal of publishing her findings and her long term goals of developing
as a physician-scientist and establishing an independent research program focused on identifying novel
therapeutic targets in MPNs."

 Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common extra-cranial solid tumor in the pediatric population of the
United States by incidence. RMS is a high-grade neoplasm composed of cells that resemble skeletal myoblasts and
express some markers of myogenic differentiation but do not form functional myotubes. The standard systemic therapy
for RMS consists of intensive multi-agent chemotherapy and has not significantly changed in nearly five decades. These
compounds target general vulnerabilities of rapidly dividing cells and are not specific to the pathophysiology of RMS. As
such, treatment is accompanied by a suite of toxicities with potentially lifelong repercussions in pediatric patients.
Approximately 20% of RMS patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis, and the failure-free survival rate for
these patients is only 30% after five years. Hence, there is a pressing need for specific yet potent therapies for RMS.
 High-throughput, negative-selection genetic screens across cell lines of varying tumor types have the potential to
reveal growth dependencies specific to a given cancer. Our results from these functional genomics experiments identified
myogenic differentiation 1 (MYOD) as the most potent growth dependency factor specific to RMS. MYOD is a member
of the basic Helix-Loop-Helix family of transcription factors and is a master regulator of muscle differentiation. MYOD is
one of the predominant myogenic markers used in the clinical diagnosis of RMS but has long been thought to be
functionally inactive in RMS, as this cancer does not complete the myogenic differentiation program. However, in light of
our genetic screening data, we hypothesize that RMS exploits the transcriptional activity of MYOD to drive growth of the
tumor. The proposed research aims to determine the molecular mechanisms by which MYOD regulates growth of RMS.
The outlined experiments will identify features of MYOD necessary for sustaining RMS growth (Aim 1), uncover the
genetic targets of MYOD that mediate growth (Aim 2), and evaluate the functional significance of MYOD targets (Aim
3). Data from these experiments will provide insight into the molecular pathophysiology of RMS and may reveal critical
nodes in this program that warrant therapeutic investigation.
 The requisite skills and knowledge to carry out this research proposal will be supported by the integrated basic
and medical science education in the Medical Scientist Training Program at Stony Brook University (SBU). The
mentorship and environments at SBU and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory will provide all of the necessary resources for a
tailored training program to effectively develop the applicant into an independent experimentalist, analyst, and
communicator of cancer research."
10841030,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Older Samoans are a unique population for gaining knowledge about cognitive resilience. Dementia has
been reported as occurring at low rates among them. Further, our recent pilot data from Independent Samoa
found that although there was variability in their memory scores, older Samoans had scores that did not
significantly differ from younger Samoans. The proposed study will examine factors that might contribute to this
cognitive resilience: (a) unique positive age beliefs that predominate in Samoan culture; and (b) the recently
identified CREBRF gene variant (rs373863828) that occurs in 45% of Samoans, but in less than 1% of non-
Samoans.
 Previous research supports our premise that these cultural and genetic factors will contribute to cognitive
resilience. The Principal Investigator conducted the first studies to demonstrate that culture-based positive age
beliefs predict lower stress and better aging cognitive health, including lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s-
disease biomarkers and dementia. This age belief-cognition finding has been supported by three meta-analyses,
but has not been studied among Samoans. Additionally, our pilot data with older persons living in Independent
Samoa showed the CREBRF gene variant predicted significantly better cognitive scores, and previous studies
have shown this gene variant is associated with lower levels of type 2 diabetes and fasting blood glucose, both of
which are associated with lower dementia risk. Further, the gene variant is part of a larger mechanism, present in
everyone, that leads to the development of brain neuroplasticity. Because favorable environmental factors can
increase this neuroplasticity, positive age beliefs (which tend to be assimilated from culture) may stimulate the
neuroplasticity property of the CREBRF gene variant.
 Thus, our Specific Aims, which will be carried out for the first time, are to examine whether aging cognitive
resilience is predicted by: (a) greater adherence to the prevailing positive Samoan aging beliefs; (b) the
CREBRF gene variant; (c) a synergistic interaction of positive age beliefs and the gene variant; and (d) structural-
level factors (i.e., Westernization, ageism and usefulness to others) as well as individual-level factors (i.e., ethnic
identity and self-relevance of age beliefs) acting as moderators of a gene-culture interaction.
 We will assess the CREBRF gene variant and age beliefs at baseline, and cognitive resilience across three
years, among 750 Samoans, aged 60 and older. We will recruit one third from each of the following (in ascending
order of Westernization): Independent Samoa, American Samoa and San Francisco, CA.
 The proposed research has the potential to benefit cognitive aging health because it could identify a set of
modifiable age beliefs and moderators for interventions and identify a new biological pathway to cognitive
resilience in all older persons."
10810702,"Project Summary/Abstract
Dopaminergic neurons (DANs) are a molecularly, anatomically and functionally heterogeneous neuron group
that is essential for learning across animal phyla. In the midbrain, distinct populations of DANs are responsible
for memories with different valence or stability. Thus, the dopamine system comprises parallel subsystems,
each of which operates as a qualitatively distinct learning system. This raises two important questions: 1. How
does the heterogeneity of DANs impact synaptic plasticity to form distinct types of memories in each
subsystem? 2. How are the signals from parallel subsystems integrated to ultimately trigger a unified behavior?
Answers to these questions are required to understand the logic that governs the parallel memory systems.
The mushroom body (MB), the major associative learning center in the Drosophila brain, is an excellent model
to tackle these questions because it comprises dopamine subsystems, each of which is clearly defined by a
unique set of DANs and MB output neurons (MBONs). These individual MB compartments support distinct
types of memories that vary in valence and stability, properties shared with mammalian dopamine subsystems.
However, in both invertebrate and vertebrate brains, it remains an open question whether the diversity of
memory properties is derived from intrinsic characteristics of DANs or from an extrinsic circuit architecture. Aim
1 will test the hypothesis that combinations of DAN cotransmitters define compartment-specific rules of
synaptic plasticity and thereby determine the memory properties. By identifying novel DAN cotransmitters and
their physiological and behavioral roles, the causal relationship between plasticity rules and memory properties
will be tested. In Aim 2, integration mechanisms of different types of memories will be determined by identifying
neurons that pool input from multiple MBONs. Synaptic integration, behavioral roles and activity changes after
learning will be determined in these integrator neurons. In this project, cell-type-specific transcriptome and the
comprehensive connectome data available in the field will guide our molecular and circuit interrogation by in
vivo electrophysiology, calcium imaging and behavioral assays. Collectively, this project will address
fundamental questions regarding the heterogeneous organization of the dopamine systems and pioneer the
circuit motif that is currently inaccessible in vertebrates."

Compelling clinical evidence has linked diabetes with increased fracture risks and impaired bone healing.
Suppressed bone turnover is a common feature in both type I and type II diabetes. Therefore, use of
bisphosphonates, which are the main stay of osteoporosis treatment but further suppress bone turnover, may
exacerbate bone quality deterioration in the long term. The current bone anabolic drugs however have limited
use in diabetic patients, particularly diabetic children, due to black box warnings. Thus, there remain
tremendous unmet needs for safe and effective bone anabolic drugs. A thorough understanding of cellular
metabolism in diabetic bone is essential for rational designs of novel bone therapies, but research in this area
has been hampered by the lack of adequate knowledge about normal metabolism in bone cells. In recent years
we and others have uncovered new details about the metabolic signatures of osteoblasts and osteoclasts,
therefore providing a solid foundation for investigating the potential dysregulation of bone cell metabolism in
the context of diabetes. As type 1 diabetes (T1D) is the most common form of newly diagnosed diabetes in
childhood, we focus our present study on T1D by employing the Akita mouse that harbors a spontaneous point
mutation in the Ins2 gene causing postnatal apoptosis of pancreatic ß cells. We propose to test the central
hypothesis that type I diabetes disrupts normal osteoblast metabolism and that enhancement of
glucose metabolism in osteoblasts can mitigate diabetic bone defects. We test the hypothesis in three
specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize the bone defects at the cellular level in the diabetic mouse. Aim 2 will
detail the metabolic defects in osteoblasts caused by diabetes, and specifically investigate the role of insulin.
Finally, in Aim 3 we will test genetically whether stimulation of glycolysis ameliorates the bone defect in the
diabetic mouse. Successful completion of the proposal is likely to open a new avenue for developing bone-
enhancing drugs."

Knowledge of protein motion is necessary to bridge the gap between structure and function and gain insight
into the molecular mechanism of protein machines. My lab studies the function of ion channels and ion-coupled
transporters, integral membrane proteins that must undergo structural transitions to regulate the flow of ions
(channels) or actively pump substrates (transporters) across biological membrane barriers. A set of distinct but
interrelated projects examines the mechanism of secondary active transport, promiscuous multidrug
recognition, ion channel selectivity and gating, molecular basis of temperature sensing, allosteric regulation of
transporter and channel activity, and how small localized interactions can regulate broader dynamics in
membrane proteins. These research questions span time- and length- scales, requiring an array of
experimental approaches and a well-developed set of model systems to enable hypothesis driven research.
One of our primary tools is NMR spectroscopy, which can simultaneously provide structural, thermodynamic
(populations), and kinetic (rates of transitions) data with site-specific resolution. NMR chemical shifts are also
highly sensitive to changes in the local environment, providing a direct readout of proton binding, a process
that is otherwise difficult to monitor experimentally but central to dissecting proton-coupled transport. Over the
past 10 years, my lab has done the painstaking work necessary to develop three completely independent
model transporter and channel systems (EmrE, NaK, Shaker-VSD) and establish experimental tools ranging
from NMR and molecular biophysics to in vitro and in vivo functional assays. We are now primed to address
essential research questions that probe the molecular mechanism of these specific systems but also have
broader implications for understanding how protein conformational change is regulated, promiscuity versus
specificity in substrate recognition, the complexity of proton-coupled transport, and molecular basis for
allosteric regulation of protein function."
10835928,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
RNA splicing is a key feature of human gene expression and a major contributor to expansion of genetic
information by alternative splicing. Splicing is carried out by a large and dynamic cellular machine called the
spliceosome. Spliceosomes are composed of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) that assemble on
precursor transcripts (pre-mRNAs) to remove introns and splice together exons. This process must occur
precisely in order to preserve the genetic information carried in the mRNA. Critical for splicing is the correct
identification of the sites of RNA bond cleavage and formation [the 5' and 3' splice sites (SS) and the branch
site (BS)]. A number of different ATPases contribute to the fidelity of SS and BS recognition as well as carry
out extensive compositional and conformational remodeling of the spliceosome. Recently, biochemical studies
of splicing have been transformed by determination of dozens of different structures of yeast and human
spliceosomes by cryo-EM. Despite this structural revolution, much remains unknown about central features of
the splicing reaction. The goal of my laboratory’s research is to elucidate mechanisms of spliceosome
assembly and regulation in biochemical depth using a variety of techniques. We often use single molecule
fluorescence microscopy to deconvolute the complex and heterogeneous reaction pathways employed by the
splicing machinery. In recent work, we have studied mechanisms of 5'SS and BS recognition, assembly and
dynamics of the U6 snRNP, and developed methods for fluorescently-labeling, purifying, and inhibiting RNAs
and RNPs. Our vision for the next five years is to merge the insights obtained from structures of spliceosomes
with single molecule, biochemical, computational, and genetic experiments to address outstanding gaps in our
knowledge of splicing. These gaps include fundamental principles of RNP folding and assembly, the
mechanisms of regulated splicing, and the scarcity of specific and effective chemical inhibitors of the
spliceosome. As part of this vision, we will answer the following questions using multi-disciplinary approaches:
 1) How do RNA and protein co-fold to assemble the U6 snRNP?
 2) How is the spliceosome remodeled during creation of its active site?
 3) How do regulatory proteins promote splicing at weak 5'SS?
 4) How can we block ATPase-dependent transitions during splicing with small molecule inhibitors?
 5) How do we quantitatively analyze, compare, and integrate cryo-EM structures of spliceosomes?"

Recent evidence has emerged that microbes resident in the human intestine represent a key transmissible
environmental factor contributing to a number of human diseases. However, mechanisms by which gut
microbial-derived factors signal to the host to promote these diseases are largely unknown. We have recently
discovered a metaorganismal pathway where nutrients present in high fat foods (phosphatidylcholine, choline,
and L- carnitine) can be metabolized by the gut microbial enzymes to generate trimethylamine (TMA), which is
then further metabolized by the host enzyme flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) to produce
trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Here we show that pharmacologic inhibition of the gut microbial choline TMA
lyase enzyme CutC/D protects mice against alcoholic liver disease. Unexpectedly, this protection is associated
with reorganization of the host circadian clock. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Testing the hypothesis that
alcohol-induced circadian disruption depends on gut microbial TMA production, and that TMA lyase inhibitors
represent a gut microbe-targeted chronotherapy; and Aim 2. Testing the hypothesis that the microbe-derived
metabolite TMA activates the host G protein-coupled receptor trace amine-associated receptor 5 (TAAR5) to
Promote Ethanol-Driven Sarcopenia. These studies will be significant because they have the potential to
uncover the first ever described diet-microbe-derived zeitgeber. Successful completion of this project will be
transformative by providing proof of concept that a non- antibiotic drug targeting a specific microbial enzyme
can serve as a therapeutic strategy for alcohol-induced tissue injury."
10817870,"ABSTRACT
Eighteen million Americans abuse alcohol, with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) affecting over 10 million
people. The development of ALD is a complex process involving both parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells
in liver. The impact of ethanol on hepatocytes is characterized as a condition of “organelle stress” with multi-
factorial changes in hepatocellular function, ultimately leading to hepatocellular death, including multiple path-
ways of programmed cell death (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis). Enhanced hepatic inflam-
mation during ethanol exposure is also an important contributor to injury and there is a strong relationship be-
tween inflammation, cell death, and progression of ALD. Inflammation and cell death are both “double-edged”
swords: depending on the pathophysiologic situation, they have deleterious and/or protective functions. Hepato-
cyte death via caspase-dependent apoptosis is associated with progression of ALD. However, we discovered
that receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3), a key protein in the necroptotic pathway of programmed cell death,
drives ethanol-induced liver injury in a murine model (mALD) and that RIP3 expression is increased in liver of
ALD patients. These novel findings indicate that the RIP3-dependent signaling network is critical to the progres-
sion of ALD. Interestingly, we now find that mixed lineage kinase like (MLKL), the canonical downstream effector
of RIP3, is not involved in mALD, suggesting that non-canonical functions of RIP3 mediate mALD. We also find
that the RIP3-MLKL pathway differentially contributes to mALD vs. high-fat diet-induced liver injury (HFD). In
HFD, RIP3 does not contribute to injury. Instead, MLKL mediates injury via an inhibition of autophagy in hepato-
cytes. In order to leverage these new mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of ALD into therapeutic
strategies for treatment or prevention of ALD, we propose to 1) Leverage the differential contributions of RIP3 to
mALD and HFD models to develop circulating biomarkers to distinguish ALD and NASH in patients, 2) RIP3 is
a multifunctional protein that contains a kinase domain that phosphorylates MLKL and a RHIM domain involved
in protein-protein interactions. We will use kinase-dead and RHIM-deleted mice, as well as cell specific knock-
outs to identify the non-canonical and cell-specific mechanisms of RIP3 action in mALD and 3) Discover the
post-translational mechanisms by which ethanol disrupts the RIP3 signaling network using non-targeted prote-
omics, coupled with mouse and cell based targeted mechanistic approaches to determine if ethanol-induced
changes in phosphorylation and ubiquitination lead to dysregulation of signaling in the RIP3 network. Impact:
By understanding the regulation and interplay between inflammation and specific programmed cell death path-
ways within the hepatocellular environment, our results will inform development of therapeutic strategies for the
treatment of ALD."

The overall goal of the Northeast Ohio Alcohol Center (NOAC) is to identify specific molecular targets responsible
for ethanol-induced tissue damage, as well as to understand the complex adaptive and maladaptive responses
of cells and systems to that damage. This information will enable us to 1) target therapeutic interventions to slow
and/or reverse the progression of alcohol-induced tissue injury and 2) develop specific assays that can assess
the efficacy of novel therapeutic strategies in relevant clinical populations. The NOAC brings together an
outstanding team of interdisciplinary investigators including geneticists, cell biologists, oxidation biochemists,
biomarker experts, synthetic chemists and clinical translational investigators. A critical element to leveraging the
expertise of our team of investigators is to provide support for pilot projects. Pilot projects bring innovative and
promising new approaches to the alcohol field and facilitate collaborations between team members and outside
investigators to build onto their existing individual research programs. Pilot projects are supported by our Animal
and Cell Models Core and Clinical Core, facilitating rapid progress for investigators new to the area of alcohol
research. Importantly, the supportive intellectual environment with broad expertise in biomedical and clinical
investigations will allow for the continued development of novel and innovative pilot projects. Therefore, support
for pilot projects will likely have a large impact on the progress of research on mechanisms and treatments for
ethanol-induced tissue injury. The Specific Aims of the Pilot Projects Core are to 1) Advertise the availability
of Pilot Projects and invite pilot projects from faculty at Cleveland Clinic, Case Western Reserve University,
MetroHealth Medical Center, Northeast Ohio College of Medicine and National Children’s Hospital, organize
their review and ranking, 2) Provide support for junior investigators in implementing their proposals and 3)
Monitor progress of Pilot Projects on a yearly basis. Implementation of the Pilot Projects Core will allow for
funding of novel and innovative hypotheses with a rapid turnaround from conceptualization to actualization,
facilitate collaborations between basic and clinical investigators and provide seed money to test exciting new
approaches to understanding pathophysiology of ethanol-induced tissue injury, as well as development of
biomarkers for disease progression and susceptibility. Importantly, the Pilot Projects Core will also extend the
numbers of participating investigators in the NOAC and continue to build a community able and willing to conduct
cutting edge basic and clinical alcohol-related research."

The overall goal of the Northern Ohio Alcohol Center (NOAC) is to identify specific molecular targets of ethanol-
induced damage, as well as understand the complex adaptive and maladaptive responses of cells and systems
to that injury. This information will enable us to 1) target therapeutic interventions that will either slow and/or
reverse the progression of alcohol-induced tissue injury and 2) develop specific assays that can assess the
efficacy of novel therapeutic strategies in relevant clinical populations. NOAC brings together an outstanding
team of interdisciplinary investigators. Progress by these investigators into the mechanisms of ethanol-induced
tissue injury is supported by the Animal Models and Cell Isolation Core (Animal/Cell Core). The use of
standardized protocols for in vivo models of acute and chronic ethanol exposure to rodents, as well as the use
of in vitro primary cell cultures isolated from ethanol-exposed animals, is critical to understanding the molecular
mechanisms for the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced tissue injury. The purpose of the Animal/Cell Core is to
provide expertise in the design and implementation of experiments investigating alcohol-induced tissue injury,
as well as standardized protocols and centralized facilities for the exposure of rodents to ethanol, as well as
isolation of hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells from the liver. The Core provides support for Research
Components and Pilot Projects supported by NOAC, as well as additional projects funded by NIAAA and other
sources to local investigators, as well as investigators nationally and internationally. Personnel experienced in
working with rat and murine models of acute and chronic ethanol exposure, as well as isolating parenchymal
and non-parenchymal cells from rodents, staff the Animal/Cell Core. The proposed Research Components and
Pilot Projects will make use of the Animal/Cell Core. The major goal of the Animal/Cell Core will be to make
tissue and cellular samples from control and ethanol-exposed animals available to members of NOAC. The
procedures involved are complex and expensive; the availability of centralized facilities will allow rapid access
of investigators in NOAC, as well as investigators new to alcohol research, to the tissues and cells needed to
test novel and innovative hypotheses without the delay of each PI developing these techniques in each of their
own laboratories. The Animal/Cell Core also maintains an extensive biorepository of tissues and cells from
ethanol-exposed mice and rats. This biorepository allows for considerable cost savings that result from the
shared use of samples between the different members of NOAC. Importantly, the shared use of samples is also
leveraged to integrate data from multiple investigators to better understand interactions between cells, tissues
and systems in response to ethanol. The combination of our outstanding investigative team and excellent Core
resources will lead to key discoveries on mechanisms of alcohol-induced tissue injury and lead to the
development of efficacious treatment strategies."

The availability of biological samples from individuals with alcoholic liver disease (ALD), as well as samples from
appropriate heavy drinking, yet healthy controls and non-drinking healthy controls, is an essential first step in the
translation of basic research advances to the clinic. The purpose of the Clinical Core component of the P50
Northern Ohio Alcohol Center (NOAC) is to provide biological samples (plasma/serum, urine, feces, DNA and
peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs]) from patients with different stages of alcoholic liver disease, as
well as healthy control subjects, to members of the NOAC. These samples can then be used to test specific
hypotheses related to the presence of specific circulating biomarkers, functional immune activity in PBMCs
and/or genetic polymorphisms that may predict severity of disease, short- and long-term morbidity and mortality
and/or responsivity to specific therapeutic interventions commonly used in clinical practice. The Clinical Core is
comprised of two components, building on the established biorepositories and the diversity of outstanding clinical
expertise at the Cleveland Clinic and MetroHealth Medical Center: 1) NOAC biorepository: This biorepository
included clinical samples (plasma, serum, PBMC, DNA, feces and urine), as well as clinical and demographic
data from liver disease patients and healthy controls and 2) CoPath Database/Biospecimen Repository: The
CoPath Database/Biospecimen Repository at the Cleveland Clinic allows investigators access to archived biopsy
materials, with associated clinical data, initially used for diagnostic purposes. A Pathologist specializing in liver
disease provides expertise in the analysis and interpretation of histological and immunohistochemical analysis
of biopsy samples. The NOAC now has a robust biorepository including clinical and demographic data from
patients with alcoholic hepatitis (n=93) and alcoholic cirrhosis (n=19), as well as NASH patients (n=26). Both
lean and obese healthy controls (n=45) have been recruited. In the renewal application, the Clinical Core will
be responsible for continuing to build the NOAC biorepository via subject recruitment and communication, clinical
specimen collection, subject characterization through clinical data acquisition and subject follow-up. We are
currently recruiting from both CCF and MetroHealth Medical Center, with MetroHealth providing better access to
patients from minority populations, as well as heavy drinkers without disease. The Clinical Core will interact
intimately with the members of the NOAC to ensure distribution of clinical samples and data to Center
investigators. In this capacity, the Clinical Core will function as a collective resource to the membership of the
NOAC to support accomplishment of its major goal of facilitating the translation of novel findings in the
basic mechanisms of ethanol action to clinical studies. This Core will promote interaction between Research
Components/Pilot Projects, ensuring that valuable clinical samples are utilized to their fullest possibilities."
10865074,"Abstract
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) lists over 300 “chemicals of concern.” These chemicals
relate to the Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standard (CFATS). The chemicals on this list were provided by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the international Chemical Weapons Convention, and the
Department of Transportation (DOT). A large number of the chemicals on the DHS list are strong oxidizers.
Since the eye is exposed and vulnerable to irreversible damage by strong oxidizers, which may permanently
damage the eye or even cause loss of vision, developing a countermeasure for accidental or malicious ocular
exposure to strong oxidizers is a high priority. The goal of the proposed research is to develop an eye wash
solution containing antioxidants to mitigate damage to the eye caused by strongly oxidative chemical threats.
To preliminarily test the hypothesis that damage induced by oxidative chemicals can be mitigated by a higher
than physiological concentration of a tear antioxidant, we added a tear antioxidant to a 30-minute eye wash
protocol as a treatment for ocular exposure to the strong oxidant chemical hypochlorite. Exposure of the eye to
8.25% hypochlorite followed by washing with saline alone resulted in significant loss of viable cells. However,
when an antioxidant was added to the saline wash solution at 10× its physiological human tear concentration,
eye damage was markedly reduced.
The specific aims will answer the following questions: What is the optimal eye wash protocol and
antioxidant concentration that will mitigate damage? Can preliminary results be further supported and the
mechanism(s) of action better understood by the analysis of additional biochemical measurements including
cell death and lipid and protein oxidation? Is the loss of viability induced by at least three other strong oxidant
chemicals on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)’s list of chemicals of concern also mitigated by
washing with an antioxidant formulation? To answer these questions, the specific aims will rigorously test the
hypothesis that postexposure washing with antioxidants can reduce loss of viability to the cornea. We will also
test the hypothesis that the antioxidant directly decreases oxidation induced by oxidative corrosives before
they damage a large percentage of the stroma using representative lipid and protein oxidation assays; if there
is no clear relationship between the antioxidant and a reduction in lipid and protein oxidation, alternative cell-
based studies will be used to evaluate the effects of the antioxidant on cell growth and differentiation in this
context. We will also test the hypothesis that the mitigation of damage by the antioxidant is generalizable to
other oxidants.
We anticipate that the following outcomes will be achieved: 1) The unequivocal demonstration of less loss of
viability of the cornea from levels that corrode to levels that are fully reversible within 21 days by washing with
a solution containing antioxidants after hypochlorite-induced damage. 2) Confirmation that the mechanism of
action responsible for the reduced loss of viability is the inactivation of strong oxidants as they corrode ocular
tissue with time, or, as determined by alternative strategies, that washing with antioxidants improves viability
after strong oxidant exposure. 3) Demonstration that an antioxidant eye wash countermeasure can be used for
other strong oxidants on the DHS list of chemicals of concern. These outcomes may establish that tear-related
antioxidants at high concentrations can reduce eye damage caused by strong oxidizing chemicals on the DHS
list of chemicals of concern.
By demonstrating that high concentrations of naturally occurring tear antioxidants can mitigate eye damage,
the proposed exploratory research will increase our understanding of the potential use of antioxidants to
reduce eye damage after accidental exposure to or attack with strong oxidant chemicals.

10825526,"Epithelial cells are polarized in two axes for their function, ubiquitous apical-basal polarity and a second axis
within the epithelial plane, called Planar Cell Polarity (PCP). Cell polarity and associated ordered cellular
arrangements and patterning during organogenesis and homeostasis depend on Wnt-signaling mediated PCP
mechanisms. Classical examples of PCP organized tissues include in Drosophila adult cuticular structures, like
the wing and thorax epithelia, and in mammals striking aspects of PCP are evident in the skin, the inner ear
epithelium, or the respiratory system and most other internal organs. Moreover, convergent extension
processes during gastrulation and neural tube closure require Wnt/PCP signaling. Similarly, the PCP pathway
is linked to the regulation of asymmetric cell divisions in stem cells of many organs. Studies of PCP
establishment in Drosophila continue to serve as a paradigm to unravel this type of polarity in development and
human disease. PCP is coordinated by Wnt ligand signals, resulting in asymmetric localization of their
receptors, the Frizzled (Fz) proteins, and associated signaling cascade. Core Wnt-Fz/PCP factors are required
to interpret polarity within the cell and relay this to neighboring cells. All core PCP members are evolutionarily
conserved and regulate all PCP aspects studied. This Wnt-pathway is distinct from canonical Wnt-Fz/β-catenin
signaling (and correct regulation of signaling specificity between the two Wnt-pathways, activated by the same
receptor(s), is critical for development and disease). The cellular mechanism(s) affecting polarity downstream
of either Fz or Vang (Vangl1/2 in mammals), with Vang/Vangl being the intercellular transmembrane PCP-
partners of Fz proteins, remain poorly understood. The focus of my lab’s research, and this application, is to (i)
continue to investigate the mechanistic interactions of the core PCP signaling factors and the resulting cellular
read-outs and intracellular responses, (ii) to establish connections between the core Fz/PCP pathway and the
Fat/Ds-PCP cassette, and (iii) – a recent addition to our efforts - to dissect the non-ciliary function(s) of ciliary
proteins in both, canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling and Wnt/PCP pathways, with the advantage of being able
to do so in non-ciliated Drosophila cells. This recent focus originates from genetic screens, identifying such
non-ciliary functions of cilia associated factors. Exciting ongoing experiments are addressing the physiological
significance of regulatory interactions between the Fz- and Vang-complexes, and how these affect either Fz or
Vang cytoplasmic effectors and their cell biological responses to PCP signaling, including effects on cell
adhesion and tissue fluidity, or its impact on cytoskeletal regulation. Another major focus is based on our
identification of the Kinesin-2/IFT-A complex being required for the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. We are
continuing our mechanistic dissection of this exciting and unexpected microtubule associated process.
Information acquired here will advance our fundamental understanding of cellular polarization and the role of
ciliary proteins in either Wnt-signaling pathway, and also provide insight into Wnt-signaling disease contexts."
10875380,"We propose to test the malleability of a promising, cognitive factor that predicts alcohol misuse—drinking
identity (a facet of the self-concept linked to alcohol and drinking)—and its subsequent effect on drinking during
key transitions that occur during emerging adulthood (the developmental period from 18-25). This period is
associated with changes in risk for alcohol misuse (e.g., heavy alcohol consumption and experiencing negative
alcohol-related consequences), which has substantial individual and public health costs. Changes in risk for
alcohol misuse coincide with two major life transitions experienced by a substantial proportion of the
population: graduating high school and graduating college. On average, the risk for alcohol misuse increases
after high school and decreases after college, though there is considerable heterogeneity in these trends.
When considering novel cognitive targets for intervention efforts, emerging adulthood is also a time of self-
exploration and self-concept and identity changes, suggesting that identity-based factors may be particularly
relevant. Our labs have been at the forefront of research evaluating identity and drinking. We have
demonstrated that drinking identity is a unique cognitive predictor of alcohol misuse and that changes in
drinking identity are associated with changes in drinking in the early college years and during the transition out
of college. Key next steps involve the validation of strategies for shifting drinking identity to prevent the typical
escalation of alcohol misuse associated with the transition out of high school and expedite reductions in
alcohol misuse associated with the transition out of college. An extensive psychology literature on the self-
concept, identity motivation, possible selves, and self-regulation provides a strong theoretical foundation for
adapting a future possible selves task to shift drinking identity and, in turn, reduce alcohol misuse. Our
overarching aims are to evaluate changes in drinking identity in response to the future possible selves task, to
demonstrate that those changes are, in turn, followed by changes in alcohol misuse and key risk factors, and
to establish boundary conditions for these changes—e.g., their durability, the most effective task version, and
the need for multiple (vs. single) task doses. We propose to conduct two experimental studies (Study 1: high
school transition; Study 2: college transition) that will be implemented at two demographically diverse sites (N
= 528 per study; n = 264 per study site). We will use a 2 (imagine and write about a future possible desired self
vs. not) x 2 (imagine and write about a future possible feared self vs. not) x 2 (1 vs. 3 writing session[s])
design. The effects of the future possible selves task on drinking identity, risk factors, and alcohol misuse will
be evaluated out to 12 months. Our approach provides a robust test of the task’s efficacy as an alcohol misuse
prevention [Study 1] and intervention [Study 2] strategy. If successful, this application will support drinking
identity as a malleable cognitive factor underlying alcohol misuse and present a novel, scalable, theory-based
strategy to address alcohol misuse during key developmental transitions in emerging adulthood."
10837762,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a heterogenous syndrome of cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. As
much as 40% of MCI patients have comorbid depression, which can significantly increase risk for dementia. We
propose that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), an FDA-approved treatment for depression,
may be a promising treatment to prevent dementia in MCI. By stimulating shared neurocircuitry implicated in
both affective and cognitive control, prior work has shown that conventional rTMS to left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (l-dlPFC) improves both affective and cognitive symptoms in various neuropsychiatric syndromes. Thus,
our main hypothesis is that excitatory rTMS to the l-dlPFC, which is hypoactive in MCI, may simultaneously
ameliorate depression and bolster cognitive abilities, potentially preventing dementia incidence. To test this
hypothesis, we first need to address a critical gap which is to resolve the functional form of the dose-response
curve to identify the optimal dose for symptom remediation. This has yet to be established for accelerated, high-
dose intermittent theta burst (iTBS)-rTMS, which reduces the conventional rTMS treatment course by >50%. We
present Preliminary Data from two open-label phase I trials that support the safety, feasibility, and acceptability
of iTBS-rTMS to l-dlPFC in patients with amnestic MCI due to AD or Vascular Cognitive Impairment due to stroke.
While these trials were not explicitly dosed for efficacy, we found large effect size improvements in fluid cognition
in both groups. We therefore propose to conduct a double-blind, randomized sham-controlled, parallel group,
dose-ranging phase II trial, where 60 participants will be recruited to undergo 6 treatment days within a span of
2 weeks. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 6 dose-step combinations of active/sham iTBS-rTMS, ranging
from 0 active pulses (all sham; dose step 1) to 36,000 total active pulses (all active; dose step 6). Site targeting
will be highly individualized using innovative fMRI methods. Participants who have MCI due to AD and/or cerebro-
vascular disease with at least moderate depression will be recruited using rigorous diagnostic and psychometric
criteria. All will undergo clinical assessments and brain MRI at pre-treatment and at 1-week post-treatment, and
clinical assessments at 8-weeks and 6-months post-treatment. We will use established primary outcomes and
supplement these with psychometrically robust secondary outcomes. As a team with collective expertise in
rTMS, MCI, neuropsychology, affective neuroscience, and clinical trials biostatistics, we seek to establish the
dose-response curves for reduced depression (Aim 1) and improved cognition (Aim 2) following iTBS-rTMS. We
also seek to examine alterations in functional connectivity following treatment as an Exploratory Aim. This trial
will pave the way for subsequent randomized controlled trials to optimize therapeutic delivery, including
variations in sites beyond dlPFC, indications such as other prodromal states or symptom presentations, and
combinatorial designs where behavioral interventions provide potent adjuncts to rTMS-induced neuroplasticity."

The partnership center, entitled Partnership to Assess Viral and Immune Landscape Intersections with Oncology
(PAVILION) for People Living with HIV Program will bring together experienced research sites and world-
renowned HIV, human papillomavirus (HPV), Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), and cancer researchers to offer a novel
contribution to the HIV-Associated Malignancies Research Center network. The PAVILION theme is research
of understudied, virus-associated tumors that disproportionately impact men and women living with HIV
in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). SSA remains home to two thirds of people living with HIV (PLWH). HIV-related
immunosuppression results in an inability to control viruses and therefore a higher risk of virus-associated
cancer, even among PLWH on effective antiretroviral therapy. The increasing life-expectancy of PLWH
compounds this cancer risk as cancer is now a leading cause of mortality among PLWH in both high and low
resource countries. Furthermore, PLWH experience poorer cancer treatment outcomes. Despite this, few studies
of cancer etiology and cancer outcomes among PLWH in LMICs have been conducted, with little focus on HPV
cancers at extra-cervical anatomic sites and very few studies of a suspected viral etiology for conjunctival tumors.
PAVILION will therefore focus on the full range of cancers caused by HPV (anal, cervical, oropharyngeal, penile,
and vulvar cancers) and the potential role of EBV in conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma - cancers that are
disproportionality higher among PLWH, and which result in substantial morbidity and mortality.
The overall goal of PAVILION is to provide the data necessary to inform prevention and therapeutic strategies
to reduce the burden of cancers among PLWH in SSA. PAVILION includes partners in South Africa and
Zimbabwe, multiple institutions in the US, and the DKFZ in Germany. Notably, Zimbabwe and South Africa have
among the highest prevalence of HIV in Africa and have a rapidly increasing cancer burden that is largely
comprised of infection-associated cancers. As a partnership, we have long standing collaborations, outstanding
research leadership, mutual prioritization of the cancers to study, and institutional and consortium experience
that will facilitate translation of scientific findings to achieve our goal. Specific Aims supporting this goal are:
Aim 1: Establish a multi-national partnership with research infrastructure (Administrative & Coordinating,
Central Laboratory, and Data Management & Statistics Cores) to conduct collaborative, innovative, and
impactful research that advances prevention and treatment of infection-related cancers among PLWH in SSA
Aim 2: Understand the fraction of tumors attributable to specific oncogenic viruses (i.e., HPV, EBV), the
characterization of the immune microenvironment of tumors unique to the setting of HIV, and a more complete
understanding of clinical outcomes for PLWH and cancer in SSA (Projects 1 and 2)
Aim 3: Build capacity through active mentorship and training programs (Administrative & Coordinating and
Developmental Cores) for early stage and junior faculty at partnership institutions"

Sepsis is a major global health problem – my previous work has estimated that there were nearly 50 million
cases and 11 million associated deaths worldwide in 2017, representing 20% of all deaths that year. While
sepsis is a public health challenge in nearly every location in world, there is strong evidence that certain
subgroups are at far higher risk than others, with higher incidence among older adults, people with
multimorbidity, and those in communities with lower healthcare access and quality. In the United States (US),
these risk factors are closely linked and geographically clustered. My overall objective in this proposal is to
improve understanding of the factors influencing individual sepsis risk, accounting for community-
level features and personal health history over time, to establish critical new insights into sepsis
prevention. My central hypothesis is that there is a syndemic of sepsis, multimorbidity, aging, and low
healthcare access and quality in the US that is spatially patterned. Syndemics, population-level clustering of
social and health problems in which the clustering results in adverse disease interaction, provide a “framework
of disease-disease and social condition-disease interactions” that can improve understanding of health
conditions within a specific population. To test my hypothesis I will leverage, and spatially link for the first time,
multiple unique data sources including individual electronic health records, Census data, community data
sources, and statewide health systems data. I will combine these data sources through a community-informed
model, building upon the Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics (FRED) agent-based
modeling platform. Using the syndemic framework, I will test my central hypothesis via three specific aims: 1)
evaluate spatial, social, and health systems-based patterns of incident sepsis hospitalizations among adults in
Allegheny County, Pennsylvania over an 8-year period using multilevel models that geographically link
electronic health records, Census data, and community data sources at the ZIP code level, 2) apply a
syndemic framework within the FRED agent-based modeling platform to test the mechanisms that underlie the
relationships between patient-level features of aging and multimorbidity, community factors, and health system
access and quality, that impact individual risk for incident sepsis, and 3) use community-engaged model
building with sepsis patients, families, and healthcare professionals to refine the sepsis, aging, multimorbidity,
and healthcare access and quality syndemic model. The proposed work will greatly impact US public health
policy, sepsis prevention efforts, and care for older adults with chronic conditions. Closely mentored by experts
in sepsis and quantitative modeling of social contextual features of health, this award will provide essential
research training in advanced epidemiologic methods, including multilevel modeling, agent-based modeling,
and community-engaged research. This award will support my overall career goal of becoming an independent
investigator focused on reducing the global burden of sepsis, with a strong focus on health disparities."
10784721,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The purpose of this NIH Stage 1B mixed methods study is to test the feasibility, acceptability, fidelity and
efficacy of a telehealth-based intervention designed to reduce stress for family care partners (CP) for those
with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). ADRD extracts physical, mental and financial tolls
from CPs caring for affected family members. In the later stages of disease, behavioral and psychological
symptoms of dementia (BPSD) can contribute to CP burden, increasing the risk of depression in CPs and long-
term care placement for those with ADRD. Interventions that help CPs manage BPSD are available, but
access to them is limited by cost, distance, care demands and stigma. Further, most technology-based
interventions are not tailored to the later stages of disease, when BPSD are more common. In the proposed
study we aim to refine and optimize the multi-site Tele-STELLA (Support via TEchnology: Living and Learning
with Advancing ADRD) intervention. Tele-STELLA is a video-conference-based intervention that provides
education and peer support for CPs caring for family members in the moderate to late stages of ADRD. The
intervention, which CPs access from their own homes, begins with one-to-one training with a Tele-STELLA
Guide (a nurse or psychologist), then advances to peer-based education and support modeled on the ECHO
(Extension of Community Healthcare Outcomes) template. The intervention is specifically for CPs, no care-
recipients with ADRD will be in this study. However, the skills CPs develop in Tele-STELLA will be integrated
into the care of the person with ADRD, thus reducing behavioral symptoms. The foundation of this proposal
was laid with two pilot studies which assessed early versions of Tele-STELLA. This mixed-methods study will
assess the feasibility, acceptability, treatment fidelity and efficacy of Tele-STELLA. We hypothesize that the
Tele-STELLA intervention will be feasible and acceptable and will reduce the frequency of behavioral
symptoms in persons with ADRD, thus improving CP affective symptoms (burden, depression, grief) and
quality of life for CPs and those with ADRD. We will recruit rural, African American and white CPs (n=150) from
three sites (Oregon, Kentucky and Georgia). Feasibility will be assessed quantitatively by measuring
attendance and completion rates. Qualitative data from focus groups will augment the feasibility quantitative
findings and provide feedback on consumer acceptability. Content experts will evaluate treatment fidelity by
reviewing a subsample of video-taped sessions. We will measure efficacy of Tele-TELLA on reducing the
frequency of behavioral and psychological symptoms in persons with ADRD using pre-post assessments and
linear regression strategies. Our long term goal is to reduce the psychological burden CPs experience by
providing the Tele-STELLA intervention for any CP who has access to a computer and an internet connection."
10898565,"OVERALL: SUMMARY
The overall objective of the Northwestern Brain Tumor SPORE is to improve outcomes for brain tumor
patients. Of the various primary intracerebral neoplasms, glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common. GBM
patients that receive standard-of-care treatment have a median survival of 20 months, and 5-year survival is
extremely rare. Progress in developing better treatments for this lethal tumor has been disappointing. A major
contributor to this lack of therapeutic improvement is the delicate nature of the organ in which this cancer
occurs. There are significant limitations to how aggressively GBM patients can be treated surgically, and the
efficacy of systemically administered therapies are often compromised due to limited access to the brain. To
address the public health problem that is associated with glioblastoma, we have assembled a talented team of
investigators with extensive backgrounds in brain tumor research and therapy. All members of this team have
professional records indicating success in directing their own programs of research. Together, these faculty
initiated group interactions in order to bring a team science approach to bear upon the study and treatment of
GBM, and for which a multidisciplinary approach is needed for achieving meaningful progress."

(Co-I), with input from the SPORE Executive Committee, and with guidance from the Internal and External
Advisory Boards. The core leaders are accomplished brain tumor researchers, and are experts in tumor
biology, experimental therapeutics, and preclinical as well as clinical studies. As such they are well qualified to
supervise this SPORE, and see to its productivity as well as impact on treatment outcomes for brain tumor
patients. Based on committee and advisory board recommendations, the Core Directors will make final
decisions on any issues that involve the timely progression of the SPORE. Further, as core directors they will
have overall scientific and financial responsibility for this SPORE. They will disburse funds and will receive
regular accounting of the financial status of each project. Staff support for the Core will be provided by Lurie
Cancer Center (LCC) Administrator Dr. Robin Leikin, Grants and Contracts Administrator Mr. Daniel
Rademacher, Program/Advocacy Administrator Ms. Laura Jaros, and patient advocate, Mark Agnew. Through
the efforts of these individuals and activities of the Administrative Core, mechanisms will be in place and

10898617,"BIOSPECIMEN CORE: SUMMARY
 The Biospecimen Core is a vital resource that supports all brain tumor research at Northwestern, and is
especially important in seeing that all projects experience clinical translation within the period of SPORE funding.
Regular interactions with the Biostatistics & Bioinformatics Core and Administrative Core will ensure that each
project achieves its objectives, and has positive impact on the care of brain tumor patients.
 The Biospecimen Core will have extensive interactions with all projects and cores by acting as the central
repository of patient tissues and renewable tumor resources, by providing the highest quality of tissue analytical
services, and by providing neuropathological consultation. The Director of the Core, Dr. Horbinski, as well as the
Co-Director, Dr. Daniel Brat, will supervise quality control testing of banked specimens, and will perform all
microscopy-based analyses of patient tissues and tumor models for each SPORE project. Biospecimen Core
activities will be performed to accomplish the following aims:
Aim 1: Provide Northwestern brain tumor researchers with annotated biospecimens from patients.
Aim 2: Subject all biospecimens to rigorous quality control.
Aim 3: Conduct biospecimen-based independent research to study brain tumor biology and optimize the
use of clinically relevant biomarkers.
Aim 4: Support SPORE projects with biospecimens and neuropathologic analyses."
10812504,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite increased funding across the NIH enterprise over the past decade, fewer physician trainees are choosing
to pursue scientific careers, contributing to a decline in the number of physician-scientists capable of achieving
independent research success. To address the workforce needs, the Department of Psychiatry at Washington
University launched the Psychiatry Resident Research Education Program (PRREP) in 2016. Funded by NIMH’s
R25 program in 2017, PRREP is agnostic of prior research experience, is available to both our general and child
and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) training programs, and provides individualized educational planning divided
into two phases. Phase 1 aims to increase the number of incoming residents considering a research career by
enhancing recruitment and providing early education (career counseling/mentoring, didactics, seminars, on-line
coursework) and introductory research experiences. The more research-intensive Phase 2 focuses on gaining
experience in key areas, including study design, regulatory considerations, budgeting, data
collection/management, and analysis. Total time spent in hands-on research will be approximately 12 months
for a resident in the 4-year general adult program and 13 months for a CAP resident who is in training for 5 years.
During this first period of funding, our PRREP graduates have been a diverse group of individuals (10% disabled,
13% Hispanic, 13% African American, 42% female) and we have doubled the number of graduates pursuing
research careers (50% with a Ph.D.). Our PRREP trainees have been listed as an author on manuscripts 101
times. In this renewal application we seek on-going support from NIMH’s R25 program to expand on the early
successes we have achieved with this critical program, building upon the solid foundation we have established
in these first 4 years. In this renewal application, we propose to continue to recruit promising trainees into
PRREP, providing early and focused mentorship and hands-on research experiences to promote development
of skills and knowledge necessary for successful transition to Phase 2. To build upon the success achieved
during the initial funding period, we will focus on the following goals: 1) we will target recruitment of individuals
interested in CAP research careers, provide early exposure to CAP faculty and enhance the mentorship of
trainees interested in CAP; 2) utilizing institutional training and support resources, we will promote excellence in
mentorship by providing mentors feedback throughout the academic year, and provide mentorship training and
support for early-career faculty with emerging mentoring skills; and 3) informed by the initial 4 years of funding,
we will develop, implement and track educational milestones targeting research skills needed to become a
successful principal investigator. Funding for the next 5 years will provide us with the means to build on this solid
foundation to continue providing innovative and inclusive research training for the next generation of physician-
scientists in psychiatry."
10909809,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this project is to increase an understanding of substance use, how it impacts HIV care, and how to
address it in a critical population, female sex workers (FSW) aged 18 years and older, in South Africa (SA), using
data and infrastructure from an ongoing adaptive intervention, the Siyaphambili trial. Mathematical models
suggest that nearly half of the 200,000 annual HIV infections among adults in SA are acquired by FSW, their
clients, or partners of their clients and thus treating these unmet needs could result in better health outcomes for
women and the population as a whole. Specific Aim 1: Characterize substance use among the FSW living with
HIV who participated in the Siyaphambili trial, with a focus on identifying temporal patterns of polysubstance use,
using Latent Transition Analysis (LTA), their associated determinants (e.g., violence, stigma, economic
vulnerability), and if they modify the effectiveness of the sequentially adaptive strategy to improve HIV care
outcomes. Specific Aim 2: Conduct mixed methods formative research on how to deliver substance use
treatment for FSW in the context of HIV care through semi-structured interviews with 200 FSW engaged in the
Siyaphambili study or in the TB HIV Care (THC) treatment and prevention sex worker program who report any
illicit drug use, to ascertain experiences with substances, treatment (e.g. types, relapse), willingness for
treatment, and preferences for treatment using a discrete choice experiment. This data will be supplemented by
in-depth interviews with 10 implementation partners (e.g., nurses, clinic management) recruited through our
partnership with THC. Specific Aim 3: Organize an Implementation Development Workgroup to initiate crosstalk
with domestic and international collaborators on substance in FSW to refine emergent implementation strategies
for evaluation across contexts. This R21 will allow an additional focus on substance use in the Siyaphambili trial,
including bringing on the additional content and methodological expertise needed to achieve the proposed aims.
We will also collect primary data to inform the development and implementation of interventions that address
substance use among FSW in the context of HIV care, as well as conduct activities that strengthen international
collaborations working toward this end. The proposed R21 is aligned with multiple NIH OAR priorities, including
reducing HIV incidence (through optimized treatment), has a high likelihood of success by leveraging an existing
cohort, and will directly inform an R01 study on the implementation of substance use treatment and HIV care
among this key population."
10837722,"SUMMARY
 Transitional metals (e.g., Fe, Zn, Mn) are required by bacteria in order to grow. As such, mammals have a
variety of mechanisms to sequester these metals during infection, effectively limiting their availability for use by
bacteria (referred to as nutritional immunity). Yersinia pestis, which causes the human disease plague, needed
to evolve high-affinity metal acquisition mechanisms to overcome nutritional immunity and colonize its hosts.
Because these mechanisms are key to Y. pestis virulence, they represent potential therapeutic targets for the
treatment or prevention of plague. Therefore, our long term goals are to identify the mechanisms used by Y.
pestis to evade host nutritional immunity and define their roles in virulence. Recently, we have made the exciting
discovery that yersiniabactin (Ybt), a siderophore essential for Y. pestis iron (Fe) acquisition, is also able to bind
to zinc (Zn), and contributes to Zn acquisition in vitro. Furthermore, using a hemochromatosis mouse model that
is defective in Fe-mediated nutritional immunity, we demonstrated for the first time that Ybt contributes to
virulence in an Fe-independent manner. Using a Y. pestis mutant defective in Zn acquisition, was also showed
that the host protein calprotectin, which is a key component to Zn-mediated nutritional immunity, is a barrier to
Y. pestis infection, and Ybt contributes to overcoming this barrier in both pneumonic and bubonic plague.
Together, these data are our premise for the conceptually innovative hypothesis that Ybt not only contributes to
virulence through Fe acquisition, but also contributes to Zn acquisition, which aids in overcoming calprotectin
mediated nutritional immunity. In this proposal, we will build on these exciting discoveries. In Aim 1, we will define
the mechanisms that govern metal selectivity of Ybt and the re-acquisition of Ybt-Zn by the bacterium. In Aim 2,
we will define the Ybt secretion mechanisms used by Y. pestis and determine the therapeutic potential of
inhibiting these secretion systems during plague. Finally, in Aim 3, we will define the role of host calprotectin
during plague and the contribution of Ybt to the ability of Y. pestis in overcoming calprotectin mediated Zn
sequestration. Importantly, Ybt is a conserved virulence factor in many Gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, the
data generated from these studies has the potential to provide us with a broader understanding of the role of Ybt
in the virulence of multiple pathogens. Ultimately, these data will provide a foundation for the rational design of
new therapeutic approaches targeting these mechanisms to combat Y. pestis infection."
10841512,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The HIV-1 capsid (CA) is a protein that plays a major role in multiple steps of the virus life cycle. During the
previous funding cycle we solved the elusive structure of the intact native full length hexameric HIV-1 CA
revealing previously unknown molecular details, especially at the 3-fold and 2-fold intra-hexamer interfaces that
affect core stability. We also solved >45 CA structures that include mutations that modulate core stability, thus
providing the first glimpses of the molecular basis of core stabilization that is critical in designing potential
therapeutics. Additional structures were in complex with host factor peptides, or a variety of novel inhibitors. In
addition, we synthesized and characterized >220 compounds that target the PF74-binding pocket. Among them
are compounds with much higher potency than PF74, and importantly, compounds with improved resistance
profile compared to GS-6207, a highly potent CA-targeting drug in clinical trials. In addition to strong CA hexamer
stabilizers, we introduced an innovative class of compounds, “destabilizers” of CA hexamers, raising the exciting
prospect of core destabilization that may lead to premature capsid uncoating and interferon upregulation.
 We will use a combination of chemical synthesis, virological, biophysical, and crystallography approaches to
synthesize a number of compounds that improve potency through new inter- and intra-protomer interactions;
overcome GS-6207 resistance mutations; modulate core stability and upregulate interferon response; enable
interactions with CA through innovative mechanisms, including covalent crosslinking. The compounds will be
characterized and the structure activity relationship studies will be guided by X-ray crystallography, biophysical
studies (time-lapse imaging, thermal shift, assembly kinetics assays) and virological characterization of
mechanism of action as well as drug resistance studies. The research will be conducted by the groups of Stefan
Sarafianos at Emory Univ (structure, biophysics, virology) and ZQ Wang (chemical synthesis, Univ of
Minnesota), Eric Freed at DRP-NCI (virology), and in collaboration with Greg Melikian (imaging).
 The proposed studies will advance our understanding of the structural basis of core stability, which controls a
large number of steps in the virus life cycle. They will also lead to the identification of innovative compound leads
with novel “CA-destabilizing” mechanisms of action, high potency, improved resistance profiles, CA-crosslinking
functionalities, and improved pharmacological properties."
10807009,"Project Summary: Neurodegenerative disorders are a significant public health and economic problem and are
the leading cause of disability worldwide. Understanding the specific degenerative processes that are actively
progressing over the course of the illness is crucial for developing targeted drugs therapies and deciding
treatment options. Additionally, understanding the structural connectivity changes to tease apart the specific
circuitry affected is crucial in developing circuit specific non-invasive brain stimulation therapies. Diffusion-
based MRI assays can provide microstructural measures that are highly sensitive to (i) the neurodegenerative
processes and (ii) connectivity changes. Advanced modeling approaches can be utilized to further enhance the
specificity of the microstructural measures to the underlying neurodegenerative processes. However, their
utility is often limited to pure white matter regions. At the typical spatial resolution of diffusion MRI (~2mm
isotropic voxel size), significant partial volume effects exist in most brain voxels (e.g., voxels with multiple
tissue types, heterogenous fibers with different properties). In whole brain studies, this compromises the
specificity of the disease processes identified by the advanced modeling approaches; it also contributes to
inaccurate connectivity mapping. Additionally, the diffusion parameter encoding space is currently limited to
one or two shells of low b-values (b<2000s/mm2), which limits the unique determination of several relevant
microstructural parameters. The main objective of the proposal is the development, validation and clinical
translation of a diffusion MRI assay that enable efficient encoding of diffusion parameter space at sub-
millimeter voxel resolution for joint microstructure and connectivity mapping in the whole brain. Our overall
hypothesis is that the proposed framework can significantly improve the validity of microstructural modeling in
most brain voxels. The proposed development will make use of SNR-efficient 3D multi-slab acquisitions.
Coupled with time-efficient sparse k-q sampling, the encoding will span over multiple b-shells. To allow the
unique determination of several relevant microstructural parameters, multicompartmental T2 information will be
utilized. The proposed developments will be enabled by two advanced reconstruction methods: structured low-
rank matrix completion, a novel integrative framework for MRI reconstructions that enables several capabilities
including multi-echo imaging and self-calibrating reconstruction; and model-based deep learning, a novel deep
architecture to solve MR reconstruction algorithms using neural networks in a systematic fashion. These
methods overcome several inefficiencies associated with extending the 3D multi-slab acquisition for multi-
dimensional imaging in the k-q-TE space. To ensure scientific rigor, we will comprehensively validate our
technology on dedicated diffusion phantoms along with healthy volunteers using different quantification
metrics. We also validate the capability of the dMRI assay using a multi-modal MRI study in a cross-sectional
study on a cohort of Huntington's disease."
10834102,"More than 55,000 people living with HIV (PLH) in the US live in rural areas, and more than 2,300 rural
residents are diagnosed with HIV each year. PLH who live in rural areas have higher mortality rates compared
with non-rural PLH. Rural PLH are diagnosed with HIV at a more advanced stage than non-rural individuals
and present for medical care later, making them more likely to face comorbidities and need complex medical
care. Rural PLH are also less likely than their urban counterparts to remain engaged in HIV care and to be
virally suppressed. Compared with younger PLH, older PLH may face additional challenges to maintaining their
health and wellbeing, and older PLH who also live in rural areas face the doubly challenging prospect of
maintaining adherence to HIV care and managing medical conditions while living in a rural environment. Few
interventions aimed at increasing viral suppression and improving health-related quality of life (HRQOL) exist
for rural older PLH. Our previous qualitative and survey research with rural older PLH nationwide (N = 476)
identified low social support, HIV-related stigma, self-efficacy, and structural barriers (such as difficulties with
housing, food access, transportation, and insurance) as key predictors of engagement in HIV care, viral
suppression, and HRQOL for this population. Based on this, we previously piloted two remotely-delivered
interventions for rural older PLH: supportive-expressive peer social support groups and strengths-based case
management. The pilot with older PLH in the rural Southern U.S. found the interventions to be feasible,
acceptable, and to show evidence of preliminary impact. Based on this work, we propose a full-scale trial to
evaluate the efficacy of these two interventions. We will recruit 352 rural older PLH in the Southern U.S.—
including in the states prioritized in the US HHS’ “Ending the HIV Epidemic” (EtHE) plan—through partnerships
with community agencies and online advertisements. Following baseline surveys (completed online, by mail, or
by phone) and HIV viral load testing (via self-collected dried blood spot samples), participants will be
randomized to receive or not receive each intervention in a 2x2 factorial design. Follow-up surveys will occur at
4, 8, and 12 months, and viral load testing at 4 and 12 months. Surveys will assess medication adherence,
depressive symptoms, HRQOL, covariates, and potential mediators (e.g., social support, HIV stigma, self-
efficacy, structural barriers). Primary outcomes are viral suppression, antiretroviral therapy adherence,
depressive symptoms and HRQOL, and secondary outcomes are potential mediating mechanisms. We
hypothesize that both interventions will increase the proportion of participants that have viral suppression,
levels of antiretroviral therapy adherence, and HRQOL and decrease depressive symptoms. Exploratory
analyses will evaluate mediators and moderators of intervention effects. We will also assess the acceptability,
feasibility, and costs of intervention delivery. Results from this study will provide us with tools to improve health
outcomes for rural older PLH and to advance the EtHE plan to eliminate HIV transmission in the U.S."
10846801,"Project Summary
 Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanism of a class of protein molecules in cell membranes,
which enable ions to flow in or out of cells and thereby generate vital cellular electric signals. The knowledge
regarding the mechanisms of these proteins, called ion channels, form the essential scientific basis for us to
pursue the pathogenic mechanisms of certain disease processes and to develop therapies. Generally, the
functions of channels are regulated by specific signaling processes, and what underlie these regulations are
protein-conformational changes. The goal of this proposal is to further develop a fluorescence-polarization
microscopy method to accurately track in three-dimensions (3D) a fluorophore attached to a protein on an
angstrom-and-millisecond scale, and to apply this method to the investigation of conformational dynamics of
the bacterial Trk channel, which is a new target to combat certain antibiotics-resistant enterobacteria.
 Structural biology has yielded abundant protein structures. However, a full understanding of a protein
molecule must include both its spatial and temporal features. We thus need to go beyond studying a protein's
static structures on an atomic scale and study its dynamics on angstrom-and-millisecond scales. Thus far, the
experimental information about protein dynamics is often lacking, due to the absence of relatively general
methods for reliably tracking rapid angstrom-scale conformational changes of a protein. Typically, such small
changes can be reliably and quantitatively resolved only with structural techniques such as crystallography or
Cryo-EM, which, unfortunately, lack time resolution. Light microscopy may be time-resolved but its spatial
resolution had remained generally too low to resolve angstrom-scale protein conformational changes.
 Recently, we have successfully resolved protein conformational changes occurring on millisecond-and-
angstrom scales by examining emission polarization of a fluorophore attached to a protein under examination.
With a state-of-the-art fluorescence-polarization microscope and an analytic package that we put together, we
have achieved an effective angle resolution of 5-10°. Over this range, a rotational motion of a protein molecule
of an average size would cause a 1.7 - 3.5 Å change in the chord distance. Here, we will continue to develop
this method and demonstrate its applicability beyond the molecule used to develop the method, besides
acquiring important knowledge in biomedical science. With this method, we will determine the energetics and
kinetics of the protein-conformational changes underling the Trk channel's function. Integrating the resulting
dynamic information with available structural information will yield a mechanistic spatiotemporal 4D model that
accounts for the channel's behaviors on millisecond-and-angstrom scales. Success of our study will transform
the way that we investigate the dynamic mechanisms of proteins, and accelerate the transition from the
current, mostly static approach of experimental structural biology to an integrative dynamic approach."
10843119,"Long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAODs) are a heterogenous group of disorders characterized by
the inability to break down long-chain fatty acids in the mitochondria for energy. Peroxisomal fatty acid
oxidation (FAO) is a parallel pathway to mitochondrial FAO that could be leveraged to alleviate fatty acid
accumulation in patients with LC-FAODs. However, there is currently no pharmacological means of stimulating
peroxisomal FAO in humans. The ability to develop new peroxisome-stimulating therapies is limited by
knowledge gaps regarding the factors that regulate activity of peroxisomal FAO enzymes. Here, it is proposed
that sirtuin-5 (Sirt5) and lysine succinylation—a post-translational modification reversed by Sirt5—represent a
new mechanism for manipulating peroxisomal function. When mice are fed a class of fatty acids called
dicarboxylic acids (DCAs), lysine succinylation accumulates on peroxisomal proteins. Further preliminary data
suggest that lysine succinylation increases peroxisomal function. The capacity of Sirt5 to reverse these effects
remains unclear. The central hypothesis of this grant is that feeding DCAs can improve disease pathology in
mouse models of mitochondrial LC-FAOD by driving protein succinylation and peroxisomal activation. This is
supported by preliminary data in which seven days of DCA feeding improved muscle function in an LC-FAOD
mouse model. The central hypothesis will be fully explored in three Specific Aims. 1) Aim 1 will quantify the
effects of DCA feeding and Sirt5 ablation on the peroxisomal acylome. Sirt5 partially localizes to the
peroxisome but its activity there has not been characterized. A quantitative, site-level lysine “acylome” ± DCA
feeding will be compiled for liver, muscle, and heart—the key tissues affected in LC-FAODs—and all Sirt5
target sites identified. 2) Aim 2 is to delineate the effects of DCA feeding ± Sirt5 ablation on the function of
peroxisomal enzymes and pathway fluxes. This will be done using purified recombinant proteins, cultured cells
with manipulated Sirt5 levels in the peroxisome, and Sirt5-deficient mice. Metabolomics, 14C-substrate flux
studies, and enzyme stability/function testing will be used to determine how reversible lysine PTMs affect the
peroxisome. 3) Aim 3 will be to test DCA feeding as a therapeutic strategy in LC-FAOD mouse models. It is
proposed that DCAs will distribute beyond the liver to the peripheral organs, serving as a source of energy via
partial chain shortening and peroxisomal gain-of-function. Mild and severe LC-FAOD mouse models ± long-
term DCA feeding will be evaluated for liver, heart, and muscle functioning as well as the response to fasting
stress. Ablation of Sirt5 in this context may further enhance peroxisomal function. To test this, the LC-FAOD
mouse models will be crossed onto a Sirt5-/- background. Together, completion of these Specific Aims will form
critical new knowledge for manipulating peroxisomal function to treat LC-FAODs. These mechanisms are also
relevant to aging, kidney injury, diabetes, cancer, and many other diseases characterized by impaired
peroxisomal function and dysfunctional lipid metabolism."
10809748,"ABSTRACT
Fragility fractures (fractures) among persons with HIV (PWH) account for $99 million in excess costs each year
in the United States. Our prior research has shown a significantly higher annual rate of fractures among PWH
– most of whom are middle-aged – compared with uninfected individuals (2.0% vs 1.4%). Such fractures are
associated with increased rates of hospitalization and nursing home admissions, long-term physical disability,
social isolation, and death. Because middle-age is a time when people are most economically and socially
productive, fractures at this time of life set the stage for economic hardship and poorer health outcomes as
these individuals grow older. Highly effective methods exist for preventing fragility fractures, reducing rates by
25%-50%. However, there are no risk prediction models that reliably identify PWH at greatest risk.
The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) is the most widely used model for predicting fractures in the
general population. It incorporates demographics (age, sex, race) and key risk factors (body mass index,
previous fracture, parental fracture, current smoking, glucocorticoid use, rheumatoid arthritis, secondary
osteoporosis, and hazardous alcohol use). For settings where dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry is available,
sensitivity of FRAX can be improved by adding bone mineral density (BMD) to the algorithm. However, our
prior studies suggest that FRAX underperforms among PWH, exhibiting poor discrimination (C statistic 0.59)
and sensitivity (0.06). We believe this is because FRAX does not account for risk factors that are important to
PWH. For example, FRAX does not account for falls, hepatitis C and B viruses, substance use disorder,
multimorbidity, polypharmacy, use of other medications associated with fractures, or physiologic frailty – all of
which have been associated with fractures among PWH. Finally, FRAX does not account for antiretroviral
therapy (ART) use. Individual ART as well as ART classes have been independently associated with fracture.
Leveraging an outstanding team of collaborators and research platforms, we will develop, validate and
disseminate a Fracture Risk Assessment Calculator based on FRAX but that incorporates HIV-relevant risk
factors (FRAC-HIV) to calculate the probability of a fracture among PWH in the next year. We have extensive
experience working with the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS), the largest cohort of PWH in North
America, which will serve as our development cohort. To assess generalizability, we will externally validate the
model using electronic health record data from Yale New Haven Healthcare System and Boston Medical
Center. Our final aim sets the stage for the implementation of this predictive model via the development of a
web-based fracture risk prediction calculator, which will be directly informed by insights from providers who
care for PWH. FRAC-HIV will reconceptualize and facilitate clinical decision-making for fracture prevention in
PWH by emphasizing the role of clinically modifiable risk factors. Our findings will lay the foundation for future
intervention trials that will incorporate FRAC-HIV into clinical care algorithms to prevent fractures among PWH."

In this renewal, we continue efforts to develop agents that will make allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HCT) less toxic for patients. Our major objective is to develop strategies that target chronic graft
versus host disease (cGVHD)-related immune pathology without blocking the critical immunotherapeutic effects
of HCT. B cells have a substantiated pathobiological role in cGVHD, but distinguishing disease-mediating B cells
subsets remains elusive. Targeting only aberrant B cells is important because we have found that global
abrogation of peripheral B cells with rituximab perpetuates so-called altered immune homeostasis and cGVHD
in patients unable to recover a comprehensive B-cell compartment. In the previous funding period, we elucidated
how pathological B Cell Activating Factor (BAFF) and NOTCH2 promote aberrant B Cell Receptor (BCR)-
signaling after HCT. Based on known BCR signaling events during B cell maturation, we hypothesized that
antigen-hyperresponsive and SYK-reliant B cells can be eliminated without affecting immune homeostasis. In
preclinical studies and in the clinical trial, we showed that inhibition of the BCR-proximal protein, SYK, eliminated
aberrantly activated B cells and afforded recovery of B-cell homeostasis. We have also begun to dissect novel
mechanisms underpinning BCR hyper-responsiveness. Published evidence and our additional preliminary data,
including a single cell RNA-Seq dataset, form the solid scientific basis for this proposal and afford our current
overarching hypothesis that aberrant activation and effector function pathways in B cells can be effectively
targeted in cGVHD. In the current proposal, we address major gaps in our knowledge regarding human B-cell
programming that confer a propensity for ongoing loss of B cell tolerance in cGVHD. Our experimental approach
entails study of cGVHD patient samples in our ex vivo B-cell assay system and parallel experiments in mice
using B-cell conditional and inducible knockout mice as donors to verify molecular mechanisms. Specifically, we
will delineate molecular pathways that promote pathological B cells and determine the distinct disease-mediating
functions of cGVHD B cells. We will pursue three specific aims: 1) persistence of SYK protein after BCR
engagement, 2) the ability to block SYK and restore humoral immunity in cGVHD patients in a Phase II clinical
trial 3) molecular underpinnings of antibody and inflammatory cytokine production. We will define targetable
signaling pathways in B cell subsets that we will show have pathological B-effector cell functions in cGVHD. Our
proposal relies on a team science concept and is made possible by co-investigators on the Duke clinical trial
team (Drs. Horwitz and Rizzieri) and Duke Cancer Institute statistical group (Drs. Li and Owzar). Our group
remains at the forefront of efforts elucidating aberrant human B-cell signaling and testing small molecule
inhibitors in chronic GVHD patients."
10850960,"Project Summary: Our goal is to improve the lives of children with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), a life-
threatening birth defect where the enteric nervous system (ENS) is absent from the end of the bowel. Because
the ENS regulates most aspects of bowel function, “aganglionic” bowel that lacks ENS does not work well.
Symptoms include intractable constipation, bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, growth failure and HSCR-
associated enterocolitis (HAEC). HAEC is the most dangerous problem because in addition to bowel
inflammation, during HAEC, bacteria may move across the bowel epithelium causing sepsis that can be fatal.
Primary treatment for HSCR is pull-through surgery to remove aganglionic bowel and re-attach ENS-containing
bowel to near the anal verge. Unfortunately, ~35% of children continue to have problems after pull-through
surgery, including HAEC. One long-standing mystery is why symptom onset and severity differ so much among
children with HSCR. In particular, some children never have HAEC, but other children have repeated HAEC
episodes before and after pull-through surgery. Length of aganglionosis, genetic differences, and surgical details
undoubtedly impact HAEC risk and HSCR outcomes. The impact of non-genetic factors like diet, gut microbes
and small molecules inside the bowel have barely been investigated in HSCR or in HSCR models. Using Piebald
lethal sl/sl mice, a well-established HSCR model, we discovered a 5-fold difference in survival between two
mouse facilities. The survival difference is not related to the length of aganglionic bowel, distinct genetics, or
cause of death, and we do not perform surgery. Instead, the survival difference reflects fundamental aspects of
HSCR pathophysiology that can be altered by non-genetic factors in the environment. We hypothesized that the
5-fold survival difference occurs because sl/sl mice are fed different types of food and have different bowel
microbes at each institution. Differences in diet and gut microbes can alter small molecules within the bowel.
Many small molecules including nutrients in food and microbial metabolites impact bowel barrier function in ways
that affect sepsis risk. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that diet and microbes affect survival by swapping diets fed to
sl/sl at each institution, making germ-free mice, and performing fecal transplant into germ-free mice using stool
from each institution. New preliminary data suggest that simply changing diet markedly alters survival in sl/sl
mice. Aim 2 defines how the bowel barrier differs in sl/sl between institutions using anatomic and functional
approaches and identifies microbes that cross bowel epithelium to cause sepsis. Aim 3 defines mucosa-
associated microbes and small molecules within the bowel lumen that could affect barrier function. At the
completion of this study we will know if diet or gut microbes can be manipulated to improve survival in HSCR
models and will have defined mechanisms that alter sepsis risk. These data can then be leveraged to design
human clinical trials to improve outcomes in children with HSCR and reduce HAEC occurrence."
10862805,"Bone healing involves sequential and overlapping biological processes including inflammation, new bone
formation and remodeling. Most bone tissue engineering research to date focused on targeting bone-forming
cells such as stem cells. Emerging studies highlight the critical roles of immune cells in fracture healing.
Macrophages (M𝜙) is one of the first responders to bone defects and can be polarized into pro-inflammatory M1
and pro-regenerative M2 phenotype. Unsolved acute inflammatory phase and delayed M1 to M2 phenotype
switch often lead to long-term and chronic inflammation, resulting in delayed bone healing. To enhance bone
healing, there remains a lack of strategy that promotes desirable M𝜙 polarization at appropriate timing.
Biomaterial scaffolds have been widely used for bone tissue engineering as carriers for cell and growth factors
delivery. Recent studies also demonstrate biomaterials compositions impact immune responses, with natural
extracellular derived materials promote more pro-regenerative immune response than synthetic materials.
However, several key gaps in knowledge remain. First, previous studies were done using soft-tissue defect
models only, and how varying biomaterials compositions impact bone healing remains unknown. Second,
macroporosity is critical for bone regeneration in vivo, whereas previous work on assessing immune response
to biomaterials is limited to conventional nanoporous hydrogels. Third, previous work on the role of T cells in
bone healing is limited to a non-critical size long bone fracture model, and no scaffolds were used. T-cell
response to scaffold implant in a critical-sized cranial defect model has never been studied before. Last, previous
work only studied individual cell type (i.e. immune cell only or stem cell only), yet how biomaterials composition
modulates cell-cell crosstalk and subsequent tissue regeneration remains largely unknown.
The goal of our original R01 was to assess the potential of µRB scaffolds for enhancing stem cell-based tissue
regeneration by focusing on stem cell differentiation. The goal of this renewal R01 application is to harness µRB
scaffolds to enhance bone formation through immunomodulation by tuning biomaterial composition, which has
never been investigated before. Specifically, we propose to (1) Assess the effect of varying µRB scaffold
composition on M𝜙 polarization and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro; (2)
Investigate the effect of the varying µRB composition on MSC/M𝜙 crosstalk, and further impacts on MSC-based
bone formation and T cell response using a 3D co-culture model in vitro; and (3) Evaluate the effect of the varying
µRB scaffold composition on immune responses and bone regeneration in vivo using a mouse critical-size cranial
defect model. By working at the interface of biomaterials, immunology, bone disease and biology, stem cells,
animal models, and high dimensional single cell analyses, the proposed work will fill in the critical gap of
knowledge on the divergent immune response to macroporous scaffolds with tunable compositions and guide
optimal scaffold design to enhance critical-size cranial bone repair through immunomodulation."
10827902,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Following decades of discriminatory policies and underinvestment in affordable housing, the 1.2 million
households residing in our nation’s public housing (PH) developments often live in conditions of concentrated
poverty, unhealthy and unstable housing and community contexts, and constrained social and economic
opportunity. These social determinants of health drive substantial health disparities, with PH residents
experiencing elevated levels of mortality and morbidity across numerous health domains. In response, current
policy efforts seek to redevelop PH into mixed-income communities in order to deconcentrate poverty, create
healthier housing environments, decrease community stressors, and enhance community resources. It is
essential to delineate the repercussions of such policies on health disparities and to understand the
mechanisms underlying effects.
This project seeks to exploit a multi-arm natural experiment of PH redevelopment to evaluate whether
improving housing quality, limiting external displacement, and creating mixed-income communities improve the
physical, mental, and behavioral health of PH residents, including children, adults, and older adults. We will
further assess the social, environmental, and physiological mechanisms underlying such effects. Finally, we
will address whether effects vary across resident age, gender, and race/ethnicity.
The study will employ a rigorous mixed-methods design to follow 1068 individuals from 600 households in a
Boston PH community undergoing redevelopment. The redevelopment plan will move quasi-randomly selected
subsets of residents into new high quality PH, or displace them offsite followed by a return into new high quality
mixed-income housing. We will compare these residents to a matched control group who will remain in place.
Our interdisciplinary team will collect four waves of in-person surveys, direct environmental assessments, and
direct physiological stress measurements, as well as annual geocoded administrative data and intensive
qualitative interviews with a subset of respondents. This innovative combination of sources will provide data on
resident physical, mental and behavioral health; physiological stress; social connections and collective efficacy;
housing quality and disorder; and neighborhood crime, pollution, social problems and resources.
Intent-to-treat, difference-in-differences, and average treatment effect models will provide rigorous evidence of
how housing quality, residential displacement, and residence in mixed-income housing affect resident health.
Structural equation models and qualitative analyses will identify mechanisms underlying housing effects. Our
results, unearthing causal and dynamic processes underlying health disparities, will provide innovative new
data on social determinants of health to inform models of housing and community redevelopment in the context
of concentrated poverty."

Cells can detect external fluid flows across their surface. Such flows, and the flow signaling events they induce,
are critical for organ development, homeostasis, cancer dissemination, and host-microbe interactions, yet we
know little about how cells sense and respond to their hydrodynamic environment. This research program aims
to reveal fundamental mechanisms by which cells communicate through fluid flows. Specifically, we investigate
how cells generate and sense fluid flows, and how sensory cells respond to flow-derived signals. To generate
new fundamental knowledge about flow signaling, we use the well-established and highly tractable left-right
patterning system of zebrafish embryos. In this system, which is amenable to genetic perturbation as well as
high-resolution and quantitative imaging, a flow signal represses the expression of a key target gene, dand5, in
sensory cells. In our prior work, we discovered that Pkd1l1, a large Polycystin membrane protein, is critical for
flow-induced dand5 repression. In one aspect of our proposed work, we will test our hypothesis that Pkd1l1 is
a flow signal sensory component by determining the cell types, as well as sub-cellular site of action, in which
Pkd1l1 functions downstream of flow signals. We also investigate the functional role of mechanosensitive
domains within Pkd1l1 in flow-regulated signaling. In a second project, we address the major gap in
understanding of how flow signals are transduced within sensory cells. This work will use our optimized
CRISPR approaches to discover and validate new flow signal transduction machinery, something which will
markedly expand our understanding of the mechanisms acting downstream of sensory events to transduce
signals intracellularly. In a third project, we will use the known post-transcriptional repression of dand5 that
occurs specifically on the left side downstream of the flow signal as a model for generating new knowledge of
how sensory cells respond to flow signals. This includes determining the role of the 3’untranslated region and
how RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs act downstream of flow signals to repress gene expression. This
work will be aided by novel in vivo reporters we are developing which quantify flow signaling pathway outputs.
Overall, this research will uncover novel mechanisms by which cells communicate through flow signals. While
chemical signal transduction cascades (Hedgehog, Wnt, etc.) are widely studied, flow signaling pathways
represent a new frontier, with many fundamental principles waiting to be discovered. Our work using the highly
tractable left-right patterning system of zebrafish will reveal new principles of flow signal sensation and
transduction, as well as how cells respond to flow signals. Since aberrant flow signals occur in many disease
states, this will open new opportunities to improve human health."

Integration of HIV viral DNA into host cell genomes and establishment of stable latent infection have posed a
major obstacle for finding an HIV cure. HIV proviral expression in cell reservoirs is regulated by host epigenetic
and transcriptional mechanisms. Identification of effective approaches targeting host machineries to disrupt or
enforce HIV latency is a significant goal. BRD4 is an epigenetic reader that belongs to the bromodomain (BD)
and extra-terminal domain (ET) protein family (BET). Via the BDs, BRD4 binds to acetyl-lysine (KAc) residues
in chromatin histones and serves as a scaffolding platform for recruiting partner proteins through protein-protein
interactions (PPI) to regulate gene transcription, including HIV. Modulation of BET/BRD4 by a pan-BET inhibitor
(JQ1), which targets the classic KAc binding site in BDs, has been shown to activate HIV transcription. Recent
studies by my group and others indicate that BRD4 is functionally versatile, and its activity on gene transcription
is tailored by specific partner proteins it engages. Using structure-aided design, our studies (1, 2) have identified
a lead small molecule (ZL0580) and several analogs that are distinct from JQ1 but induce HIV transcriptional
suppression through BRD4. We demonstrate that ZL0580 induces suppression of both transcriptionally active
and latent HIV in multiple cell models, including J-Lat, CD4 T cells and myeloid cells/microglia. Docking analyses
of binding modes and mechanistic investigations indicate that unlike JQ1, ZL0580 targets a distinct new region
of BRD4 BD1 for binding [non-acetyl-lysine (KAc) site] and induces HIV transcriptional suppression by inhibiting
Tat transactivation and by inducing a repressive chromatin structure at the HIV LTR. Based on these novel
findings, our central hypothesis is that host BRD4 and its associated epigenetic machinery can be modulated
to repress HIV, leading to enforced HIV latency. Other than ZL0580, our ongoing research has identified another
analog (YL0255) that is structurally close to ZL0580 and induces stronger HIV suppression. In this application,
we will use ZL0580 and YL0255 as two novel molecular probes to systemically investigate modulation of BRD4
in HIV epigenetic suppression. In Aim 1, we will determine if BRD4 is a selective protein target for
ZL0580/YL0255 and the underlying structural basis. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by
which modulation of BRD4 by ZL0580/YL0255 induces HIV epigenetic suppression. In Aim 3, as a proof of
concept, we will examine if modulation of BRD4 by ZL0580/YL0255 induces repression of latent HIV in vivo.
Collectively, these studies are critical for better understanding HIV epigenetic regulation and latency and will lay
critical groundwork for developing novel strategies for inducing HIV suppression and/or silencing in future."

Metabolic syndrome is a pandemic driven by poor nutrition and sedentary lifestyles that is associated with
being overweight or obese. Its pathology is complex, and its comorbidities—including type 2 diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, NAFLD, and cancer—are devastating. While better diets and exercise can improve
prognosis, this alone typically cannot overcome the synergy of genetics, environment, and food engineering
that collectively caused this epidemic. The health care and human costs of this pandemic are astronomical,
and thus, innovative clinical strategies are needed. What if we could burn off excess calories when at rest, or
in combination with lifestyle changes or other therapeutics? Such energy expenditure is the normal function of
brown adipose tissue (BAT). Active BAT can convert large quantities of calories into heat (rather than storing
them as fat)—a process called non-shivering thermogenesis. BAT is naturally stimulated by cold exposure, by
certain high fat diets, and by beta-adrenergic agonists. The presence of BAT in adult humans also protects
against metabolic diseases. For this reason, brown fat is often called healthy fat, and studying its biology and
therapeutic strategies to stimulate it are now key focus areas of metabolic disease research.
Glucose is a major brown fuel and it has been proposed that BAT could function therapeutically as a “glucose
sink.” It is often assumed that BAT completely metabolizes glucose to provide energy for thermogenesis
despite historical literature arguing that only a small percentage of the glucose BAT consumes is directly
oxidized. This raises a fundamental unanswered question in BAT biology—what else is glucose doing? In
fact, very little is known about BAT metabolic fluxes in general due to technical limitations in studying in vivo
organ metabolism. Here, we combine state-of-the-art technologies in mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with in
vivo stable isotope tracing and genetics to overcome previous barriers to understanding the biochemistry of
BAT metabolism. In Aim 1, we take advantage of protocols we developed to quantitatively explore how
glucose and other metabolites are used by BAT. We also explore how BAT metabolic “fluxes” are affected by
environment, diet, and gender. In Aim 2, we explore a specific auxiliary pathway that we discovered through
unbiased metabolomics to be upregulated in active BAT. Quantitatively defining the biochemistry of brown fat
metabolism and its interplay with other organs is an essential step towards reaching the ultimate goal of
harnessing brown fat’s calorie burning power to reverse obesity trends."

Research on human skin diseases has been hampered by limitations on the number of studies that can be
carried out on small skin biopsy specimens and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. This
core seeks to accelerate human skin disease research by providing access to three transformative techniques:
six color immunostaining, with spectral imaging and automated cell analyses, NanoString-based RNA and
DNA profiling and Digital Spatial Profiling. Taken together, these approaches allow comprehensive profiling of
protein, RNA and DNA targets on small samples of skin and they work equally well on FFPE samples.
Tyramide amplification based serial immunostaining allows six color labeling of FFPE specimens with no
antibody species interference; multi spectral imaging on the Mantra imaging system provides image
deconvolution and automated cell analyses, allowing identification and selective study of particular cell types
within the section. NanoString profiling allows rapid, highly quantitative measurement of up to 800 DNA or
RNA targets using minimal starting material and is the first gene expression technology to work equally well on
FFPE samples. Digital Spatial Profiling utilizes RNA and protein probes with UV sensitive linkers to provide
spatially resolved expression profiling of 10-1000s of protein or RNA targets in a section. The Core is led by
renowned dermatopathologist Dr. Martin Mihm, who will provide consultative assistance to Center users to
enhance their understanding of human skin disease. The research community can include any individual
wishing to carry out translational human skin disease research. We have included projects from 28
investigators who wish to utilize the services of this Core. In summary, this Core provides access to cutting-
edge tissue based analytic techniques that have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of
human skin diseases."
10850874,"OVERALL: ABSTRACT
In recognition of achievements in fostering transdisciplinary research, inclusive workforce development,
community engagement, and ability to enhance its impact on the catchment area (CA), the University of Florida
Health Cancer Center (UFHCC) seeks NCI-Designation. UFHCC is a matrix center that supports cancer
research and career enhancement across all 6 UF health sciences colleges (Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing,
Pharmacy, Public Health & Health Professions, and Veterinary Med) and 5 other UF colleges (Agriculture,
Engineering, Health & Human Performance, Journalism & Communications, and Liberal Arts & Sciences).
Collaborative research is conducted by 147 members across 3 UFHCC scientific programs: Mechanisms of
Oncogenesis, Cancer Therapeutics and Host Response, and Cancer Control and Population Sciences. The
UFHCC provides access to state-of-the-art technologies and research expertise for its members through 3
shared resources: Biostatistics and Quantitative Sciences, Flow Cytometry and Confocal Microscopy, and Next
Generation Sequencing. The UFHCC CA includes 23 contiguous counties in North Central Florida spanning
~17,500 mi2, about the size of Southern New England. Most of the counties (16) are rural and every county is
classified as a Medically Underserved Area. The CA population is 2.2M and includes people who are Black
(16%), Hispanic (10%), and has the highest fraction (23%) of residents ≥65 years in Florida. Through community
outreach, UFHCC supports efforts to increase health literacy, prevention, screening, and research engagement.
The UFHCC Clinical Research Office coordinates all cancer-relevant clinical research at UF, which includes a
state-wide clinical trial network. IITs are facilitated through disease site groups with an IIT Think Tank that fosters
clinician collaboration with basic and population scientists. UFHCC innovations translated to the clinic include
targeted therapies, novel immunotherapies, therapeutic modulation of the microbiome, and new strategies to
communicate with patients. UFHCC Developmental Funds seed early-stage research, support recruitment of
new faculty, and build transdisciplinary teams. UFHCC offers inclusive research career enhancement programs
across the learner spectrum. Since 2016, the UFHCC recruited 58 new members (45 external, 39 early-stage)
(45% women, 17% URM). Peer-reviewed funding increased from $21M in 2016 to $32.6M/yr in 2021 (up 55%);
NCI $9.6M to $13.2M (up 37%). Accruals to all interventional trials rose from 515 in 2016 to 1,748 in 2021 (up
3.4-fold). Institutional support of a $32M/year budget over the next 5 years and 44,000ft2 of new research space
will allow UFHCC to expand. The new UFHCC strategic plan, Momentum 2027, has 4 pillars: 1) conduct
transdisciplinary research (RNA biology, microbiome); 2) translate UFHCC discoveries to trials (immunotherapy,
small molecules, cancer communication); 3) address cancer burden (cancer and aging, cancer health
disparities); and, 4) train a prepared and diverse cancer research workforce, including leadership development.
UFHCC is poised to make a major impact on the cancer burden of the catchment area, Florida, and beyond."
10848313,"All proteins sample a diverse array of conformations (folded, unfolded, and excited states) with differing
free energies and dynamics depending on the environmental conditions. We can now predict a structural model
for the folded state given the amino acid sequence. The sequence of a protein, however, encodes much more
than just this native structure – it encodes the entire energy landscape – an ensemble of conformations whose
populations (energetics) and dynamics are finely tuned and critical for proper function and cellular health. A
major hurdle in going from sequence to function is our lack of understanding of the non-native regions of the
landscape. These high-energy conformations are important for directing the stability, dynamics and folding of a
protein, and modulations of this ensemble play a role in misfolding, protein signaling, catalytic activity, and
allostery. A compromised landscape, due to either changes in the cellular milieu, intrinsic genetic defects, or the
cumulative effects of cellular stresses, has been linked to disruption of proteostasis, resulting in varying
misfolding diseases and pathologies.
 Rare and transient conformations are, by their very nature, difficult to study. For decades, biophysical
chemists (including the PI) have been probing these fluctuations with high-level technologies using purified
proteins in a test tube. The test tube, however, is very different from the cell. In vivo, proteins live in a crowded
cellular environment, subject to quality control machinery, cellular modifications and subject to non-equilibrium
effects such as protein synthesis and degradation. In order to take full advantage of the wealth of detailed,
quantitative biophysical data available from in vitro studies, we need to understand how cellular factors and the
cellular environment modulate the energetics and dynamics. Such complex settings, however, are inaccessible
to the standard toolbox used for quantitative biophysical studies.
 The PI is an expert in the area of protein folding and dynamics, having devoted most of her career to
developing and utilizing sophisticated technologies to probe rare and transient conformations, both at the single
molecule and ensemble level. This current proposal focuses on: 1) understanding how these states are
modulated by features in the cell, such as co-translational folding, post-translational modifications, and 2)
understanding how the dynamics of conformational changes are controlled at the sequence level. The long-
term goal is a is a molecular, quantitative, and predictive understanding of the relationship between sequence
and the energy landscape, together with a predictive understanding of how the environment modulates this
landscape."

Cholesterol is an essential lipid that plays an important role in the maintenance of membrane rigidity and
permeability and is essential for the growth and viability of mammalian cells. Cholesterol also functions as a
precursor in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, bile acids, vitamin D, and is a Hedgehog signaling transducer.
In this project, we will employ cell biological and structural approaches to study the membrane proteins involved
in cholesterol signaling (Hedgehog signaling pathway), biosynthesis (cholesterol synthetic enzymes), and
storage (cholesterol esterification enzymes). 1) Dysregulation of Hedgehog (HH) signaling, which is required for
proper embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, leads to tumorigenesis. Over the past five years,
we have determined the structures of human PTCH1 alone, human PTCH1-HH complexes, SMO-Gi complexes
in distinct states, and DISP1 alone and in complex with HH. These structures, along with our functional studies,
provide molecular insights into HH signal transduction. In this project, we will continue to work on this pathway.
Specifically, we will focus on the trafficking and signal regulation of the HH ligand via the HH-PTCH1 axis. 2)
Eighteen enzymes convert acetyl-CoA into lanosterol, the first sterol-like intermediate in a series of reactions
that synthesize cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). One key reaction is mediated by HMGCR (3-
Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase), which catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to mevalonic
acid. HMGCR is a target of the cholesterol-lowering drugs statins due to its role as the rate-limiting enzyme in
cholesterol synthesis. UBIAD1 stabilizes HMGCR and prevents its degradation, while the binding of the E3 ligase
gp78 and Insig trigger the degradation of HMGCR. Recently, we determined the cryo-EM structures of HMGCR
bound to UBIAD1. The successful completion of this project will aid our investigation into how HMGCR is
ubiquitinated by gp78 via Insig. In addition, we will study how the membrane-embedded cholesterol synthetases
carry out the cholesterol biosynthesis. 3) In the ER, the ACAT enzymes (ACAT-1 and ACAT-2) catalyze the
transfer of long-chain fatty acyl groups to cholesterol, generating cholesterol esters that are integrated into
lipoproteins for secretion or storage in lipid droplets. This reaction results in a low cholesterol concentration in
the ER and is crucial for maintaining intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. ACAT-1 is ubiquitously expressed in
tissues, whereas ACAT-2 expression is restricted to the liver and intestine. Pharmacological inhibition of ACAT-
2 reduces blood cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis. Using structural methods, we plan to investigate
mechanisms for lipid-mediated regulation of ACATs to gain insight into novel modes of inhibition and use this
information to develop small molecules that specifically inhibit ACAT-2 and lower plasma LDL cholesterol."

The Plan to Enhance Diversity (PED) for the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC)
constitutes a commitment of resources to enhance diversity of membership, leadership, staff, trainees, and
advisors as a cornerstone to achieving the UWCCC mission and vision to defeat cancer through the rapid
application of groundbreaking research, prevention, and treatment. The UWCCC strives to be a diverse,
equitable, and inclusive community with a pledge to implement policies, trainings, advocacy networks, and
creative programming for that purpose. The UWCCC extends these solutions throughout our cancer training and
oncology education programs, staffing of clinical service lines and research teams, leadership and career
development programs, research groups in all forms of biological and population health sciences, and translation
to patient-centric care. Our PED specific aims are: 1) Establish and monitor metrics for understanding DEI at
UWCCC, and 2) Build and maintain a diverse workforce, leadership team, and advisory boards. PED leaders
provide a track record of academic scholarship, community and stakeholder engagement, and partnership
between the UW and the UW health system. This partnership will facilitate investment in developing and
maintaining a diverse workforce, creating collaborative initiatives, and strategically hiring into DEI pipelines. The
PED leaders will prioritize and steward diversity by creating a UWCCC Diverse Workforce and Equity
Transformation Committee (DWETC) to guide and hold UWCCC accountable to the PED. The DWETC will
monitor the implementation of the PED and will include center members at all ranks, staff, and trainees. To
facilitate our goal of increasing workforce diversity at the UWCCC, we will routinely collect both quantitative and
qualitative information from faculty, staff, trainees, and advisory board members. UWCCC’s PED framework
aligns around four core strategies highlighted in the NIH Scientific Workforce Diversity Toolkit: (1) diversify the
talent pool, (2) create unbiased talent searches, (3) drive outreach and networking for recruitment, and (4) foster
mentoring relationships for advancement and retention. To develop a more diverse and inclusive UWCCC, we
will leverage existing programs across our institution and implement new steps within our center to ensure that
the systems for education, mentoring, and career advancement are led with DEI principles. We will achieve our
aims by using evidence-based approaches to recruit and retain diverse individuals, implementing practices to
prepare members for leadership roles, expanding the workforce pipeline, and leveraging multiple institutional
resources and programs from across the UW campus. A new DEI-specific strategic plan will ensure integration
of DEI initiatives across UWCCC and UW Health while incorporating the voices of PED leaders, the DWETC,
the COE Office, the CTREC, and UWCCC’s Community Advocacy Boards. Through planning and executing our
plan to enhance diversity, we will ensure that the benefits of the research, clinical care, and education at the
UWCCC will align with the Wisconsin Idea to benefit all households in the state and beyond."
10846862,"PROJECT SUMMARY
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) interact with RNA molecules from synthesis to decay to control their metabolism,
subcellular localization, stability and translation. Methods for transcriptome-wide detection of RBP-RNA
interactions provide insights into how RBPs regulate gene expression programs and how RNA processing is
disrupted in disease state. Despite their association with disease and although the importance of regulating gene
expression is well appreciated, only a small fraction of the over 2,000 RBPs identified thus far have known RNA
targets and molecular roles. Commonly, immunoprecipitation-based technologies coupled to high throughput
(Illumina) sequencing, such as RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and Crosslinking Immunoprecipitation (CLIP),
and ribosome profiling are used to identify RBP targets and binding sites across the transcriptome. However,
these experimental protocols are labor-intensive, require large amounts of input material, are not adaptable to
high-throughput workflows. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel technology, reagent resource,
experimental protocols and a computational framework, that we collectively term STAMP (Surveying Targets By
APOBEC-Mediated Profiling), for detecting RBP-RNA targets and translation at the single-cell and single-
molecule level. In preliminary data we demonstrate, for the first time in the field, discovery of RBP-RNA sites and
translation states at single-cell resolution. We anticipate that STAMP can be used reliably to identify RNA targets,
binding sites and even extract motifs from a few cells to a single cell, thus effectively increasing limits of detection
over current methods by several orders of magnitude. Combined with simultaneous RNA-seq analyses, STAMP
will enable the combined identification of RBP binding sites and global measurement of gene expression, a long-
standing goal for the gene expression, genomics and RNA communities. As a corollary, even without single cell
analyses, STAMP can accept ultra-low input material which enables rare cell-types to be collected and analyzed
for RBP-interactomes. By applying STAMP to ribosomal proteins, we extend this approach for single-cell
detection of ribosome association while simultaneously measuring gene expression. Our conceptual and
technological innovations will, for the first time, enable translation efficiency and RBP-interactomes to be
measured at single-cell level and at scale, opening up new paradigms of biological questions."
10821402,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent exponential advancement of genome engineering technology has revived enthusiasm for its
implementation in genetic cardiomyopathies. This is especially promising for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
(ACM), a cause of sudden cardiac death and end stage heart failure. Most early genome engineering therapies
have focused on gene replacement; however, a significant minority of ACM variants likely act via dominant
negative disease mechanisms that will not respond to gene replacement therapy. RNA Binding Motif 20
(RBM20) and plakophilin 2 (PKP2) are genes associated with deadly forms of ACM in which there are both
dominant negative and haploinsufficient pathogenic variants. Variants in these genes cause cardiomyopathy
and arrhythmia by disrupting global cardiomyocyte transcriptional splicing and desmosomal structure,
respectively. hat these variants are clustered in pathogenic hotspots that align to known and novel functional
protein domains, indicating that focused study of these hotspots can illuminate differential disease mechanisms
and potentially reduce the burden of therapeutic design. Our central hypothesis is that variants in pathogenic
hotspots of RBM20 and PKP2 have differential downstream mechanisms that converge on ACM disease
phenotypes, and that these pathogenic hotspots allow the design of a genome engineering strategy to edit
many pathogenic variants with a single reagent. In Aim 1, we will identify haploinsufficient vs. dominant
negative variants in RBM20. We then use high throughput genome engineering techniques to create a library
of these variants in induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes. We will apply a combination of single cell
library preparation and long read RNAseq to define the downstream consequences of each disease
mechanism on splicing of known and novel RBM20 targets. In Aim 2, we focus on a novel dominant negative
mechanism for C-terminal PKP2 truncating variants in which they lose their plasma membrane localization,
sequestering critical desmosome components in the cytoplasm. We will use variant effect mapping to define
downstream mechanisms of a library of pathogenic PKP2 truncating variants, and will define the role of a novel
PKP2 interactor on PKP2 membrane localization. In Aim 3, we will extend our work showing the feasibility of
single prime editing (PE) reagents for correction of multiple variants in a pathogenic hotspot in vitro: We will
design engineered prime editing (epe)gRNAs with the newest high efficiency PEmax construct for the PKP2 C-
terminus hotspot and dominant negative RBM20 RS domain hotspot in vitro. We will then use innovative
methods to package PEmax in AAVMYO to correct two pathogenic murine Rbm20 RS domain variants in vivo
using the same epegRNA. We will go on to measure the effect of this editing on deep ACM phenotypes. In

a comprehensive evaluation of variant-level disease mechanism in these genes, and demonstrate the potential
of hotspot directed prime editing as a tractable genome engineering therapeutic."
10827407,"Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second-most common neurodegenerative disease. Currently there
is no curative therapy. Clinical evaluation of PD has been limited to psychophysical assessment, which is
subjective and uninformative with regard to brain neuropathological abnormalities. Developing biomarkers for
early diagnostics and treatment evaluation is critical for disease prognosis. PD cases display brain
cerebrovascular, lymphatic system and structural abnormalities which contribute to the loss of dopaminergic
neurons and movement disorders. Small pial arteries and arterioles are the primary controls of local brain
tissue perfusion for delivery of nutrients and oxygen to supply the metabolic needs of neurons, and other cells,
while lymphatic vessels play a crucial role in the clearance of waste products from brain tissues. The arterial
pulsation wave from small blood vessels is the primary driving force for the fluid in lymphatic vessels and the
perivascular space. Imbalance in the interaction between the two systems may have implications for PD
pathogenesis. We recently developed several new MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) techniques that can be
used to measure brain cerebrovascular and lymphatic system abnormalities in both humans and animal
models. We propose to test the hypothesis that abnormalities in brain microvascular and lymphatic vessels can
be measured by novel MRI techniques through PD development and progression, and that those abnormalities
can serve as potential indicators for pathogenic processes and treatment evaluation. Mutations in LRRK2
(Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2) cause genetic PD and contribute to sporadic PD. We recently generated a
LRRK2 mouse model that displayed a robust PD-like phenotype and provided an excellent model for MRI
assessment. MRI measures can be validated with invasive techniques in LRRK2 mouse models using
histological methods. The longitudinal study and therapeutic testing can be done in a relatively short time
period in these mice. Our pilot study found that mutant G2019S-LRRK2 mice display cerebrovascular
abnormalities. Thus, we propose to use new MRI methods to study brain pathophysiological changes in
cerebrovascular and lymphatic vessels underlying PD using LRRK2 mouse models with or without MPTP (a
toxin to speed disease progression) and lipopolysaccharide (a preinflammatory agent) challenge by combining
behavioral testing and brain histochemical studies. Aim 1. We will assess abnormalities in brain small blood
vessels in LRRK2 mouse models. Aim 2. We will assess abnormalities in the perivascular space and cerebral
lymphatic vessels in the brain in LRRK2 mouse models. Aim 3. We will characterize the abnormalities in the
interactions between brain microvascular and lymphatic vessels, and assess whether cerebrovascular and
lymphatic measures can be used to evaluate treatment efficacy of L-DOPA, LRRK2 kinase and GTP binding
inhibitors. These studies will advance our understanding of the neuropathological changes underlying PD
pathogenesis, which may facilitate the development of biomarkers for diagnostics and PD intervention."
10812386,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent whole-exome sequencing studies in human cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders have unmasked
frequent mutations in genes encoding chromatin regulatory proteins. Specifically, genes encoding subunits of
the mammalian SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes (also called mSWI/SNF or BAF
complexes) are perturbed in over 20% of malignancies, underscoring their critical roles in the maintenance of
timely and appropriate gene expression. The mechanisms by which mSWI/SNF family complexes are targeted
on chromatin and the features of the histone landscape that govern their activities remain unknown. Indeed, a
systematic evaluation defining the contributions of specific histone landscape features to canonical BAF, PBAF,
and non-canonical BAF complex targeting and activity would represent a significant advancement in the field at-
large. Here we aim to: (1) Determine the genome-wide targeting of distinct, final-form mSWI/SNF complexes in
human cells and the impact of select cancer-associated complex perturbations; (2) Define the in vitro
nucleosome remodeling and ATPase activities of endogenously-purified mSWI/SNF subcomplexes, BAF, PBAF,
and ncBAF, in wild-type (WT) and mutant states; and (3) Determine the impact of core histone variants and
histone tail modifications on mSWI/SNF complex nucleosome binding and activity. Taken together, successful
completion of these aims centered at the intersection of biochemistry, epigenetics, and cancer biology, will
constitute a highly timely series of advances in the field of chromatin biology, and will contribute important
knowledge regarding the mechanism of targeting of mSWI/SNF complexes across a range of both normal and
oncogenic states. Given that a major impediment to the development of on-target modulatory agents of
mSWI/SNF complexes lies in the lack of biological understanding of complex-specific targeting and functional
regulation, the results of this proposal are likely to provide the basis for new approaches toward targeted
disruption of mSWI/SNF-chromatin interactions."

Title:Delineation of pathogenic mechanisms of NOS1AP and TRIM8 mutations in monogenic SRNS/FSGS
Steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is a leading cause of childhood chronic kidney disease1, marked
by proteinuria and edema. Renal biopsy typically reveals focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). 59% of
children with SRNS are unresponsive to standard therapy1,2. A majority of them progress to end-stage renal
disease with loss of the kidney glomerular filtering cells, podocytes1,2. Mendelian genetic causes of SRNS/FSGS
have been detected in ~11-30% of pediatric cases3–6. SRNS/FSGS disease genes encode critical pathway
components in podocyte biology2,7–10. Human mutations impair these SRNS/FSGS pathways, causing
podocytopathies2,7–10.
 The proposed research will explore the pathogenic mechanisms underlying two novel monogenic causes of
SRNS/FSGS in human NOS1AP and TRIM8 mutations, which were discovered by the applicant. The applicant’s
preliminary data generated the hypothesis that human NOS1AP and TRIM8 mutations cause SRNS/FSGS
through dysregulation of the CDC42 pathway and TRIM8 E3 ligase functions, respectively. The applicant,
thus, proposes the following specific aims (SAs) using innovative cell biological, proteomics, and mouse
models approaches: (SA1) Define the mechanism of CDC42 dysregulation caused by NOS1AP SRNS
mutations; (SA2) Dissect the pathogenesis of TRIM8 SRNS/FSGS mutations in podocytes; (SA3) Delineate the
pathogenesis of NOS1AP and TRIM8 mutations in SRNS in mice.
 The applicant has created a comprehensive career development plan supported by his mentor to (1)
ensure his progress and success in carrying out this research proposal and (2) to facilitate his transition
to an independent research career focused on disease modeling of nephrotic syndrome. This plan begins
with regular meetings with his mentor and advisory committee—national and global academic leaders in
medicine and science—to provide research and career guidance. The plan additionally includes (i) research and
career development seminars, (ii) proteomics and microscopy methodology courses and (iii) activities for career
growth including conference presentations and publications, mentoring of junior trainees, and application for
independent research funding. The applicant and mentor have, also, agreed upon a transition plan to distinguish
himself from the mentor’s laboratory. His training will be carried out in an unparalleled academic environment at
Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, which provides dedicated career development
programs and all necessary research support and supplies through his mentor and institutional core services.
Collectively, this research and career development proposal is a product of the applicant’s ambition and
capacity to transition to an independent research career in nephrology."
10812325,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 mTOR plays a critical role in integrating signals from the immune microenvironment to regulate T cell
activation, differentiation and function. We have been able to demonstrate that the Tuberous Sclerosis
Complex 2 (TSC2) protein plays an important role in regulating mTORC1 activation in T cells. TSC2 is a
RasGap protein that inhibits the activity of Rheb GTPase that in turn activates mTORC1. We have shown
that genetic deletion of TSC2 in T cells leads to enhanced mTORC1 activity and a marked increase in
CD8+ T cell effector function. However, while TSC2-/- T cells respond robustly to viruses and tumors, their
persistent mTORC1 activity leads to a decrease in memory CD8+ T cell generation. Recently, the Kass lab
has identified a novel phosphorylation site on TSC2 that regulates mTORC1 activity in cardiac myocytes.
Phosphorylation of this site (S1365) leads to the inhibition of mTORC1 signaling. Mutating this site(SA)
leads to an increase mTORC1 activity and the development of worse heart disease and mortality from
pressure-overload (PO) stress. Alternatively, creating a phosphomimetic (SE) at this site mitigates
mTORC1 activity and imparts protection from heart failure upon pressure overload. We hypothesized that
the TSC2 (S1365) site might play an important role in regulating mTORC1 activity in T cells. Our
preliminary studies demonstrate that upon TCR engagement this site is indeed phosphorylated. T cells
harboring the SA mutation have unaltered mTORC1 activity in the non-stimulated condition (unlike TSC2-/-
T cells), but show markedly increased activity upon TCR engagement. T cells with the SE mutation exhibit
the opposite. Furthermore, phosphorylation of TSC2 (S1365) is markedly induced by hypoxia, low pH and
reactive oxygen species suggesting that this pathway plays a critical role in integrating stress signals in
order to regulate T cell differentiation and function. In this project we seek to define and understand a novel
and selective mechanism of mTORC1 regulation in T cells. The overall goal of this proposal is to dissect
the mechanisms by which phosphorylation of TSC2 at S1365 regulates mTORC1 activation in T cells, and
consequently selectively regulates T cell activation, differentiation and function. Upon the completion of this
proposal our findings will help elucidate novel and critical mTORC1 regulatory signaling mechanisms in T
cells, and have implications for developing vaccines and engineering more robust T cells for Adoptive
Cellular Therapy. This may in turn result in improved treatment strategies for preventing and treating
infections as well as cancer."
10808186,"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a leading cause of blindness in children, afflicts ~14,000 premature infants
yearly in the US. About 1,500 of those develop severe ROP, requiring treatment. ROP has increased in the last
decade due to (1) increased multiple (and more preterm) births after in vitro fertilization; (2) increased
survival at low gestational ages at high ROP risk; and (3) higher levels of supplemental oxygen with more ROP
incidence. Current treatments (laser photocoagulation and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
drugs) target late-phase retinal neovascularization and have adverse effects. We need to find new ways to treat
ROP. Nutrient deficiency occurs in preterm infants and is associated with ROP development. Early full amino
acid supplementation, starting the first day of life, improves weight gain, which in turn reduces ROP risk.
However, specific amino acid requirements are unknown. Circulating L-serine levels are lower in premature
infants with lower gestational age and higher risk for ROP. We preliminarily found that L-serine
supplementation prevents retinal neovascularization in a mouse model of ROP, and retinal glia might be the
primary retinal cells in response to L-serine. Therefore, we propose that:
L-serine affects retinal neovascularization by controlling glial cell angiogenic factors.
In the mouse model of ROP, we will examine if (1) L-serine supplements inhibits retinal neovascularization; (2)
retinal glial cells (which control neovascularization) mediate L-serine inhibitory effect on OIR; and (3) L-serine
decreases OIR by regulating glial pro-angiogenic factors via lactate.
This study will determine (1) if oral or i.p. L-serine inhibits neovascularization in OIR, modeling ROP and (2)
the role of glial cell L-serine synthesis and key mechanistic pathways in controlling pathologic retinal vessel
growth. Successful completion of our study will likely establish a critical role of L-serine in ROP prevention.
There is high translational value in this work, as oral or i.v. delivery of L-serine to preterm
infants is very feasible. Systemic L-serine supplementation may prevent ROP and might possibly prevent
other complications of preterm birth (intraventricular hemorrhage or bronchopulmonary dysplasia)."

Project Summary
The exquisite chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity of enzymes make them attractive tools for organic synthesis, in
particular for the generation of optically active synthons and intermediates for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other
biologically active molecules. Reflecting this notion, there have been growing interest and efforts within the
pharmaceutical industry toward developing efficient, selective, cost-effective, and sustainable enzyme-catalyzed
transformations for drug synthesis and manufacturing. Progress in this direction is critically hampered, however, by the
inherently limited range of chemical transformations catalyzed by natural enzymes as compared to those accessible
through chemical methods. During the previous grant period, we have demonstrated that myoglobin—a small, robust, and
structurally tunable heme-containing protein—, constitutes a highly promising, versatile, and robust scaffold for
developing efficient and stereoselective biocatalysts for abiological carbene transfer reactions. Building upon this
foundational work and other exciting preliminary results, the proposed research aims at investigating and extending the
scope of these hemoprotein catalysts to a range of new, asymmetric carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond forming
transformations useful for the synthesis of optically active building blocks and complex organic scaffolds of direct value
for medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. Synergizing with these efforts, complementary strategies based on rational
mechanism-guided design and combinatorial/high-throughput approaches will be implemented to expedite the discovery
and optimization of myoglobin-based carbene transferases with enhanced catalytic efficiency, expanded reactivity, and
fine-tuned stereoselectivity. The studies above will be complemented by detailed mechanistic studies on these reactions
and catalysts using a combination of experimental, spectroscopic, computational, and structural methods. These studies
will furnish key insights into the kinetic, structural, and electronic properties of reaction intermediates and they will shed
light into structural determinants underlying catalyst-controlled reactivity and stereoselectivity, enabling a deeper
understanding of these processes and informing further catalyst design. The synthetic value of these methodologies will be
further demonstrated through their application to the stereoselective synthesis of drug molecules and in support of focused
medicinal chemistry projects. Successful completion of this research is expected to make available new efficient,
selective, and sustainable biocatalytic strategies for promoting asymmetric carbene transfer reactions, which will create
new opportunities for the synthesis and discovery of biologically active molecules."

10824341,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Previous randomized controlled trials (RCT)s demonstrate that low-dose aspirin (LDA, 81-100mg/day) reduces
the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends LDA to
prevent CRC in adults aged 50-59. However, a recent RCT among 19,114 older (65+) individuals reported that
initiating LDA late in life had no benefit on CRC incidence and was potentially detrimental for mortality. Because
CRC incidence rises with age, understanding the relationship and functional impact of aging on the
chemopreventive effects of LDA is a high priority. Our working model is that the effect of LDA on the colon
differs in older individuals due to age-related changes in intestinal stem cell (ISC) number and function secondary
to a process of higher basal inflammatory tone, a.k.a. “inflammaging”. Normally, CRC appears to be primarily
driven by oncogenic mutations in Lgr5+ ISCs and aspirin-like NSAIDs appear to preferentially eliminate
premalignant Lgr5+ ISCs. However, our preliminary data demonstrates that old mice (20-22 months [mos]), as
compared to young mice (2-3 mos), have fewer, less regenerative small intestinal Lgr5+ ISCs, which are also
less tumorigenic in an Apc tumor suppressor model. Nonetheless, like humans, aged mice spontaneously
develop a greater number of tumors, indicating that non-Lgr5+ cells are also the origin of intestinal cancers in
aged mice and that these cells are less sensitive to LDA. LDA modulates prostaglandin (PG) levels, including
PGE2. We also find that PGE2 impacts ISC function through its receptor Ptger4 and this signaling can drive ISCs
into a fetal-like state (Hopx+) that is mediated by Hippo/Yap signaling. Thus, in the setting of inflammaging,
elevated PGE2 may irreversibly compromise the colon (cISC) pool leading to compensatory functions within
select cISCs that promote tumorigenesis. Through our double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT, we demonstrated
that modulation of PG tone and inhibition of PG synthesis is central to aspirin’s mode of action. Our central
hypothesis is that aging and age-related processes promote a decrease in the cISC pool (Lgr5+ cISCs) that is
normally sensitive to aspirin chemoprevention. We propose that initiation of LDA earlier in life protects against
this age-related, inflammation-associated, and/or PGE2-mediated damage to the cISC pool. In contrast, with
advancing age there may be a “point-of-no-return” in which initiation of LDA is no longer protective against age-
related changes in the cISC pool. In this proposal, we will expand our existing RCT to examine the impact of
LDA on colonic epithelium at single cell resolution, patient-derived organoids, and urinary PGs in older adults.
We will use novel in vivo preclinical models to dissect the role of inflammaging on PG signaling and LDA on
cISCs. We will then examine the causality of these pathways on colon tumor incidence and progression. These
studies may offer a biological explanation for the unexpected finding of a differential effect of LDA in older adults,
which may influence clinical guidelines or the development of biomarkers to optimize LDA’s risk-benefit profile."

The UAB-HudsonAlpha Genomic Medicine Training Program was established four years ago to train
leaders in the integration of genetics and genomics into medical practice. We have recruited fellows with
an MD, PhD, or PharmD degree who participate in customized educational training and pursue mentored
research at UAB or HudsonAlpha. The educational plan is based on a set of competencies that equip the
trainee with the knowledge and skill set to be an independent genomic medicine researcher. Each trainee
also completes a genomic medicine practicum that provides exposure to clinics and clinical laboratories,
an educational outreach project, an opportunity to explore entrepreneurship career opportunities, and
training in the responsible conduct of research and rigor and reproducibility in research. The trainees
carry out mentored research under the auspices of one of 60 program faculty, as part of an individualized
development plan. Conferences at UAB and HudsonAlpha include research seminars, genome
sequencing case review conferences, a molecular tumor board, and a monthly genomic medicine
meeting, which provide a foundation and common platform for all trainees. All trainees attend the annual
NHGRI training conference and present either posters or platform presentations and present their work
at a Work in Progress seminar at UAB. Trainee progress is monitored in biannual written reports and
meetings with each trainee and mentor together with the program co-directors. Several innovations
have been instituted since the inception of the program four years ago. These include the monthly
genomic medicine conference and the entrepreneurship practicum; the latter leverages the strong
relationship of HudsonAlpha with biotechnology companies hosted on the HudsonAlpha campus. In
order to increase our ability to recruit MDs, we have forged relationships with the UAB Department of
Surgery and Department of Medicine, both of which have programs that enable residents to pursue two
or more years of research during the course of their training. We have also added an introductory lecture
series on the basics of genomic medicine to ensure that all trainees are equipped with basic skills in
genomic medicine, including, for example, data management and sharing. The required education in
Rigor and Reproducibility in Research is also a new addition. We have strengthened our outreach efforts
to enhance the recruitment of minorities to the program. This includes leveraging relationships we have
forged with Historically Black Colleges and Universities in Alabama through our R25 DAP program
“Summer Undergraduate Experience in Genomic Medicine (SURE-GM)” and with the Muscogee (Creek)
Nation. Finally, we have adapted a program evaluation approach initially developed for SURE-GM to

10834088,"Protein synthesis underpins a cell’s decision to growth, proliferate and/or differentiate.2,6,11–14,14,15,18
Understanding how protein synthesis allow cells to perform these fundamental activities is a major challenge in
biology. Therefore, there is a critical need to elucidate the mechanisms determining protein synthesis rates and
whether these mechanisms operate in a cell type-specific manner to impart a new layer of regulation in the
control of gene expression. To explore these questions, two orthogonal, but complementary, research programs,
namely Program 1 and 2, have been designed. Program 1 investigates new factors and mechanisms involved
in the regulated assembly of ribosomes in stem cells. Program 1 is built upon recent studies from my lab and
others demonstrating that stem cells relies on ribosome assembly to ensure adequate protein synthesis rates
and the transition from self-renewal to differentiation.2,3,6,11–14,14,15,18 My lab has characterized the composition of
the small subunit (SSU) processome in human cells, and identified DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as
an RNA-dependent regulator of ribosome assembly and proteins synthesis in hematopoietic stem cells.6 Thus,
the immediate goal of Program 1 is to establish the mechanisms by which DNA-PK regulates ribosome
biogenesis in stem cells. Program 2 explores how customizing ribosome assembly and function contributes to
protein synthesis and selective mRNA translation during embryogenesis. Program 2 is underscored by recent
findings suggesting that ribosomes composition and activity are dynamically regulated in a cell type- and tissue-
specific manner, allowing protein expression to be regulated with exquisite temporal and spatial precision.8,12
The immediate goal of Program 2 is to generate in vivo model systems to understand how the cell creates and
regulates ribosome heterogeneity and the importance of this form of regulation for proper cellular function and
organismal development. To address these, we have generated transgenic zebrafish in which two
compositionally distinct and developmentally regulated ribosomes have been genetically labeled, a unique and
powerful tool to study functional aspects of the ribosome in an in vivo developmental model system. Over the
next five years, we expect Program 1 and 2 to uncover new mechanisms regulating ribosomes assembly and
function in stem cells and vertebrate development and to provide powerful insights into ribosomopathies, tissue-
specific disorders linked to defects in ribosome biogenesis and function."

The incorporation of Immune checkpoint blockade into anticancer armamentarium has revolutionized cancer
therapy in recent years, with FDA approved agents in multiple cancer types. Nevertheless, there is an urgent
need to identify additional therapeutic strategies to increase durable response rates. Induction of immunogenic
cell death is one of such strategies. The BCL-2 family proteins are central regulators of mitochondrial apoptosis
and consist of (1) multidomain antiapoptotic BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1, (2) multidomain proapoptotic BAX
and BAK, and (3) proapoptotic BH3-only molecules (BH3s). BAX and BAK are the essential effectors of MOMP
whereas BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1 preserve mitochondrial integrity. BH3s are death sentinels that relay
upstream apoptotic signals to initiate apoptosis by either activating BAX/BAK or inactivating BCL-2/BCL-
XL/MCL-1. Through an interconnected hierarchical network of interactions, the BCL-2 family proteins integrate
developmental and environmental cues to dictate the survival versus death decision of cells. The research on
the BCL-2-regulated apoptotic pathway has not only revealed its importance in both normal physiological and
disease processes, but has also resulted in the first anti-cancer drug targeting protein-protein interactions.
Recent paradigm-shifting discoveries have shown that BAX/BAK activation in the absence of caspases can
trigger the release of mitochondrial DNA to the cytosol through a process called “mitochondrial inner
membrane permeabilization” (MIMP), which in turn activates the cGAS/STING pathway and type I interferon
response. Hence, the BCL-2 family plays a crucial role not only in the decision of cells to live or commit suicide
but also in the decision to die in an immunologically silent or inflammatory manner. The discovery of MIMP and
its role in activating immunogenic cell death opens up exciting new avenues for cancer cell death research.
However, the molecular and biochemical basis of MIMP remains uncharacterized. Furthermore, it is unclear
whether induction of MIMP in tumors will affect the tumor-immune crosstalk and immunotherapy response. In
this grant application, we have formulated a comprehensive plan to interrogate the biochemical and molecular
basis of MIMP and exploit MIMP as a therapeutic strategy to improve and enhance immunotherapy. Our
studies will not only provide novel mechanistic insights into the BCL-2-regulated cell death program but also
lay the foundation for targeting the BCL-2 family to induce immunogenic cell death and thereby enhance
cancer immunotherapy."

This is a renewal application to support training in malaria epidemiology, translational research, and
implementation science to strengthen malaria policy and control in Uganda. Our program has been highly
successful, however, the need for training in malaria research remains great. The high burden of malaria in
Uganda persists, and progress in control has stalled since 2015, with increases in incidence observed the
last few years. Moreover, new challenges have arisen, including the spread of insecticide resistance, the
emergence of artemisinin resistance and the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast to the magnitude of the malaria
burden in Uganda, the number of malaria researchers remains limited. These observations highlight the need
for continued research that informs optimal malaria interventions, and thus a necessity for the training of
Ugandans to lead this research. We propose to continue our training program, with some adjustments
informed by a comprehensive needs assessment and the new challenges identified. Our long-term goal is to
strengthen capacity to conduct independent and sustainable malaria research at Makerere University to
address challenges of malaria control in Uganda. The objectives of this application are: 1) to expand the
current program to include translational research, genomics and bioinformatics to address the complex
challenges of malaria control; 2) to strengthen institutional capacity of Makerere U in malaria research by
providing Master’s and PhD mentored research training for junior faculty and graduate students; 3) to
substantially increase scientific leadership and expertise needed for independent malaria research in Uganda
through postdoctoral training; and 4) to create sustained growth of malaria research at Makerere U by
strengthening the Malaria Center. We have assembled a strong team of program faculty from Uganda, the
US and Europe already collaborating on several research projects in Uganda, and with extensive experience
in research and higher-level training, to ensure high-quality supervision and mentoring of trainees. Degree
and non-degree training will occur in Uganda and collaborating institutions. In the next five years, we will train
candidates as follows: 1) five in 2-year post-doctoral programs; 2) five in 4-year PhD programs; 3) eight in 2-
year master’s degree programs; and 4) four in a 1–2-year Implementation Science fellowship. Trainees will
be required to take didactic courses, conduct mentored research projects, and acquire professional
development skills through participation in Malaria Center activities. The intended outcomes are: 1)
establishment of a critical mass of Ugandan scientists trained in malaria research; 2) increased malaria
research outputs at Makerere U including scientific publications and new research grants; and 3) increased
dissemination of generated evidence to inform the design and implementation of programs and policies to
control malaria in Uganda. Improved expertise in malaria research will be critical to assist the Ministry of

Lynch syndrome (LS) is a hereditary disease that predisposes patients to colorectal, endometrial, ovarian and
other cancers. LS is caused by inherited mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, defects in which
also underlie 15-30% of sporadic colorectal cancers. Loss of MMR function is associated with a 1,000-fold
increase in mutation rate likely increasing the risk of mutation to important oncogenes and tumor suppressors.
The MMR pathway also activates cell cycle checkpoints and cell death in response to exogenous DNA damage,
however, the role of this damage response in preventing tumorigenesis is not known. We hypothesize that
colonic stem cells (CSCs) that lose this MMR-dependent damage response will gain a selective advantage over
neighboring MMR-proficient cells, particularly in a mutagenic environment such as may be found in the colon.
We predict that loss of MMR will enhance survival under conditions of increased DNA damage, favoring these
cells in a competition for stem cell niche occupancy. Ultimately, this will lead to the production of more
hypermutable intestinal cells, increasing the penetrance of the cancer phenotype. Testing this hypothesis has
been problematic previously due to lack of a suitable model system. However, the recent development of human
colonic organoid and enteroid models now allow us to study the effects of MMR loss on CSC dynamics via the
following aims: 1) Determine whether loss of MMR function in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) leads to an
immediate advantage in the absence or presence of exogenous DNA damaging agents. We will use
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to knock out the MMR genes in hESCs and examine their growth and
damage response as well as determine the mechanism underlying those responses. 2) Determine whether
MMR-deficient CSCs have a selective advantage in colonic organoids and colonic enteroids. For this purpose,
we will differentiate MMR-proficient and deficient hESCs into colonic organoids. As a complementary model, we
will also create MMR knock out enteroids from human adult colon tissue samples. Using both systems, we will
compare the response to exogenous DNA damaging agents or oncogenic stress. We will also create mixed
organoids containing MMR-proficient and deficient cells and test whether the MMR-deficient cells have a growth
or survival advantage over time in the presence or absence of DNA damage. 3) Determine whether MMR loss
leads to a selective advantage for CSCs in vivo. We will use an inducible, stem cell specific knockout mouse
model of Msh2 to create mosaic intestinal crypts and test whether MMR-deficient CSCs outcompete wild-type
CSCs. Together, these aims utilize novel approaches to study the mechanism by which loss of MMR function
contributes to tumorigenesis providing information that may help explain disease penetrance while guiding the
diagnosis, prevention and treatment of LS-associated cancers."
10865087,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness, affecting approximately 1 in 3-4
extremely low birth weight premature infants. Preterm delivery requires exposing these neonates to relative
hyperoxia because of their lung immaturity. Hyperoxia leads to vessel attenuation in the retina, which results in
local hypoxia, which then fuels abnormal compensatory neovascularization (NV). This process is mediated by
altered expression of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Though the neuroretina
has been described to play a role in pro-angiogenic signaling in ROP, the mechanisms remain poorly understood.
Current therapies for ROP treat late retinal neovascularization and do not address neuroretinal dysfunction in
ROP. In this grant, we propose to understand the role of an upstream regulator of VEGF, epithelial membrane
protein-2 (EMP2), in an oxygen-induced murine model of retinopathy.
EMP2, a tetraspanin membrane protein important for cell-to-cell signaling, regulates angiogenesis via VEGF and
hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)1α modulation in select cancers and placental diseases. We hypothesize that
EMP2 serves as a regulator of hypoxia-mediated pathological neoangiogenesis in the eye as well. Our
preliminary data from a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) demonstrates that genetic knock out
of EMP2 attenuates NV and suppresses HIF1α and VEGFA expression in the neuroretina. Moreover, OIR
induces EMP2 expression in the neuroretina, which in physiologic states, has low expression in the neuroretina
and high expression in the RPE and cornea. However, the role for EMP2 expression and its function in the
developing neuroretina is unknown. The goals of this proposal are to determine the temporal and spatial
expression and function of EMP2 in normal retinal development as well as in pathologic conditions of OIR. Thus,
we seek to understand the mechanisms by which EMP2 regulates neuroretinal angiogenic signaling. We
hypothesize that EMP2 expression, normally isolated to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in the adult mouse
retina, is increased in neuroretinal cells in OIR in the developing eye (Aim 1), where it directly regulates HIF-
mediated VEGF production from these cells (Aim 2). We further hypothesize that antibody-mediated targeting of
EMP2 will safely and effectively attenuate pathologic NV (Aim 3).
Our approach is multidisciplinary, with experts in neonatology/vascular disease in neonates, EMP2 biology,
retinal diseases, genomics, and advanced imaging. We will utilize biochemical, physiological, genomic, and
optical imaging methods in vivo to assess EMP2 expression, function, and the downstream angiogenic effect.
The central innovations of this study are to: (1) further our understanding of the neuroretina’s role in oxygen-
induced retinopathy via EMP2-mediated angiogenic growth factor production, and (2) apply the knowledge of
EMP2’s effects on angiogenesis via VEGF expression in cancer, placentation, and adult eye disease to ROP."
10873737,"Project Summary
The human genome exists in the cell nucleus as chromatin, a complex of the DNA with histone proteins.
Though genetic information is encoded in the DNA sequence, another layer of information, is encoded in the
histone proteins, specifically in the form of post-translational modifications (PTMs). This layer of information is
often referred to as epigenomics, and provides instructions on how the genome is to be regulated. Chromatin
and the epigenomic content, is highly dynamic, constantly restructuring in response to developmental and
environmental cues. One of the most important questions in biology is how this information is interpreted by
transcriptional and other regulatory complexes, leading to gene regulation and cell fate. Histone modifications
are “read” through small subdomains within the regulatory complexes called reader domains, and specificity for
a unique epigenomic pattern is thought to be achieved through the integrated activity of multiples of these
reader domains. However, though much is known about the association of reader domains with fragments of
histones, the molecular mechanims underlying how they associate with histones in a chromatin relevent
context, or how they function together to readout a specific epigenomic state, are not well understood.
This research program addresses this fundamental question in chromatin regulation. We are pioneering the
use of NMR spectroscopy to study the association of reader domains with the basic unit of chromatin, the
nucleosome. We are combining this with fluorescence microscopy, cryo-electron microscopy, and basic
biochemistry for an overall multidisciplinary approach to building models of these complexes. Over the next five
years we will focus on how the conformation of the nucleosome regulates readout of epigenomic signatures.
We will continue our investigation of the nucleosome conformation itself and how known cancer mutations
dysregulate this. In addition, we will determine the kinetic and structural basis of association of reader domains
from the PBAF chromatin remodeling and PRC1 histone modifying complexes with nucleosomes. Through
collaborative studies we will investigate the functional consequence of these interactions. We will continue to
build towards our long-term goal of understand of how multiple reader domains integrate to allow regulatory
complexes to navigate and respond to a dynamic chromatin substrate. Results from this research program will
reveal fundamental mechanisms of chromatin regulation, provide insight into the etiology of a number of
human diseases, and lay the groundwork for the development of targeted therapeutics."
10909806,"Project Summary
Cells live in diverse environments and cellular communities, from the cells in our bodies to single-celled
organisms surviving in the soil. To navigate these complex environments, cells must be able to sense and
respond to a variety of signals. This is done through biological signaling pathways, consisting of sensors and
interacting proteins, which process external signals and transmit information. My research program focuses on
understanding how these biological networks transmit information about external signals to the activity of
intracellular effectors, such as transcription factors, to generate an appropriate cellular response or state and
how these cell states affect community-level phenotypes. Understanding this signal processing represents a key
gap in our knowledge of how healthy and diseased cells make decisions and guide the behavior of cellular
communities. Specifically, we ask (1) How do signaling networks transform extracellular signals into appropriate
intracellular signals? (2) How are intracellular signals interpreted by the cell to generate appropriate responses?
and (3) How do individual cell decisions affect population-level community phenotypes?
Our research is focused on understanding signaling specificity and kinetics in the mitogen-activated kinase
(MAPK) pathways as well as transcription factor dynamics and subsequent gene expression in response to
environmental stress. MAP kinase pathways are conserved from yeast to humans and control vital cellular
processes including proliferation, differentiation, and stress response. We use a variety of systems to address
the questions outlined in this research proposal including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the human fugal pathogen
Candida albicans, synthetic signaling pathways, and mammalian cell culture. We take a multi-pronged approach
that uses microfluidic and optogenetic tools to perturb signaling pathways and combine these perturbations with
mathematical modeling to understand how different properties of signaling pathways, including bandwidth and
crosstalk, allow them to appropriately transform their input signals. Furthermore, we use these tools to drive
dynamics of intracellular effectors, such as transcription factors, and ask how these different effector dynamics
generate cellular responses. And finally, we use the exquisite spatiotemporal control available with light to
generate desired states in individual or populations of cells, including fungal biofilms, and ask how this affects
community-level phenotypes."

UNM HSC CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE CENTER: OVERALL
SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our vision for the University of New Mexico (UNM) Health Sciences Center (HSC) Clinical and Translational
Science Center (CTSC) is to catalyze scientific discovery into improved health by enabling high quality clinical
and translational research (CTR) – locally, regionally, and nationally. It is not an exaggeration that in our first
two funding cycles (CTSC 1.0 funded in 2010 and CTSC 2.0 funded in 2015), UNM CTSC created a research
ecosystem that transformed UNM HSC by providing needed services and training, demonstrating and
disseminating methods and processes to support CTR, and building new partnerships, all of which
substantially grew our research enterprise and its impact. We accomplished this by building on local strengths
and addressing geographic and demographic needs. Being an agent of continuous improvement, we will
further enhance our activities in CTSC 3.0. During CTSC 1.0 and 2.0, we catalyzed CTR through new training
and services. These activities and findings were disseminated to CTR partners in all 34 counties statewide,
including health organizations, community providers, social service agencies, K-12 schools, industry, and
others. This established UNM CTSC as the academic focal point for CTR at UNM HSC, in NM, and in our
regional consortium, which includes 7 states and 13 public universities. With this landscape, we are positioned
to achieve the mission laid out by NCATS for CTSA hubs to “support high quality collaborative translational
science locally, regionally, and nationally; foster scientific and operational innovation to improve the efficiency
and effectiveness of clinical translational research; and create, provide, and disseminate domain-specific
translational science training and workforce development.” We will accomplish this through 5 aims: 1) build a
diverse, sustainable biomedical research workforce, and ensure that investigators and their teams have skills
and knowledge necessary to advance the translation of discoveries through innovations and execution of our
career development, workforce training and related programs; 2) engage in beneficial collaboration and
partnerships locally, regionally, and nationally; and includes stakeholder engagement at all stages of CTR; 3)
discover, develop, demonstrate, and disseminate innovative research resources, methods, and processes to
catalyze CTR from discovery to implementation in communities; 4) further integrate multiple phases and
disciplines across the translational research spectrum and include special populations across the lifespan to
ensure that translational advances are realized in all populations; and 5) expand our informatics capabilities
with innovative solutions to deliver tools, training, collaboration, dissemination of best practices, and EHR data
to accelerate the science and operations of CTR. By accomplishing these aims, CTSC 3.0 will: 1) continue
expansion of CTR in NM and the MWRC; 2) catalyze new discoveries and developments, demonstrate
efficacy, and disseminate findings through our resources and services; and 3) address health disparities,
geographic and rural challenges, and special populations in our state and region.

 Dr. Tamar Rubinstein is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Pediatric Rheumatology at
Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Dr. Rubinstein’s career goal is to identify modifiable biopsychosocial targets
in high-risk youth with childhood-onset systemic lupus (cSLE) and test interventions that improve their outcomes
and mitigate critical health disparities. She holds a MS in Clinical Research Methods and will augment this
training through formal coursework and mentorship from a multi-disciplinary team to develop knowledge and
skills in behavioral constructs assessment, biostatistics, clinical study design, patient-engaged methods, and
research ethics. This will enable her to achieve independent research status with high caliber studies to
investigate how clinical, psychological, and socio-ecological factors impact outcomes of youth with cSLE and
test novel interventions in high-risk cSLE populations. Research: Critical disparities in cSLE care and outcomes
threaten the lives of youth with cSLE who are of color and low-income. Disengagement in care is common in
adolescents and young adults (AYA) with cSLE and can lead to disease progression, damage accrual, and
death. However, little is known about modifiable factors that influence disengagement. Specific attention to
depression is warranted due to its known association with engagement in other chronic diseases, a strong
association with other health behaviors in cSLE, and the documented very high comorbidity of depression in
cSLE. Low-income and minority youth are disproportionately affected by depression and may be particularly
affected by disengagement. The population of focus in this study is AYA with cSLE from The Bronx, New York,
which is predominantly of color and low-income. We suggest that anhedonia, a core symptom of depression, is
associated with disengagement, and that engagement is a practical target to improve cSLE outcomes. We will
pilot an adapted mobile app targeting engagement in SLE care. This work will provide the basis for a R01 to
further study biopsychosocial mechanisms of disease progression and interventional targets to improve
outcomes in vulnerable cSLE groups. This work will position Dr. Rubinstein to become an independent clinical
investigator in patient-centered research in cSLE. Environment: (1) Dr. Rubinstein’s Department Chair and
Division Chief enthusiastically support her and ensure that >75% of her time will be protected for research and
education during the award. (2) The Einstein Lupus Cohort is an established longitudinal cohort that this project
will leverage along with resources from the Psychiatry Research Institute of Montefiore/Einstein. (3) The multi-
disciplinary research team includes experts in psychiatry, sociology, biostatistics, and SLE, with expertise in
longitudinal, interventional, and patient-engaged methods. (4) The community setting in The Bronx, New York,
comprises a low-income population of color with an increased prevalence of cSLE and depression, a high rate
of disengagement in care, and poor cSLE outcomes."
10834197,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and comorbid alcohol use disorder (AUD) cause heavy medical, economic, and
social burdens. TBI drives the escalation of alcohol intake in TBI patients and animal models. One challenge is
that TBI and comorbid AUD (alcohol misuse following TBI) is difficult to manage with current treatment options.
Another challenge is that the molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol misuse following TBI are lacking. Thus,
it is urgently needed to explore novel therapies and molecular mechanisms for AUD following TBI. We and others
reported that N-acetyl-serotonin (NAS) offers protection by targeting neurotoxicity and inflammation in various
tissue injuries. However, it is unknown whether NAS alleviates AUD following TBI. The central hypothesis of this
translational project is that NAS mitigates TBI-induced alcohol consumption. The overall goal is to develop a
novel NAS therapy to alleviate TBI-increased alcohol intake and preference and elucidate its protective
mechanisms by regulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB)/Akt
pathway, and inflammation. This study is supported by preliminary data and prior research: 1) NAS is a potent
agonist of TrkB, and the BDNF/TrkB pathway plays an important role in alcohol consumption. 2) we and others
report that NAS inhibits neurotoxicity in cultured neurons and offers protection in animal models of cerebral
ischemia and retinal ischemia-reperfusion. 3) we and others reported that NAS protects hepatic cell apoptosis
and hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury and acts on circadian rhythm by TrkB activation. 4) our preliminary data
suggest that NAS alleviates TBI-induced alcohol intake and preference, cognitive decline, and neurobehavioral
deficit in a few mice in vivo and prevents neurotoxicity in scratch- and ethanol-treated cultured neuronal cells, a
cell injury model of alcohol use following TBI in vitro. 5) we show that NAS reduces interleukin-1β (IL-1 and IL-
6 releases in scratch- and ethanol-treated astrocytes, another cell injury model of alcohol use following TBI, and
6) we found that NAS alleviates BDNF reduction in TBI-induced alcohol consumption exposed mice.
 Aim 1 will test whether NAS alleviates TBI-induced alcohol consumption, neurodegeneration, and cognitive
and neurobehavioral impairments in mice and determine whether TrkB deficiency, at least partly, reduces NAS’s
benefits in TrkB knockout mice. Aim 2 will determine whether the protective mechanisms of NAS are mediated
by regulating BDNF expression, activating TrkB/Akt pathway, and inhibiting inflammation as well as the
regulation of BDNF/TrkB/Akt pathway of NAS are mediated by activation of TrkB using TrkB knockout mice.
 The success of this study will make an important contribution to drug discovery and pathogenesis for alcohol
misuse following TBI. Key strengths include: i) Usage of TBI, AUD, and TBI-induced alcohol intake and
preference animal models; ii) Extensive experience in the study of NAS in a variety of tissue injuries; and iii) A
strong team with interdisciplinary and complementary expertise and an excellent history of collaborative
publications in the fields of AUD, alcohol consumption, inflammation, neurotoxicity, and drug development."

  Bats are important reservoirs for diverse viral pathogens affecting humans. However, we have a poor 
understanding  of the  key bat  innate  immunity factors  that  restrict  virus  replication.  Functional  assays  that  can 
identify  bat  factors  that  are  truly  relevant  to  combating  viruses  are  needed  to  understand  the  innate  immune 
mechanisms that ultimately define bat susceptibility to viral infection. While historically such functional screens 
have  relied  on  genome-­wide  genomic  editing  (e.g.  CRISPR-­Cas9)-­  or  RNA  interference  (RNAi)-­based 
techniques, such platforms are unavailable for most bat species. Thus, new methods for uncovering functionally-­
relevant components of the bat immune response to virus infection are needed. To address this need, we have 
developed  an  innovative  arbovirus  ""rescue""  assay  wherein  immune  evasion  proteins  (IEPs)  encoded  by 
mammalian pathogens can be expressed in bat cells and one can assay for changes in bat cell susceptibility to 
arbovirus infection. Enhancement of arbovirus replication after expression of a candidate IEP indicates that the 
IEP  likely  inhibits  bat  immunity  mechanisms  that  normally  restrict  arbovirus  replication.  Using  these  IEPs  as 
""tools"",  one  can  then  identify  the  bat  immunity  factors  these  IEPs  target.  Thus,  this  screening  methodology 
provides  a  mechanism  to  both  identify  novel  IEPs  and  functionally-­relevant  components  of  the  bat  immune 
response. To discover IEPs that promote arbovirus replication in bat cells, we will screen an expression library 
encoding ~200 bacterial effector proteins. Bacterial effectors are proteins secreted by pathogenic bacteria into 
eukaryotic  hosts  cells  that  modulate  or  inhibit  various  eukaryotic  cellular  processes  to  promote  bacterial 
replication.  Many  bacterial  pathogens  that  replicate  in the  cytoplasm  of  eukaryotic  host cells  encode  effectors 
that function as IEPs. Thus, we hypothesize that some effectors may suppress immune responses that restrict 
both  bacteria  and  cytoplasmic  viruses  such  as  arboviruses.  Indeed,  our  initial  screens  have  identified  four 
effectors  that  promote  the  replication  of  four  different  arboviruses  when  expressed  in  bat  cells.  We  have 
characterized one of these effector screen ""hits"" as a novel ubiquitin ligase that targets an uncharacterized Ring

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD), with a worldwide prevalence of 50
million in 2018, will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by 2040. However, efforts to prevent, cure, or
even treat AD/ADRD have been unsuccessful. Genetic, blood, and MRI biomarkers can be used for risk
stratification, but there are limited disease-modifying options for those at high risk. Moreover, while ethnic
differences in AD/ADRD prevalence have been reported, patients of minority ethnoracial groups often receive
delayed diagnosis or inadequate treatment options. Thus, efforts are needed to identify modifiable risk factors
that could stratify the population at risk, reverse the disease course, and determine novel biomarkers for
understudied populations.
 The gut microbiota, a modifiable risk factor, has been shown to interact with the central nervous system
through the bidirectional gut-microbiota-brain axis and thus, affecting brain physiology and pathology. In this
application for a K01 award, Dr. Bernard Fongang, a Bioinformatician at the Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer's
and Neurodegenerative Diseases and the South Texas Alzheimer's disease Research Center will leverage data
from two cohorts to study the association between the gut microbiome and AD/ADRD endophenotypes. In Aim
1, he will examine whether the gut microbiota features (bacteria abundance and diversity) are related to various
neuroimaging and neurocognitive markers of AD/ADRD, using data from the Framingham Heart Study and the
Texas Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium (TARCC). In Aim 2, Dr. Fongang will assess the plasma
metabolomics profiles of these markers. Finally, in Aim 3, he will use integrative omics methods and sophisticated
mathematical models to identify the microbiota-derived metabolites related to neuroimaging and
neuropsychological markers of ADRD and how they are linked with incident AD. The large proportion of
Hispanics within the TARCC study population will also allow for examining differences by ethnicity and sex. The
results of this study will serve as the foundation for an R01 grant application, to be completed by year 3 of the
award.
 Along with funding for this innovative and important research, this K01 will provide Dr. Fongang with the
support necessary to achieve his goal of becoming an independently-funded leader in identifying novel biology
and novel drug targets to accelerate drug development for ADRD. Dr. Fongang has assembled a mentoring
team comprised of Dr. Sudha Seshadri, founding director of the Biggs Institute, as the primary mentor, and three
co-mentors: Dr. Joseph Petrosino, an expert in human microbiome; Dr. Patrick Sung, Chair of Biochemistry and
structural biology with extensive mentoring experience; and Dr. Xianlin Han, an expert in lipidomics and

10809754,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Motor functional neurological disorder (mFND), also known as conversion disorder, is a common and
disabling neuropsychiatric condition whereby individuals present with psychogenic (medically-unexplained)
motor symptoms. mFND is amongst the most common conditions seen by neurologists and neuropsychiatrists
(2nd only to headache), and $256 billion is spent annually in healthcare costs for functional disorders. Despite
the high prevalence and healthcare expense, mFND has been largely neglected by the clinical neurosciences.
Over the past decade, significant renewed interest has been catalyzed by the revised DSM-5 diagnostic criteria
emphasizing physical exam signs specific for mFND and a growing repertoire of evidence-based treatments
(e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy). Many patients present with mixed symptoms and others
initially exhibiting one symptom complex (e.g., tremor) can later develop distinct symptoms (e.g., weakness)
over the course of their illness; this emphasizes the need for a transdiagnostic research approach across the
motor spectrum of FND. In parallel, convergent structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
findings have started defining the pathophysiology of mFND, characterizing alterations within and across
salience, multimodal integration and motor control networks. Within the biopsychosocial model, adverse early-
life experiences, particularly childhood abuse, are important risk factors for developing mFND. Research in
mFND has identified that childhood abuse burden is linked to increased symptom severity, poor prognosis,
reduced insula grey matter volume, and corticolimbic functional architectural changes. Specifically, individual
differences in childhood physical abuse burden correlate with motor cortex–amygdala and motor cortex–insula
functional connectivity strength properties. These findings represent biomarkers of heighted limbic influence
over motor behavior, highlighting the importance of childhood abuse as an etiological factor.
 Building upon our prior NIMH funded research, this R01 grant proposal aims to perform multimodal
neuroimaging studies, with a longitudinal component, to neurobiologically define mFND subtypes. We also
seek to replicate our work and further characterize biomarkers predicting treatment response to standard
medical care (SMC). Aim 1 characterizes the neural signatures a high symptom severity mFND subtype, while
Aim 2 identifies the neural signatures a high childhood physical abuse mFND subtype. Aim 3 investigates how
baseline neural circuit properties relate to 6-month SMC outcomes, in addition to obtaining 6-month follow-up
MRI scans to study neural mechanisms of treatment response. These aims will be performed using
quantitative grey matter volumetry, resting-state functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging, with the latter two
approaches leveraging graph theory. The long-term objectives of this research are to identify neurobiological
mFND subtypes that will guide prognosis and treatment selection, as well as aid the development of new
therapeutics through an improved pathophysiological understanding of this disabling neuropsychiatric disorder."
10768762,"Project summary: Early evidence indicates an association between emotional (eudaimonic and hedonic) well-
being (EWB) and underlying brain processes, and that those processes change with both normal and
pathological brain aging. However, the nature of these associations, the mechanisms by which EWB and its
component domains change with brain aging, and how those changes may be associated with common
neuropathologies like Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), are largely unexplored. The objective
of the Network for Emotional Well-being and Brain Aging (NEW Brain Aging) is to address priority area #2 –
mechanistic research on the role of emotional well-being in health – of RFA-AT-20-003, identifying and testing
mechanisms by which brain aging influences EWB and how EWB may impact risk for and progression of ADRD.
Synthesizing human and animal literature, our premise is that relationships between EWB and ADRD are
bidirectional – normal and pathological changes in aging brain influence EWB and EWB contributes to brain
health and illness, such as ADRD. Further, we hypothesize that the relationships between EWB and the brain
in older adults reflect aging-associated heterogeneity of brain (i.e., resilience, typical aging, or neuropathological
changes), and that they are mediated by processes of appraisal and adaptation. To do so we will form a national,
transdisciplinary collaborative that includes investigators representing research expertise in human and animal
neuroimaging, stress regulation, ADRD research, EWB, and computational/quantitative methods. With direction
of an Executive Committee and guided by an External Advisory Committee, NEW Brain Aging will undertake
these specific aims: (1) To build an inter-university and transdisciplinary collaborative of senior and junior
investigators interested in brain, aging, and EWB research from both human and animal fields; (2) To form a
series of time-limited workgroups with relevant experts in the field, each working over 1-2 years, to establish
priorities for NEW Brain Aging activities in each of three general areas: (a) brain mechanism research of EWB;
(b) research of EWB’s impact on ADRD; and (c) translational animal and cross-species brain research methods;
(3) To coalesce and coordinate resources to ensure the rigor and reproducibility of the brain-related EWB
research; (4) To provide three types of pilot funding through rigorous peer review: (a) pilot research grants for
junior faculty related to brain mechanism studies related to the relationship between EWB and dementia using
human or animal models; (b) proof-of-concept grants for established investigators to test aspects related to EWB
in their existing studies and cohorts of brain aging; (c) seed collaboration grants for cross-species brain research
related to EWB; (5) To evaluate the network by tracking its activities, resource usage, and productivity, and
conducting collaborative network density analysis throughout the 4-year grant; and (6) to ensure the wide
dissemination of NEW Brain Aging products. By accomplishing these aims, we will strengthen a research
network focusing on the brain mechanistic understanding of EWB and relationship between EWB and ADRD."

Social connectedness, the relationship people have with others, contributes to thriving in nursing homes.
Loneliness is prevalent in nursing homes, and more so in residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (ADRD). In the community, loneliness spreads through a contagious process. Nursing homes provide
congregate living for older adults where such spread of loneliness has not been studied. The proposed R01
explores the longitudinal evolution of lack of social connectedness throughout the nursing home stay, describes
the interdependence of social isolation and lack of social connectedness within congregate living environments,
and identify individual and contextual factors that exacerbate or attenuate its spread. Understanding who is at
risk for lack of social connectedness and the health consequences of “being alone in a crowd” will inform
interventions to address this important determinant of health and well-being in nursing home residents. The
importance of this R01 is underscored by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nursing home residents.
Necessary policies introduced unprecedented social disruption to nursing homes (e.g., no visitors, residents
restricted to their rooms), coupled with devastating COVID-19 illnesses and deaths leaving no resident, loved
one, or nursing home staff unaffected. The horrific COVID-19 “natural experiment” allows the study of the
downstream ripple effects of the policies to contain COVID-19 in nursing homes on social isolation and
connectedness. The proposed R01 builds from our novel NIH-funded work to develop and test indices of social
connectedness and social isolation using the Minimum Data Set 3.0 (MDS). We leverage an in-house
longitudinal national MDS-based data source (2011-2018, extended to 2021) which includes area-based and
facility characteristics, COVID-19 related data (e.g., policies, cases, deaths), and Medicare eligibility and claims
data. These data enable the evaluation of deaths, hospitalizations and other validated outcomes. Our specific
aims are to: 1) Extend our social connectedness/isolation MDS measure development and testing to residents
without ADRD; 2) Evaluate the “natural course” of social connectedness in nursing homes and identify individual
and contextual factors that modulate its spread; 3) Quantify the effect of social connectedness and isolation on
health outcomes and evaluate factors that moderate its impact; 4) Estimate the impact of the pandemic on the
lack of social connectedness in nursing home residents and the corresponding ripple effects of lack of social
connectedness on resident health and well-being; 5) Identify characteristics of nursing homes that altered the
impact of COVID-19 on the lack of social connectedness and its associated health effects among residents. The
project develops a knowledge base regarding the broader impact of social isolation and COVID-19 on outcomes
in nursing homes. The research will inform policies for the care of a rapidly growing segment of an aging society
and guidance nursing home pandemic preparedness."

 Over the past half century scientists have learned much about how cells detect hormones, nutrients

transduced by a chemical second messenger, such as cAMP or calcium. Our lab has long focused on the
identification and characterization of feedback regulators, most notably RGS proteins. Whereas receptors
activate G proteins, RGS proteins inactivate G proteins through accelerated GTP hydrolysis.
 In the next five years our lab will focus on the identification and characterization of novel second
messengers and their roles in two aspects of signal coordination. The first is focused on signal coordination by
a pheromone GPCR and by another GPCR that detects nutrients. The second is how the pheromone GPCR
regulates nutrient availability, through autophagy and the recycling of molecular building blocks.
 This new initiative builds on our discovery that G proteins regulate, and are regulated by, physiological
changes in intracellular pH and of 2-hydroxy branched chain amino acids. These metabolites are second
messengers of glucose limitation and osmotic stress, respectively, and share the ability to trigger G protein
phosphorylation and inactivation.
 Our overall approach is to systematically determine the effects of stimulating (pharmacologically) the cell,
deleting (genetically) signaling pathway components, measuring (NMR and mass spectrometry) changes in
cellular proteins and metabolites, reconstituting (biochemically) the activity of G proteins and effector kinases,
and solving (x-ray and NMR) the structures of second messengers bound to their physiological targets.
 If successful, our research program will lead to the identification of novel second messengers, their
mechanism of action, and their functional consequences in the cell. Our investigations will require the
implementation of multiple research platforms and strategies, and thus benefit greatly from the flexibility and
stability provided by the MIRA program."

 This proposal is for a mentored patient-oriented research career development award for Dr. Shawniqua
Williams Roberson, Assistant Professor of Neurology and Bioengineering at Vanderbilt University Medical
Center. Dr. Williams Roberson's long-term goal is to establish an independent research career using EEG
signal processing techniques to study the neurobiology and neurophysiological indicators of ICU delirium and
post-ICU cognitive impairment and dementia, a potentially devastating disorder recognized and funded under
the Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) for which older adults are at highest risk. To
accomplish this, her objectives during the period of this award are: (1) to develop expertise in the design and
implementation of patient-oriented clinical research studies in ICU delirium and post-ICU dementia; (2) to gain
experience in the assessment of cognitive function as an outcome measure; and (3) to develop the scientific
communication, grant writing and leadership skills to support a successful career as an independent
researcher. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are objective EEG-based signatures of ICU
delirium that predict patterns of post-ICU cognitive impairment and dementia. The specific aims are (1) to
characterize quantitatively the resting-state EEG signatures associated with ICU delirium in older adults and
(2) to determine the relationship between EEG signatures during recovery from critical illness and post-ICU
cognitive performance in this population. The proposed studies will yield critical information to advance our
understanding of the neurobiology underlying delirium and its evolution to post-ICU ADRD by informing
development of a novel delirium monitoring tool for the ICU and identifying EEG predictors of ADRD in
survivors. The results will be used to inform a subsequent R01 validating an EEG-based index of ICU delirium
and a prediction model for post-ICU ADRD. The project will be conducted in the Critical Illness, Brain
Dysfunction and Survivorship (CIBS) Center and will allow the PI to capitalize on guidance from a world-class
mentoring team. Dr. E. Wesley Ely, a renowned expert in clinical research in aging and critical care populations
will be primary mentor and supervise the clinical research methodology. Dr. James C. Jackson, a world leader
in neurocognitive outcomes research, will guide the conduct, analysis and interpretation of cognitive
assessments. Dr. Mayur Patel, PI of multiple ongoing NIH-funded studies investigating long-term outcomes
after critical care, will oversee professional development in scientific communication, grant writing and
leadership. This project will thus provide a platform for Dr. Williams Roberson to establish preliminary data and
clinical research skills to launch an independent research career at the intersection of critical illness, cognitive
neuroscience, engineering and clinical neurophysiology, where she is uniquely poised to make a durable
impact for ICU survivors."

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a debilitating disorder resulting from cardiovascular autonomic
dysfunction, has many causes and is very difficult to treat effectively. This renewal proposal builds on the
work that supports a pathophysiological role for functional adrenergic autoantibodies in POTS. The
differing allosteric effects of these antibodies on the natural ligands provide an explanation for increased
sympathetic activity and exaggerated orthostatic tachycardia characteristic of POTS. However, the
mechanism for decreased parasympathetic activity in POTS patients is yet to be elucidated. This
proposal tests the hypothesis that muscarinic autoantibody-mediated parasympathetic dysfunction
contributes to the pathogenesis of POTS, and that parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation improves POTS
symptoms, autoimmunity and inflammation. The long-term goal is to evaluate the significance of
autoimmune-mediated sympathovagal imbalance in the pathophysiology of POTS and to establish
transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) as a safe and effective treatment option for POTS. The
specific aims are to: 1) determine the prevalence, burden, and clinical significance of muscarinic
autoantibodies in a well-phenotyped cohort of POTS patients and a matched cohort of healthy control
subjects; 2) examine the in vivo impact of muscarinic autoantibodies on cardiovagal activity in a rabbit
autoimmune model developed during the current funding period; and 3) investigate the potential
therapeutic mechanisms of tVNS in POTS patients and in animal model. tVNS is an important treatment
modality that needs to cross the translational bridge between basic science and clinical research.
Findings from these studies will provide realistic expectation of new knowledge regarding the etiology of
this disabling disorder and lay the foundation for a paradigm shift for the treatment of POTS."

The overarching research goal of the Park lab is to gain systems-level understanding of
metabolism (including its regulation) and rationally engineer mammalian and microbial
metabolism for biotechnology and medicine. We are a team of open-minded and hardworking
researchers who employ core analytical techniques and ceaselessly innovate (and adopt) new
technologies to solve challenging problems associated with various diseases and organisms.
Our current research is twofold: microbial conversion of carbon dioxide into value-add products
for economic and environmental benefits; and elucidation of thermodynamic and kinetic mode of
metabolic control in mammalian gluconeogenesis. One of our goals over the next five years is to
develop key technologies to mathematically reconstruct human central carbon metabolism in
thermodynamic and kinetic terms. Until recently, characterization of metabolism has relied
mainly on comparison of relative metabolite and enzyme levels between control and
experimental groups. We will go beyond measuring just the “levels” and quantify rates and
energies, which are direct representation of metabolism in action yet difficult to measure
because they are substantive yet intangible. To this end, we will employ state-of-the-art liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry, mathematical modeling, and novel isotope tracers that can
yield the most thermodynamic and kinetic information in cellular metabolism. We aim to apply
these techniques to investigating the two central metabolic pathways: glycolysis and
gluconeogenesis. The two pathways largely share a common enzyme set, yet the former
converts glucose into cellular energy and biomass precursors while the latter converts non-
carbohydrate substrates into glucose. These functionally opposite metabolic pathways support
systemic glucose homeostasis in humans and, in microbes, various bioproduct synthesis from a
wide range of carbon substrates with varying degrees of oxidation. This project will map kinetic
and thermodynamic bottlenecks of the two pathways in mammalian cells and elucidate
regulatory mechanisms that enable seamless transitions and coordination between them. As
dysregulation of these pathways are implicated in type II diabetes and cancer, we envision that
this research program will lead to effective metabolic control and engineering strategies to
remedy defective carbon metabolism in diseases. The upshot of successfully completing the
proposed research will contribute to advancing therapeutic development for diabetes and
cancer."
10889031,"Project Summary - Toxin secretion and trafficking by Mycobacterium tuberculosis
The ability to control the timing and mode of host cell death plays a pivotal role in microbial infections. Most
pathogenic bacteria use toxins to evade and/or subvert immune responses, to survive and replicate in the host.
CpnT is an outer membrane protein with an N-terminal channel domain and a C-terminal toxin domain (TNT),
which causes necrotic cell death in host cells. Up-to-date TNT is the only known exotoxin of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis. We showed that TNT is secreted into the cytosol of macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis
where it hydrolyzes NAD+. NAD+ depletion by TNT activates necroptosis, a programmed cell death pathway.
Importantly, necroptosis-deficient mice are more resistent to infection with M. tuberculosis, underlining the
importance of this pathway for tuberculosis pathogenesis. Permeabilization of the phagosomal membrane is a
critical step in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis, not only because it required for M. tuberculosis proteins
such as the toxin TNT to reach the cytosol of infected cells, but it also enables M. tuberculosis to escape from
the phagosome resulting in bacterial dissemination. Thus, TNT secretion and trafficking are an important
components of the intracellular survival strategy of M. tuberculosis and for tuberculosis pathogenesis. This
research project will reveal novel molecular mechanisms of toxin secretion and trafficking by M. tuberculosis
and the role of these mechanisms in virulence and pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis."

 My goal is to develop effective and efﬁcient computational methods for drug discovery, apply these
methods to ﬁnd new and efﬁcacious drugs to treat diseases, and deploy these methods in easy-to-use open
source tools. My research group pioneered the development and integration of deep neural networks in
user-friendly molecular docking software for structure-based drug design to predict poses and potency of
small molecules binding to their molecular targets. We will build on our foundational work by using deep
learning to simultaneously solving the scoring and sampling problems, which will overcome scalability
limitations inherent in current approaches.
 We propose to develop the ﬁrst deep generative models for structure-based drug design. Unlike tra-
ditional screening, generative modeling is not limited to a predeﬁned chemical space. In generative mod-
eling, a deep neural network learns an underlying distribution of molecular structures and properties
represented as a latent space. New structures can be extracted from this learned latent space to have
desirable properties. Ideally, a generative model will produce novel, near-optimal molecular structures
almost instantaneously. We hypothesize that training generative models using existing 3D protein and
ligand structures will allow us to create general models that can be productively applied to new, struc-
turally enabled targets due to the richness and universality of protein-ligand interactions. We will further
develop these methods to support the generation of optimized lead candidates, where the generative
process is updated to include results from experimental assays as the drug discovery process progresses.
 We will continually apply our methods to identify small molecule modulators of molecular interac-
tions relevant to normal physiology and disease. For example, using our current tools, we identiﬁed the
ﬁrst inhibitors of the proﬁlin-actin interaction, an anti-angiogenesis target with relevance to cancer and
diabetic retinopathy, and we plan to further improve these compounds with the goal of identifying candi-
dates for clinical testing. We will apply our methods to address other under-explored molecular targets,
such as NFATc2, which is implicated in cancer and autoimmune diseases. These prospective applications
of our methods will provide unbiased and realistic evaluations that further inform their development.
 Finally, all of our code and trained deep neural network models will be deployed either as new tools
for generative modeling or as enhancements to our widely used open source tools for computational drug
discovery: (1) PHARMIT, an interactive web application for structure-based drug discovery; (2) GNINA,
a C/C++ deep learning framework for molecular docking; and (3) the newly released LIBMOLGRID, a
Python library for accelerated molecular gridding that integrates with popular deep learning toolkits.
These tools and methods will make the drug discovery process more accessible and efﬁcient."

Human craniofacial development is a complex process and frequently goes awry to cause a major class of
birth defects, orofacial clefting, which affects approximately 1 in 700 live births. Proper facial development in
mouse and human requires three sets of paired facial prominences coming together by growth,
morphogenesis, and fusion. Embryonic facial development is strikingly similar in human and mouse, making
the mouse the best available model system for human. Previous studies have shown that the expression of
many thousands of genes changes across tissue layer, age, and/or prominence, as well as cell population
during early mouse facial development. However, we still only have a rudimentary understanding of how these
changes are regulated by the interaction of transcriptional modulators in the developing face. To understand
how genes are transcriptionally regulated during facial development, this research seeks to construct
transcriptional regulatory networks in a temporospatial manner by in silico analysis of publicly available multi-
omic datasets. Aim 1 will focus on the identification and verification of transcriptional regulatory networks
operating in facial mesenchyme with a focus on super-enhancers. Aim 2 will adopt a similar approach to study
the ectoderm which acts as a vital signaling center for the mesenchyme. Finally, in Aim 3 I will apply
knowledge from Aims 1 and 2 to build transcriptional regulatory networks at the single cell level. These aims
will take advantage of available RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, histone marker ChIP-seq, transcription factor ChIP-seq,
bulk and single cell RNA-seq data from wild-type or mutant mice, as well as facial enhancer expression
databases. Accomplishment of these studies will predict how genes are transcriptionally regulated in a
temporospatial manner during facial development and discover sets of core transcription factors and super-
enhancers controlling facial development. These transcriptional regulatory networks will be relevant to the
genetic and molecular underpinnings of human orofacial clefting, and will provide clear testable predictions
about transcription factor function and the consequences of aberrant expression. Performance and
accomplishment of these Aims will also act as a major component of my career development plan, in which my
goal is to obtain and independent tenure-track faculty position and serve as a mentor to the next generation of
scientists. A major aspect of my career development plan is to build on my growing strength in bioinformatics
by learning more advanced techniques in this specialty alongside new computational based approaches, such
as machine learning. In this respect, my Aims and career development plan are aligned with a Notice of
Special Interest (NOSI) of NIDCR in Supporting Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research Using Bioinformatic,
Computational, and Data Science Approaches (NOT-DE-20-006) for which this application is targeted. I have
recruited a mentorship team with specialties in craniofacial biology, bioinformatics, machine learning, and
career development to help me achieve these goals."

Candidate: Paula Chatterjee, MD MPH is an early stage health services researcher and general internist
interested in improving access to care for rural older adults and narrowing rural-urban health disparities. She
aims to develop content expertise in aging; expand her mixed method research skills; and transition into an
independent investigator dedicated to improving the health of older adults and narrowing health disparities.
Research Context: Older adults make up a growing portion of rural communities in the United States (US),
but have more chronic conditions and limited access to care compared to their urban counterparts. Rural
hospitals, which increasingly provide essential inpatient and outpatient care for older adults, struggle financially
and are at accelerating risk of closure. Global budgets for rural hospitals have been proposed as a strategy to
financially bolster rural hospitals to stave off risks of closure, while transforming rural care delivery to optimally
manage chronic conditions and narrow rural-urban health disparities. Understanding how global budgets might
achieve these outcomes is critically important to understanding how to strengthen rural health care systems.
Specific Aims: (1) Describe trends in access to care, chronic condition management, and corresponding rural-
urban disparities among older adults in the US; (2) estimate changes in access to care, chronic condition
management, and rural-urban disparities among older adults after the introduction of global budgets for rural
hospitals; and (3) qualitatively
chronic
identify hospital-based facilitators and barriers to preserving access, improving
condition management, and narrowing disparities for rural older adults.
Research Plan: Using the Health and Retirement Study and Medicare claims, Dr. Chatterjee will first describe
trends in access to care and chronic condition management, and then use a synthetic control approach to
evaluate the association between the introduction of global budgets in rural Pennsylvania hospitals and these
outcomes. Dr. Chatterjee will then collect primary data from rural Pennsylvania hospital executives to better
understand their efforts to preserve access, improve chronic condition management, and narrow disparities.
Career Development Plan: Dr. Chatterjee will (1) develop content expertise in aging and health care delivery
for older adults, particularly those in rural communities; (2) broaden and solidify research skills in causal
inference, qualitative methods and implementation science; and (3) execute a research agenda focused on
improving the health of older adults with chronic conditions. She will achieve these goals under a team of
leading experts in aging, rural health, health disparities, econometrics, and qualitative methods.
Environment: The University of Pennsylvania is an ideal environment to achieve these training aims under the
guidance of an experienced and multidisciplinary team of Mentors and Advisors with a strong track record in
developing independent health services researchers in aging and health services research."

 Selective Functionalization of Aliphatic Amines and Derivatives
Aliphatic amines are ubiquitous among pharmaceutical compounds, driving significant research into the
synthesis and functionalization of molecules bearing nitrogen atoms. Traditional strategies use functional group
handles to synthesize amines. We have been engaged in a research program that uses resident C-H bonds
and transforms them directly into the functionality of interest. The central challenge to derivatizing amines,
thus, was one of positional selectivity. A number of strategies were advanced in the previous funding period
with broad success.
In the next funding period, we will expand the repertoire of reactions, the positions of activation and the
complementarity to existing methods. We will develop methods to arylate C-H bonds in aliphatic amines, to
difunctionalize vicinal C-H bonds in analogy to olefin difunctionalization, again with complete positional
selectivity and to use earth abundant metal salts to activate distal C-H bonds of amines. Complementary
approaches will be aimed at providing a method to functionalize inaccessible C-H bonds on tertiary amines,
common components of many FDA approved drugs. These will allow structural diversification of complex
molecules as well as a structural editing approach to provide homologous scaffolds to bioactive molecules.
Lastly, primary amines are surprisingly widely available, far more so than alkyl halides or even carboxylic
acids, no doubt due to the ubiquity and importance of amide bond constructions. We will develop a
complementary strategy that will use the C-N bond as a functional group handle in cross-coupling chemistry.
All of these methods are designed to facilitate drug design and discovery in the pursuit of more efficacious
treatments for human diseases.
The specific goals of this research are as follows:
 1) Site-Selective Remote Functionalization of Aliphatic Amines
 2) Selective α-Functionalization of Tertiary Alkylamines
 3) Deaminative Functionalization of Primary Amines

CORE B: Behavioral Economics and Intervention Science (BEIS) Core
 The Vermont Center on Behavior and Health (VCBH) is a multidisciplinary research center located at the
University of Vermont (UVM) that investigates relationships between personal behavior and risk for chronic
disease and premature death. The overarching aim of the VCBH Behavioral Economics and Intervention Science
(BEIS) Core is to provide investigators with scientific and technical expertise and research infrastructure in the
three key areas of Decision Making, Intervention Sciences, and Economic Modeling. We propose that Stacey
Sigmon, PhD continue as BEIS Core Director. Our Decision-Making team has administered 1,192
comprehensive executive function batteries to 700 participants in studies led by 10 VCBH investigators, ranging
from efforts to understand executive function among dysregulated children, loss aversion and delay discounting
among smokers to factors underlying variability in response to interventions to manage type 1 diabetes in young
people. Our Intervention Sciences Module has supported studies evaluating novel behavioral and
pharmacological interventions in vulnerable populations, including interventions to treat PTSD among patients
with OUD, engagement in cardiac rehabilitation following myocardial infarction, smoking cessation among
pregnant women, utilization of contraceptive services by women with OUD, and technology-assisted interim
buprenorphine dosing for individuals with OUD. The BEIS Economic Modeling team has supported investigators
in examining the behavioral economic principles underlying problematic drinking among college students, cost
savings from telehealth screening for diabetic retinopathy, the economic impact of sudden unexpected infant
death, cost-effectiveness of onsite contraceptive services for women at risk for unintended pregnancy, financial
incentives for smoking-cessation among pregnant women, and adherence to cardiac rehabilitation after
myocardial infarction. Taken together, we are confident that continuation and further development of this core’s
dedicated service modules and teams will contribute considerably to ensure the impact and sustainability of
VCBH in advancing scientific knowledge and improving clinical care in behavioral health at local, national, and
international levels."

an immense financial burden on the healthcare system. The Vermont Center on Behavior and Health (VCBH) is
dedicated to improving U.S. public health by investigating processes underpinning these unhealthy behavior
patterns and developing and disseminating/implementing efficacious and cost-effective behavior-change
interventions. The overarching aim of this Phase 3 Pilot Project Program is to strategically build upon progress
made in Phases 1 and 2 in establishing VCBH as a sustainable center of research excellence. The proposed
Pilot Project Program will invite proposals for Pilot Project applications on a rolling basis. The Pilot Project
Program will prioritize collaborative research that builds upon five current VCBH research strengths: (1) tobacco
regulatory science, (2) tobacco control, (3) rural addiction crisis, (4) cardiopulmonary research, and (5) studies
of neurobiological development and risk. Applications will be rigorously evaluated to identify meritorious projects
with the greatest potential for impact and funding. Among meritorious applications, priority will be given to early-
career investigators and those that utilize VCBH cores. Early-career investigators will receive comprehensive
mentorship from VCBH senior investigators adhering to practices established in COBRE Phases 1 and 2. Pilot
Project Leaders will be encouraged to collaborate with ongoing VCBH themed working groups established
around these five areas of VCBH scientific strength to plan for collaborative NIH proposals in the R series and
P01 and center grants applications. We will also be vigilant regarding opportunities to seed new research
directions that align with the VCBH mission. Overall, the proposed Pilot Project Program will be critically
important to sustaining VCBH productivity, early-career mentoring, and generating the preliminary data
necessary for competitive NIH and other grant applications, all essential to firmly situating VCBH on a

The HIV-1 Vif protein is expressed late during infection and has a well-described function to ubiquitinate and
degrade proteins in the APOBEC3 family, thus neutralizing their antiviral activities. More recently, an additional
function of HIV-1 Vif was described by us and others to ubiquitinate and degrade protein phosphatase 2A
holoenzymes containing B56 family regulatory subunits (PP2A-B56). The conservation of Vif-mediated PP2A-
B56 degradation throughout globally circulating HIV-1 subtypes suggests that it is functionally important.
However, there remains a gap in understanding the mechanisms by which PP2A-B56 degradation confers a
fitness advantage to HIV-1. Furthermore, in contrast to APOBEC3 degradation, the host cellular determinants
required for Vif-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of PP2A-B56 are undefined.
In this project, we aim to address these gaps in understanding by defining the cellular determinants and functional
effects of PP2A-B56 degradation by HIV-1 Vif. In Aim 1, we will apply unbiased protein interaction technologies
to determine proteins interacting with PP2A-B56 while it is degraded by Vif. In Aim 2, we will carry out a genome-
wide CRISPR/Cas9 genetic screen to identify genes regulating APOBEC3 and PP2A-B56 degradation. In Aim
3, will test the impact of individual phosphorylation sites regulated by PP2A-B56 in HIV-1 replication in primary
CD4+ T cells. Successful completion of this project will advance understanding of the Vif-PP2A-B56 signaling
axis, potentially leading towards the development of novel classes of antiretroviral therapies that target late
processes of HIV-1 infection."

HIV is a leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), but rates of new infections in declining. As a result,
some HIV services are becoming less efficient: HIV prevention is averting fewer infections per client served, and
HIV testing yield (i.e., the fraction of tests leading to new diagnoses) is declining. Given resource constraints,
HIV prevention and testing programs will need to increase efficiency in order to maintain momentum toward
epidemic control. Specifically, a precision public health approach could be used to focus services where their
health benefits would be greatest. Precision public health has been challenging to implement in SSA’s
generalized HIV epidemics because most transmission is not confined to identifiable key populations, eluding
precise responses. Until recently, the only tool for describing HIV transmission has been phylogenetic analysis
of HIV genome sequences, which is too slow and costly for real-time response at scale. Rapid tests for recent
HIV infection (RTRI) recently became available in SSA, offering a novel opportunity to identify active transmission
clusters and respond with precision. RTRI detects high-avidity antibodies that appear approximately one year
after HIV infection. If only low-avidity antibodies are detected, this infection likely occurred in the past year.
Zambia is an early adopter of RTRI and followed-up two-thirds of positive HIV tests with RTRI in 2021. Despite
the large scale of Zambia’s RTRI program, it has not been evaluated in terms of impact or cost-effectiveness,
and outbreak response thresholds have not been optimized. However, the wealth of data now collected by the
RTRI program could guide higher-performing, next-generation outbreak response strategies. Our team has
expertise in Zambian HIV policy, program implementation, health economics, bioethics, geospatial analysis,
machine learning, and infectious disease modeling. We helped to develop the only HIV social network model
rigorously validated to predict HIV incidence, prevalence, and transmission patterns in SSA, which has been
used for international and country-level HIV policy decision-making for over a decade. We propose to partner
with the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ), a Zambian-run NGO that has been
supporting MoH for over a decade in HIV policy-making and implementation (including RTRI), to (Aim 1)
determine whether the RTRI program can help Zambia achieve its epidemic control goals, (Aim 2) measure the
cost and estimate the cost-effectiveness of the RTRI program, and (Aim 3) use “big data” methods to design
next-generation outbreak responses, taking into account trade-offs of sensitivity vs. specificity, precision vs.
ease-of-use, and precision vs. avoidance of collecting potentially stigmatizing data elements. While pursuing
scientific Aims and hypotheses aligned with the NOSI “Harnessing Big Data to Halt HIV”, we will also have direct
policy impact by providing real-time analytics, HIV outbreak mapping, and input for RTRI policy decision-making."

The long-term goal of this research program is to uncover the transcriptional and posttranscriptional
mechanisms coordinating the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression during mammalian embryonic
lens development and differentiation. Despite the simple composition of the lens that contains only two
mature cell types, the full range and spectrum of mechanisms and pathways governing lens gene
expression remain to be identified. A hallmark feature of lens development and cellular differentiation is
the temporally and spatially regulated expression of a- and b-/g-crystallins required for lens structure,
homeostasis and transparency. This application seeks to identify novel cis-acting DNA regulatory sites
and novel RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that regulate the expression of mammalian crystallins in vivo
during lens differentiation. We have now linked the expression of the bB3-crystallin gene in the lens with in
vivo binding of transcription factor Pax6 to its “open” promoter chromatin domain in lens enabling
prediction of novel cis-acting sites and transcription factors and their posttranslational modifications
(PTMs) that spatially and temporally control its expression. We have also discovered transient nuclear
accumulation of spliced Crybb3 mRNAs in early lens fiber cell nuclei along with multiple spatially and
temporally regulated RBPs that likely regulate bB3- and other crystallin mRNAs transport, stability,
translation and decay. These general mechanisms control expression of other lens-specific genes making
their discovery an essential first step towards understanding both transcriptional and posttranscriptional
regulatory mechanisms underlying lens differentiation. To test our predictions, Aim 1 is designed to
uncover the lens-specific cis-regulatory grammar regulating the mouse Crybb3 as a model crystallin. Aim
2 is designed to examine posttranscriptional regulation of lens gene expression by identifying novel RBPs
and their sites in crystallin mRNAs particularly within their 3’-UTRs, determining function of identified
differentiation-regulated RBPs, and employing a state-of-art MS2-MCP system to in vivo track individual
crystallin mRNAs from their birth in the nucleus throughout their nuclear export and localization in the vast
space of lens fiber cells at single molecule resolution. These results will reveal those mechanisms linking
a-, b/g-crystallin mRNA regulation, identify novel and diverse RBPs that interact with crystallin mRNAs,
establish molecular mechanisms of Crybb3 transcription, and provide new insights into the 3D-distribution
of individual crystallin mRNAs in lens fiber cells at specific stages of lens cell differentiation. Together,
these studies will generate transformative insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms required for
mammalian lens morphogenesis, transparency and refraction and provide a basis for comprehensive
understanding of gene expression in more complex tissues in and outside of the eye."

The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic dramatically altered healthcare delivery in persistent ways.
To adhere to the physical distancing guidelines and to provide continuity of patient care, organizations shifted
the primary modality of ambulatory care to telemedicine-based virtual encounters. This transition has altered the
structure, management, and delivery of patient care—with large potential changes to patient-provider
communication and availability of clinical information. For example, during telemedicine encounters clinicians
can no longer conduct physical exams or obtain vitals that inform clinical reasoning and decision making in
routine ambulatory evaluation and management (E&M) encounters. In turn, these factors may contribute to
clinical uncertainty, and thereby alter how the clinician leverages the electronic health record (EHR). They may
need to engage in additional chart review to fill information gaps, enter patient-generated health data, or send
more follow-up communications. One or more of these changes serves to intensify EHR-based cognitive load
as EHR activities and activity switching increase, both at the encounter level and cumulatively over the course
of a workday. In turn, greater EHR-based cognitive load could contribute to suboptimal clinical decisions (e.g.,
more diagnostic tests or referrals) and more errors (e.g., wrong-patient orders).
In the proposed Assessing the Effect of Telemedicine on Physician EHR Work, Cognition, and Process
Outcomes (ASPIRE) project, we investigate the primary hypothesis that ambulatory telemedicine encounters in
the COVID context are associated with increased EHR-based cognitive load among clinicians, and downstream
suboptimal clinical decisions and more frequent errors. We leverage novel, EHR-based audit log data from a 3-
year period spanning pre- and COVID-periods (March 2019 – February 2022) to directly measure clinicians' EHR
activities in telemedicine and face-to-face encounters at two large academic medical centers (Washington
University in St Louis and University of California, San Francisco). Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a natural
experiment that dramatically increased ambulatory telemedicine encounters (more than 25-fold at the two health
systems), our first aim will characterize the differences in EHR-based activities between face-to-face and
telemedicine encounters. We will then construct a derivative measure of EHR activity switches (within and across
encounters) as a proxy measure of cognitive load and evaluate the downstream impact of cognitive load on
clinical decision making and wrong-patient errors. The findings from these aims will be leveraged in our final
“design” aim that uses frontline clinician interviews and a national expert eDelphi process to elicit the EHR-based
factors impacting telemedicine encounters and to identify potential design strategies to address associated
challenges. The eDelphi process will focus on translating and prioritizing the identified design strategies into
pragmatic goals to improve EHR support for telemedicine encounters."
10840298,"Mucosa are sites of conventional immune system attack for defense against invasive pathogens. Mucosa
were also once regarded simply as inert barriers preventing commensal microbes from accessing sterile
tissues. Instead, emerging evidence suggests a complex interplay between commensal microbes, barrier
epithelial cells, and the immune system that is essential for local and systemic homeostasis of the host.
We have recently provided insight into how recognition of commensal components by epithelial and innate
immune cells triggers a specific immune reaction and why the nature of this reaction could foster host-
microbe symbiosis instead of outright microbial rejection. Specifically, we showed that antigen acquisition
be intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) of commensal antigens drives a non-pathogenic commensal Th17 cell
response. Here we propose to mechanistically examine the fate of intracellular IEC antigens and the role
of IECs in the process, as well as the phenotype and function of the generated Th17 cells. We will address
these mechanism by pursuing two specific aims to explore 1) Role of IECs in priming of commensal T cell
responses and 2) Generation and function of anti-inflammatory commensal Th17 cells. Our studies
address fundamental mechanisms of mucosal immunity to commensal microbes and if successful will
provide novel mechanisms of IEC function, as well as pathways for generation of protective mucosal T cell
responses."
