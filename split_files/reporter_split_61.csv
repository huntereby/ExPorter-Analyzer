10902081,"ABSTRACT: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
We seek support to expand our NW NARCH program, building upon successful experience with our earlier
rounds of NARCH funding for various research and trainee development projects. We bring many years of
collaborative experiences to the NARCH—including collaborations among Northwest Portland Area Indian
Health Board, OHSU, and Portland State University. Our Administrative core will help facilitate activities
among the three partners, and is organized to support the overall success of the Northwest NARCH.
Our Administrative Core’s specific aims include the following:
1. To provide administrative leadership and oversight for the component NARCH 12 projects
 described in this application and align these activities with existing NARCH training and
 research projects;
2. To provide process and outcome evaluations for component projects within our NARCH 12 application;
3. To report NARCH progress to the delegates from the 43 NW tribes, to national NARCH project officers,
 to upper level administrators (deans and provosts) at the partner universities, and to Community and
 Scientific Advisors;
4. To seek out and disseminate information to collaborators on research and training opportunities for
 investigators, mentors, and students; and
5. To support investigators’ travel to the annual NARCH director meetings and scientific meetings.
Our Administrative Core is designed to efficiently and effectively serve needs of the component NARCH
projects that are described in this application. The PI and NARCH program investigators will be guided by the
Community and Scientific Advisory Board, who are well known to the Indian Health Board and to the NARCH
program. Members of this panel served the NARCH in earlier rounds, and are either American Indian
community health experts, scientific experts related to Indian health—or both. They have provided their input
for this application, and are as excited as we are to see us implement our projects. Our projects are in direct
alignment with NARCH program goals, and with the NIH Strategic Plan for Tribal Health Research FY 2019-
2023. We trust that our efforts will serve the tribes in our region, and beyond."
10902083,"The overall goal of this project is to increase the number of well-trained AI/AN researchers who are
prepared to conduct population health sciences research in diverse settings. Numerous authors have
documented the small numbers of tribal people who are career research scientists. Our efforts are aimed at
addressing this situation. For this proposed fellowship program, we will build on our successful record of
research career development for graduate students that we implemented in the previous cycles of NARCH
funding. We will continue to support AI/AN graduate students for their mentored research, prioritizing NW
tribal students enrolled in NW institutions. In addition, building on seven years of NIH support through the
national BUILD program, we will support undergraduate AI/AN students interested in population science
careers at Portland State University and other regional colleges and universities (new activity) as they
undertake and complete mentored research projects. While all students will complete their programs’
degree requirements for graduation, we will increase trainee research competencies by additionally offering
a mixture of skill-building courses in our Summer Research Training Institute program, via regularly
scheduled Zoom and web-based seminars, in-person workshops, through near-peer mentorship, and by
providing support to attend national, regional, and local research conferences.
Using a population health sciences ’lens’, our fellowship program proposal includes the following aims:
 1. Recruit and retain AI/AN graduate students in population health sciences into our research fellowships,
 in collaboration with NW college and university training programs and via national Indian education
 foundations and organizations (AIESES) (Latter is new activity)
2. Recruit and retain AI/AN undergraduate students interested in population health sciences and support
 them for research activities undertaken at their institutions (new activity for our NARCH).
3. Support development of all trainees via mentored research projects, Zoom-based seminars, and in-
 person workshops to foster research skills, and by providing AI/AN role models, near-peer mentors,
 and support for participation in national scientific meetings.
4. Evaluate the success of the project and track the trainees as they progress in their careers.
The end product of our efforts should serve the national agenda to build tribal research capacity and reduce
health disparities that currently separate tribal from non-Native groups in the U.S. In addition, our training
efforts directed at regional AI/AN students will help establish NPAIHB as an important regional resource for
tribal health research in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho."
10902085,"ABSTRACT - Forging our Futures: Studying Science to Protect Tribal Health: NW NARCH Program
Indian country has been particularly hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, with skyrocketing incidence and
mortality rates in many tribal communities. The scientific issues related to many aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and
its spread are now recognized by a large proportion of tribal people, young and old. We have a unique window
of opportunity to take advantage of this new awareness of public health as a catalyst to encourage young tribal
people to consider population health sciences for career choices. If the pandemic continues or new pathogens
circulate, the energy and commitment of well-trained tribal scientists who concentrate on issues that are most
pressing to tribal well-being will be highly welcomed and valued.
Our overall goal in the long-term is to develop a larger cadre of NW tribal people who will engage in
population health sciences and related research careers. For this particular grant, however, we will include the
following aims as we work to develop a pipeline of high school students who will become future researchers:
 1. Develop and implement a population health sciences research introductory program for tribal high
 school juniors and seniors that uses public health challenges and diseases of tribal health importance
 to introduce diverse topics in population health scientific research (such as virology, genetics, vaccine
 development, laboratory methods, epidemiology, environmental health, data science)
 2. Assist participating students with development of their own research projects with the help of local
 mentors, near-peer mentors, and with assistance from population health scientists at the Indian Health
 Board and its two partner universities (OHSU and Portland State University).
 3. Promote selection of population health science major fields of study in undergraduate programs
 following high school graduation in NW colleges and universities.
 4. Evaluate the program thoroughly from the viewpoints of process, impact, and outcomes.
We have had enormous success in supporting tribal researchers in graduate school programs, summer
research training institute programs, internships, cancer prevention fellowships, and in inclusion of college
undergraduates in various research roles at the NW Portland Area Indian Health Board. We will use the
population science lens to introduce the high school students to the many fields that make up population health
sciences, including laboratory sciences, infectious diseases, data science, immunology, epidemiology,
environmental health, and other related areas. Our program will be unique in Indian country, and the success
of our efforts will be furthered through our partnership with two premier research universities located nearby."
10902110,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Biospecimen Repository and Pathology Core is designed to provide support for the translational research
efforts of the Genomic Instability in Breast Cancer SPORE, serving the SPORE RP1, RP2 and RP3, and
developmental research projects. This Core will ensure a seamless integration of the current infrastructure
available at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), and constitute an essential component of this
SPORE project, facilitating and expediting the collection, annotation, storage, distribution, and digital archiving
and processing of biospecimens from breast cancer patients with specific patterns of DNA repair defects and/or
genetic instability included in the SPORE research projects. This Core was also conceived to provide SPORE
investigators with expert histopathologic evaluation of tumor samples from breast cancer patients enrolled in the
research protocols, patient-derived xenografts and murine models described in this SPORE application, in
conjunction with comparative pathologists from the MSKCC Laboratory of Comparative Pathology and the
Genetically Engineered Mouse Phenotyping Service. The Core will also provide assistance in performing and
interpreting immunohistochemical assays, in selecting tissue for microdissection and performing these
microdissections, and in the generation of dedicated tissue microarrays. The Core will provide multiplexed
immunophenotyping of the tumor and tumor microenvironment from breast cancers and breast cancer models.
The specific aims of the Biospecimen Repository and Pathology Core include 1) to maintain and expand the
systematic collection, annotation, and storage of bio-specimens for translational research of breast cancers with
specific patterns of DNA repair defects and/or genomic instability, 2) to perform expert pathologic evaluation of
all human breast cancer and animal models of breast cancer samples with specific patterns of DNA repair defects
and/or genomic instability and preparation of appropriate material for use by SPORE investigators, and 3) to
perform detailed immunophenotypic characterization of breast cancers and animal models of breast cancers
with specific patterns of DNA repair defects and/or genomic instability. By centralizing and standardizing the
pathology review of both human and murine breast cancer samples, from both clinical and research settings,
and by working in conjunction with other Cores within MSKCC on the processing and curation of the biospecimen
materials and digital images obtained from the samples included, the Biospecimen Repository and Pathology
Core will help mitigate the impact of common confounders in translational research studies, as well as it will
assist in the integration and prioritization of a variety of institutional pathology systems-related development
efforts."
10902111,"Abstract
Homologous recombination deficiency is prevalent in breast cancer up to a level of ~25%. Large-scale
alterations to the genome have been observed in these tumors, but if double-strand junctions are sequenced in
addition, it is possible to categorize these tumors into upstream and downstream defects in the DNA repair
pathway. We assert that there fundamentally different patterns of genome instability for double-strand break
repair. One is focused on the function of the BRCA1-BRCA2 pathway, where alterations in function are rather
frequent in breast cancers. Although traditionally perceived as equivalent, there is evidence to demonstrate
that downstream alterations that are BRCA1-like may have genomic and functional differences from those that
are BRCA2-like. Conversely, the upstream defects are focused on sensing DNA damage, which is another way
to suppress cancer formation. Our hypothesis is that different types of DNA repair defects result in the
utilization of distinct back-up DNA repair mechanisms, which themselves result in specific genomic signatures
and sensitivity to different therapeutic agents. Hence, we posit that upstream defects are best targeted by the
use of replication checkpoint inhibitors, but that BRCA defective tumors are best treated by targeting the
backup pathway, such as PARP-inhibitors or new agents beyond PARP-inhibitors. The goal of the first aim is
to apply the current genomic landscape tests of HR-deficiency and determine which method predicts most
accurately the type of homologous recombination DNA repair defect. The ultimate goal is to devise a
taxonomy based on the genomics features of homologous recombination DNA repair-deficiency, in addition to
target gene mutations, which will ultimately guide therapeutic options. The second aim is to generate
genetically engineered cell lines to understand the developmental drivers of the genomic landscape changes.
In addition, we will use these cells to test new synthetic lethal approaches to target specific subsets of breast
cancers with distinct types of homologous recombination DNA repair defects. The third aim consists of human
clinical trials either being conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center or elsewhere, where we are
conducting the trial or leading the analysis of the clinical bio-specimens for correlative study analyses. We will
study the impact of the PARP-inhibitor olaparib in patients who are BRCA1/2 wild-type but harbor a germline
and/or somatic genetic alteration affecting homologous recombination DNA repair-related genes. We will
extend our studies to also consider the combined effects of radiotherapy in combination with either ATR-
inhibitors or PARP-inhibitors. The ultimate goal of this project is to personalize the treatment of breast cancer
patients whose tumors display homologous recombination DNA repair-related defects according to their
genetic and genomic features, seeking to substantially improve the outcome of these poor prognosis patients
and direct the deployment of therapeutic agents either already approved (e.g. olaparib) or already in clinical
trials (e.g. ATR-inhibitors)."
10875636,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
The application of modern machine learning algorithms in radiology continues to grow, as these tools
represent potential huge improvements in efficiency, accessibility and accuracy of diagnostic and
screening tools. At the same time, these increasingly complex machine learning models can have biased
predictions against individuals of under-represented demographic groups, potentially perpetuating
pre-existing health disparities. Such fairness concerns are particularly important in public health
applications that focus on large scale population-based screening, as in cancer screening for breast and
lung cancer. In these settings, it is paramount to understand how often machine learning screening
algorithms can be unfair and biased, and how to mitigate these disparities. This proposal will develop
tools to quantify, correct, and analyze the biases of predictive algorithms in relation to different
demographic groups in real world settings. In particular, we will develop analysis and algorithms to
quantify the violation of fairness by a machine learning model in situations where information about the
sensitive attribute itself (such as biological sex, race or age) are not directly observable, and we will
provide algorithms that correct for their worst-case fairness violations. We will analyze our tools under
distribution shifts, whereby differences in populations exist, as is common in large scale cancer screening
programs. This project will also perform inference on the training samples and features most highly
associated with fairness violations, thereby providing guidance on the development of solutions to prevent
biased algorithms in the future. Our tools will be validated on a variety of large real-world radiology
datasets spanning multiple imaging modalities, including general chest X-ray datasets that include lung
cancer diagnoses (CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR), as well as the Emory Breast Cancer Imaging Dataset
(EMBED) and the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial, evaluating and correcting disparities for
predictive algorithms with respect to biological sex (where appropriate), race, and age. The results of this
project will establish critical knowledge about the propensity of machine learning models for medical
imaging diagnosis and cancer screening to be unfair and biased, as well as foundational tools to quantify
and mitigate these biases in these potentially game-changing technologies."
10899906,"ABSTRACT.
Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) results from autoimmune-mediated destruction of pancreatic β-cells. Currently, no long-
term treatments have been successful in preventing disease, and β-cell contribution to early pathology is
poorly understood. Early defects in β-cell secretory function, such as mis-trafficking of secretory proteins, are
evident prior to symptomatic onset. These defects are suggested to play a role in early disease progression,
possibly by neoantigen formation, yet underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Our recent work
demonstrates that proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and
interferon-γ (IFN-γ), substantially disrupt β-cell Golgi structure and function, which may explain early defects in
β-cell secretory function. The purpose of this proposal is to investigate how cytokine exposure drives
alterations to Golgi structure, and the implications this has on Golgi functions. To this point, we demonstrate
treatment with a chemical NO donor can recapitulate altered β-cell Golgi structure and function. Our
preliminary data further demonstrates knockdown (KD) of GRASP55, a key Golgi structural protein, can
substantially block Golgi fragmentation during cytokine stress, which may be regulated via post-translational
modification. Our central hypothesis is that proinflammatory cytokines drive NO-dependent, GRASP55-
mediated Golgi remodeling, leading to dysfunctional protein sorting and glycosylation. We will test this
hypothesis through two aims. Aim 1) will investigate the role of iNOS and NO in altered Golgi structure and
cell-surface glycosylation through genetic and pharmacological models of iNOS inhibition, as well as flow
cytometry to measure cell surface glycosylation. Aim 2) will investigate PTM regulation of GRASP55 in
modulation of Golgi structure and improper secretion of CtsD through GRASP55 KD models and expression of
PTM-mutants in a GRASP55 knockout (KO) cell line. Pharmacological inhibition of Golgi export will also be
used to investigate how GRASP55-dependent Golgi remodeling drives improper CtsD secretion. This
proposed work will advance understanding of how proinflammatory cytokines affect β-cell Golgi structure and
function, providing novel insight to β-cell contributions to disease pathology early in T1D and potential targets
for new therapeutics."
10900172,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Brain aging and disease occur alongside the loss of essential proteins and protein functions. For example,
thousands of inherited conditions are due to genetic haploinsufficiency, in which partial or complete loss of one
normal allele is sufficient to cause disease. Likewise, advanced age involves the loss of protective signaling,
such as through neurotrophic factors, that could prevent degenerative processes. In either case, strategies that
restore these single gene targets may be therapeutic. Current protein upregulation strategies, such as direct
protein delivery or viral gene therapies, are limited in the central nervous system as they lack regulatable dosing,
may distribute poorly, and can elicit neuroimmune reactions. The goal of this proposal is to investigate mRNA
regulation as an alternative approach to safely upregulate protein expression. Protein synthesis relies on mRNA
stability and translation efficiency, which are both determined by regulatory sequences in the untranslated
regions (UTRs) of mRNA. The 3’UTR encodes numerous regulatory elements that engage RNA-binding proteins
and regulatory RNAs to control mRNA translation and stability. I predict that blocking repressors from engaging
a 3’UTR could stimulate protein synthesis of a select gene of interest. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are
short, single-stranded DNA sequences that bind complementarily to RNA with high affinity and once bound, can
sterically block trans-acting elements from engaging the transcript. ASOs are a clinically proven technology that
have entered clinical trials for many neurodegenerative conditions, but there are currently no ASOs in clinical
trials that target 3’UTRs for gene-specific upregulation. Therefore, I hypothesize that ASOs that mask repressive
regulatory sequences on a 3’UTR can be used to stimulate synthesis of proteins that prevent or protect against
neurodegeneration or age-related diseases. I demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by increasing
expression of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a protein haploinsufficient in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) caused by dominant TBK1 mutations. In Aim 1, I will test if our existing
TBK1-upregulating ASOs can increase TBK1 expression and prevent neurodegenerative phenotypes in pre-
clinical models of TBK1 haploinsufficiency. In Aim 2, I will evaluate if particular 3’UTR cis-elements may be
universal targets for this ASO masking strategy. Aim 1 will establish the therapeutic relevance of 3’UTR-targeting
ASOs and support advancement of TBK1-upregulating ASOs to human clinical testing. Aim 2 will greatly extend
this approach to other gene targets, including neuroprotective protein factors. Completion of this proposal will
establish 3’UTR-targeted ASOs as a generalizable strategy to stimulate protein expression to treat
neurodegeneration and other age-related diseases. This training environment combines expertise in mRNA gene
repression mechanisms with experience in ASO development for neurodegeneration and, therefore, is perfectly
suited to support my endeavors to complete these aims and advance my development as a physician scientist."
10900249,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Inappropriate recognition of self nucleic acids (NA) by members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family can
result in autoimmune diseases such as lupus and psoriasis. TLR7 (and TLR8 in humans) and TLR9 can be
activated by self RNA and DNA, respectively, so defining the mechanisms that limit responses by these TLRs
is highly relevant to human health and disease. There is also accumulating evidence that the mechanisms
controlling TLR7 and TLR9 responses are distinct, but our understanding of the molecular bases for these
differences and their relevance for disease remain poor. This application is a renewal of the grant that has
funded our research studying the regulation of NA-sensing TLRs for 15 years. Our prior work helped to
establish the paradigm that multiple mechanisms operate to restrict the function of NA-sensing TLRs to
endosomes, which limits recognition of self NAs released from dead cells into the extracellular space. In the
last funding period, we made a major breakthrough that revealed a new mechanism mediated by the TLR
chaperone Unc93b1 that limits TLR7 responses to self RNA, and we showed that disruption of this mechanism
results in TLR7-dependent autoimmunity in mice. Intriguingly, this mechanism controls TLR7 but not TLR9.
 Our prior discoveries raise many key questions that we aim to tackle in this renewal application. We do not
yet understand the molecular steps controlling the new mechanism of TLR7 regulation we discovered.
Moreover, we recently identified autoimmune patients with in-born coding variants in Unc93b1, but we do not
know if/how these variants cause disease. In this proposal we will also expand our studies of NA-sensing TLR
regulation beyond Unc93b1 based on recently completed genome-wide CRISPR screens for genes that limit
TLR7 and TLR9 responses. Both screens identified genes and pathways involved in core cell biological
processes, including endosome and lysosome regulation, underscoring the paradigm that the cell biology of
NA-sensing TLRs is critical to their regulation. However, the hits from the TLR7 and TLR9 screens are almost
completely non-overlapping, providing exciting mechanistic insights into how these receptors are distinctly
regulated. Based on these results, we propose 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1 will define the key steps by which
Unc93b1 limits TLR7/8 responses and will test whether the human coding variants we have identified disrupt
these steps. Aim 2 will characterize results from a genome-wide CRISPR screen that identified the cellular
machinery and pathways limiting TLR7 responses to self RNA. Aim 3 will focus on TLR9 and begin to define
the mechanisms that limit TLR9 responses to self DNA.
 The overall impact of this application comes from the central role that NA-sensing TLRs play in
autoimmunity and from the benefit gained by defining the mechanisms that limit responses to self NA. Our
central premise is that defining the mechanisms that regulate TLR7 and TLR9 will uncover their distinct roles in
autoimmune diseases and enable more effective therapies."
10904721,"PROJECT SUMMARY PRECLINICAL/CO-CLINICAL CORE
The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) and The Jackson Laboratory Center for Precision Genetics (JCPG) occupy a
unique niche within the global biomedical research community. Although we do not see patients, many of
these individuals have benefited from our stewardship of the thousands of different mouse strains that JAX
provides for use in human disease research. And it is not just our mice; our faculty researchers, with deep
expertise in genetics and mammalian biology, collaborate directly with investigators at hospitals, medical
centers and an array of other clinically oriented partners worldwide. Thus, the JCPG will operate using a “hub
and spokes” concept where the JCPG forms part of a mammalian disease model “hub” that integrates a variety
of JAX resources to establish an array of collaborative “spokes” with a variety of partners to co-produce precise
preclinical disease models. The Preclinical/Co-clinical core of the JCPG will work with expert clinical, patient,
research and industry collaborators to facilitate optimal creation and application of existing and nominated
projects. Together with the JCPG Coordination Core, the Preclinical/Co-clinical Core and the Steering
Committee will apply a series of benchmark standards to work toward the eventual goal of translation into
clinical practice. Ultimately, we will further extend our impact by providing a more advanced Fee for Service
approach to broaden community access to JAX resources. To meet current goals of the JCPG and to refine
and expand its future operation, the Preclinical/Co-clinical Core will: 1) Solicit, evaluate and prioritize new
preclinical/co-clinical project requests and provide recommendations to the Steering Committee for adoption by
the JCPG. 2) Advance new models through the production-like pipelines, with characterization and drug
testing so they can more tangibly inform future clinical applications. 3) Continue to develop and expand
existing JAX infrastructure to facilitate access to clinical data and samples, supporting data exchange between
mouse information and patient data."
10904724,"PROJECT SUMMARY BIOINFORMATICS CORE
The broad goal of the Bioinformatics Core is to support development of novel mouse models in The Jackson
Laboratory (JAX) Center for Precision Genetics (JCPG) with portal that supports the activities of the Center
with simplified access to tools, resources and expertise, and deploys data driven strategies that integrate
genetic, genomic and phenotypic information across humans and mice. The development of disease models
has been hampered by simplifying assumptions regarding disease variant identification, phenotype annotation
and model development. Unfortunately, the early notion held by human and mouse geneticists that a defect in
a single gene would equate to a single disease has proven wrong and it is now clear that human disease is
much more complex. Progress depends on making animal models that reflect this complexity.
The JCPG Bioinformatics Core will develop, implement, disseminate, apply and validate data-driven
approaches to the refinement of mouse models through the computational integration of genetic and
phenotypic heterogeneity. This work harnesses and integrates a suite of tools and data resources available at
The Jackson Laboratory and beyond, including GeneWeaver, Mouse Phenome Database, Human Phenotype
Ontology and Monarch Initiative, and multiple resources from the Mouse Genome Database and Alliance for
Genome Resources. The practical goal of the Core is to establish the workflows, implement software
enhancements and a publicly accessible portal that provide a seamless user experience for the identification,
design and evaluation of mouse models appropriate for a given disease. To achieve this our work will pursue
the following three Aims, each designed to develop specific tools or services:
Aim 1. We will develop a suite of services for the analytic integration of human and mouse genetic, genomic
and phenomic data to identify and prioritize features for enhanced precision disease models.
Aim 2. We will provide an integrated study intake and management system with data quality control, analytics
and dissemination tools that interoperates with our knowledge graph and catalogue.
Aim 3. We will develop an external end-user facing portal for access to guided workflows, data and model and
model organisms, project tracking and access to integrated resources."
10904725,"PROJECT SUMMARY RESOURCE AND SERVICE CORE
The overall goal of the Resource & Service Core is to publicize the mice and services developed through the
JCPG to the broader scientific community. To accomplish this goal, the Core will work closely with the
Bioinformatics Core in the development of the JCPG website and portal to allow public access to resources
and tools. The distribution of mice will leverage the existing mouse production infrastructure at The Jackson
Laboratory (JAX) as well as the existing NIH-funded Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center (MMRRC)
for a seamless transition of models from the core to the community. The Core will add new services and refine
existing service to ultimately develop into a fee for service program that operates in professional service
environment, with customer quotes, project execution, deliverables, finalized reports and feedback.
JAX has an almost 90-year history of developing, archiving, and distributing laboratory mice, and their
derivative resources and information, to the scientific community. The JCPG will complement and expand
resource stewardship at JAX by leveraging the deep expertise of JAX researchers and services.
JAX is seeing a predictable demand for model generation services as a result of CRISPR/Cas9 genome
editing technologies and the reduction in costs for patient sequencing. This, in turn, has increased the demand
for phenotyping and ancillary services, such as histology, gene expression, microscopy, etc. that can be
tailored for each disease model. Another growing demand that the JCPG will help to satisfy is the need for
pharmacology and efficacy-based preclinical testing in mice.
Operation of the JCPG Resource and Service Core will serve to: 1) Provide new mouse models to the scientific
community, following well-established processes for, rigor, quality assurance and customer service. Mice
generated by the Disease Modeling Unit (DMU) will pass seamlessly through our customer service and
production infrastructure to the JAX-MMRRC repository for maintenance, distribution and preservation. Each
step of the process will be facilitated by tools and processes developed by the Bioinformatics section of the
JCPG. 2) Refine existing and consider new key JAX services with input from our clients and make them
available to the biomedical community on a fee-based mechanism with a focus on maximizing awareness and
external availability using existing JAX outreach and marketing infrastructure and efforts. 3) Develop an
integrated management and operational structure that weaves together core services and delivers them as
efficiently as possible. Successful implementation of the Resource/Services core depends on our experienced
management team to integrate individual service cores into a seamless program."
10904728,"PROJECT SUMMARY DISEASE MODELING UNIT
The advent of high-throughput sequencing has allowed rapid discovery of the genetic causes of disease.
However, our ability to translate these discoveries into therapeutics has not kept pace due, at least in part, to a
lack of precise, predictive animal models which still serve as a critical step toward translating potential new
treatments for use in the clinic. The mouse remains a near indispensable tool on the road to clinical
application. Genetically accurate mouse models can be designed to recapitulate most human disease
pathology and therefore allow for detailed studies and preclinical testing of novel therapeutics.
JAX has a long history of developing and studying mouse models of human disease and the institutional
commitment, scale, and expertise to build The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) Center for Precision Genetics
(JCPG). Indeed, JAX is currently funded as one of three Pilot Centers for Precision Genetics, (U54
OD020351). The next iteration of the JCPG will build on the groundwork laid by this effort that was able to
successfully move, within one grant cycle, from disease model development through completion of the
preclinical work to now move toward clinical trials. The JCPG infrastructure now proposed refines, focuses and
expands on the infrastructure and services that were essential to the successes of the previous pilot. The next
JCPG will serve our existing diverse set of clinical collaborators even better and broaden access for an even
larger portion of the biomedical community. The JCPG Disease Modeling Unit (DMU) is key to launching
development of a new disease model. Working closely first with the Bioinformatics Core to establish an
optimal genetic/genomic design the DMU will then guide each model through phenotypic characterization
working in consultation with preclinical and clinical partners (JCPG Pre/CoClinical Core) to validate and
establish the model before passing the new model to the Resource and Services Core for colony maintenance,
preservation and worldwide distribution.
The overall goal of the Disease Modeling Unit (DMU) is to refine the operation of the JCPG Cores into a single
integrated, flexible, and cohesive disease modeling pipeline that can support the growing and diverse needs of
the biomedical community. Many key components are already in place so the DMU will focus on building the
program and project management infrastructure to integrate innovative new tools and analysis platforms.
To accomplish this the DMU will: 1) build a comprehensive precision model development and characterization
pipeline that has the scale, management infrastructure, and bioinformatics tools to support external
nominations from the community, 2) leverage ongoing JCPG projects to “seed” the pipeline with “shovel-ready”
high-impact projects that will allow refinement of pipeline structure and processes and, 3) develop and execute
three Demonstration Projects to extend JCPG technical and scientific capabilities to support a wider array of
disease modeling needs."
10904757,"Protection against numerous infectious diseases correlates with the quantity and quality of pathogen-specific 
antibody (Ab) molecules secreted by B cells. Seasonal flu vaccines contain hemagglutinin (HA) proteins 
designed to elicit anti-HA Abs capable of conferring protective immunity against influenza infection, but the 
current annual flu vaccines confer protection only in ~60% of the population. Recent studies have focused on 
designing new HA-based immunogens that can elicit broadly-protective Abs (bpAbs) capable of protecting 
against diverse influenza strains, but bpAbs elicited by these strategies are often short-lived. A gap in our 
knowledge regarding the molecular features, functionalities, and longevity of influenza Abs, specifically related 
to the impact of pre-existing humoral memory from prior exposure, impedes the design of vaccines capable of 
generating long-lasting bpAbs. Due to the ubiquitous nature of influenza and recommended seasonal 
vaccinations, most of the population is exposed to influenza at a young age, and many studies have made 
observations that suggest Ab repertoire generated from the childhood exposure is ‘imprinted’ in the immune 
system and persists in circulation through ensuing exposures to drifted strains. Despite these observations, 
information on the clinical relevance and impact of imprinted serum Ab repertoire on subsequent vaccine 
responses is lacking. Here, we propose to apply cutting edge transcriptomic and proteomic tools to matched 
pre- and post-vaccination samples to distinguish the imprinted influenza Ab repertoire from newly elicited (de 
novo) Abs to define the biophysical and functional features of imprinted Abs. Identifying various avenues for 
overcoming potential restrictions imposed by the imprinted Ab repertoire could be key for the design of a 
universal flu vaccine that can confer long-lasting protection against diverse influenza strains."

We propose to systematically evaluate mechanisms of cooperative interaction and to optimize the potency of a
treatment regimen that combines a targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) with immune checkpoint inhibition
(ICI; e.g. anti-PD-1) to enhance the anti-tumor immune response against metastatic or recurrent head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Moderate dose (8-12 Gy) external beam radiation therapy
(EBRT) is capable of eliciting an in situ vaccine effect, converting the targeted tumor into a nidus for enhanced
tumor antigen recognition. In preclinical and clinical studies, this results in diversification of the T cell receptor
(TCR) repertoire. Consequently, in preclinical studies, EBRT improves the response to ICIs. However, clinical
studies in HNSCC patients have not demonstrated a benefit from combining EBRT with ICIs. More is needed if
we aim to develop an effective approach to achieving consistent durable tumor control in patients with metastatic
or recurrent HNSCC. In pursuit of this goal, we propose to evaluate a new strategy to leverage the capacity of
radiation to enhance response to ICIs by using TRTs to deliver radiation to all tumor sites in settings of metastatic
disease. Our team has developed and led preclinical and clinical testing of a novel class of TRT using
alkylphosphocholine (APCh) analogs that are IV injected and deliver radiation to cancers in vivo. These show
tumor-selective uptake in most mammalian tumor cells and tumor locations, including primary and metastatic
sites of HNSCC. In our current SPORE grant we have confirmed the selective uptake and safety of delivering a
first generation APCh analog that binds halogen radionuclides (131I-NM404) in patients with HNSCC. We have
now developed a next generation APCh analog (NM600) that, compared to NM404, has more favorable
dosimetry due to reduced albumin binding and has the ability to chelate diverse radionuclides. Here we propose
to use NM600 to compare the capacity of distinct radionuclides to immuno-modulate HNSCC tumors in a manner
that augments response to ICIs and increases the diversity or clonality of the TCR repertoire among tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes. We hypothesize that NM600 will enhance the rate and depth of response to ICIs and
that this will correlate with effects on the TCR repertoire that are dependent on the ability of NM600 to modulate
tumor cell immune susceptibility by activating a type I IFN response. We expect that NM600 will also elicit
immunogenic cell death, local inflammation, and temporary depletion of suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs)
from the tumor microenvironment. By comparing the relative capacity of distinct radionuclides to elicit these, we
will develop a fundamental understanding of the interactions of TRTs and anti-tumor immunity. In a phase I
clinical study, we will then test whether NM600 can be delivered safely in combination with anti-PD-1 and
enhance response to this immunotherapy. The insights and treatment regimens developed in these studies
should enable translation to advanced phase clinical testing in patients with HNSCC and may guide the
development of similar combinations of TRTs and ICIs for other types of metastatic cancer."

Our current inability to accurately predict treatment outcomes for head and neck cancer (HNC) patients
represents a major challenge for clinicians and undoubtedly contributes to both the poor overall and progression
free survival rates in advanced disease. Currently no predictive biomarkers are used clinically for definitive
therapies, thus, there is a compelling need to develop new biomarkers and tools to improve clinical decision
making. Functional biomarkers that can provide multiple orthogonal endpoints are well suited to reporting on a
complex and dynamic environment such as the tumor microenvironment (TME). For this reason, we intend to
investigate HNC biomarkers both directly in tumor samples and in a bioengineered patient-specific model to
create a novel suite of endpoints. We will use state of the art single cell RNA sequencing (scCITE-seq), protein
expression signatures from tumor tissue microarrays (TMA’s) and analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTC’s). We
will utilize this multi-omic, patient-specific data set to identify and validate signatures of treatment efficacy and
stratify patient outcomes. We will then test the feasibility of using patient specific bioengineered models to inform
patient care in a clinical pilot study. The bioengineered model of the HNC TME is made entirely of cells derived
from the same patient tumor sample, from the same patient cohort used for CITEseq, TMA and CTC analysis.
These microscale patient-specific (built from the individual patients own cells) bioengineered models recapitulate
the TME architecture, containing a HNC epithelial spheroid surrounded by a matrix containing fibroblasts and
immune cells and flanked by blood and lymphatic microvessels. Our specific aims are: 1) Evaluate the ability of
HNC patient-specific bioengineered models to predict treatment efficacy, where we will build patient-specific
bioengineered models for 22 HNC patients (representing HPV-positive and HPV-negative disease and patients
treated with primary surgery with (chemo)radiation or primary chemoradiation) and treat them with the same
treatment the patient receives. Metrics of treatment success in the models will be correlated with actual patient
outcomes including progression free survival. 2) Identify HNC biomarkers using scCITE-seq and TMA, where
we will perform scCITE-seq and will correlate gene expression and cell populations with patient outcomes to
investigate existing putative biomarkers and identify additional novel biomarkers. Biomarkers will be further
investigated in a TMA and in CTC’s. 3) Use of bioengineered models to inform dose de-escalation in a clinical
pilot study, where tissue will be acquired from surgery from 24 HPV+ HNC patients and used for patient-specific
bioengineered model creation. Models will be treated to determine the radiosensitivity of a patient’s tumor and
to stratify intermediate risk patients between 50 or 60 Gy treatment groups. Primary endpoints will focus on
feasibility of model integration with secondary endpoints including local control. The successful completion of
these aims will provide powerful new tools for the stratification of HNC patients and improved clinical decision
making to help inform the most effective treatment selections for individual HNC patients in the future."
10904789,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 3
 The primary objective of this proposal is to examine the cooperation of the receptor tyrosine kinases
Axl and MerTK as drivers of an immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and if targeting
tumor Axl and MerTK simultaneously can turn this suppressive TIME (cold) to an inflammatory TIME (hot).
 Immune checkpoint inhibitors have gained FDA approval in the management of Head and Neck Cancer
(HNC). Despite established benefit, clinical trials have highlighted that less than 20% of HNC patients respond
to this promising new class of inhibitors. This suggests a gap in knowledge and represents a major clinical
hurdle as we try to understand how best to enhance the immune system to better outcomes. Recent work from
our laboratory has shown that Axl and MerTK cooperate to drive an immunologically cold environment. In
addition, targeting tumor Axl or MerTK individually versus a new class of drug that targets both Axl and MerTK
simultaneously, called INCB081776, revealed that dual targeting of Axl and MerTK was superior to targeting Axl
or MerTK alone in immune models. Furthermore, INCB081776 potently inhibited tumor growth in
immunocompetent mice but not in immunodeficient mice, demonstrating that a functional immune system is
important. Treatment of syngeneic models with INCB081776 was associated with dose-related increases in the
percentage of tumor-infiltrating effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as macrophages with the M1 phenotype.
In addition, INCB081776 decreased the percentage of intratumoral M2 macrophages and monocytic myeloid–
derived suppressor cell (M-MDSC) immune cell populations. Together, this suggests that simultaneous targeting
of Axl and MerTK is superior in producing an anti-tumor (hot) TIME. Collectively, our data suggests that tumor
Axl and MerTK work together to drive HNC via tumor intrinsic and tumor extrinsic (immune) mechanisms. We
hypothesize that tumor Axl and MerTK cooperate to produce a myeloid-suppressive TIME, through regulation
of immune mediators, and that therapeutic strategies targeting tumor Axl and MerTK simultaneously will shift the
immune TIME from cold to hot resulting in greater tumor kill. In Aim 1 we intend to define how tumor Axl and
MerTK cooperate to regulate immune mediators that promote this cold TIME by recruiting myeloid derived
precursor cells and driving M2 polarization ultimately leading to T cell suppression. In Aim 2 we intend to
determine the impact of targeting tumor Axl and MerTK simultaneously in HNC syngeneic mouse models and
measure the impact on immune cell infiltration (Macrophages and T cells) and tumor growth. Finally, in Aim 3,
we propose a clinical trial to utilize this promising new drug, INCB081776, in patients and determine if it can shift
a cold TIME to a hot TIME and if this impacts tumor growth in humans. To carry out these studies we have
assembled a strong team of molecular biologists, translational physician-scientists, medical oncologist, radiation
oncologist, pathologists and biostatisticians. This investigative strategy holds great promise for translation to the
clinic and brings innovation by leveraging new molecular insights to a significant existing problem in HNC."

Immunocompromised HIV-positive patients have serious complications with opportunistic
oncogenic viral infections that can lead B-cell lymphomas. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and
Kaposi’s sarcoma associated virus (KSHV) are two human oncogenic gammaherpesviruses
associated with B-cell lymphomas either individually or as co-infections. EBV-associated B-cell
lymphomas are established as latency III infection with the major latent genes expressed as well
as the small non-coding RNAs. EBV transformed B cells drive latency III, also seen in HIV
associated EBV-positive lymphomas. EBV is also associated with other lymphomas including
Burkitt’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and post-transplant and AIDS
associated lymphomas in immunocompromised HIV-patients. EBV also efficiently transforms
human primary B-cells in vitro, into immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). These
nascent transformed B cells express latent genes, one of which is the Epstein-Barr nuclear
antigen EBNA3C, essential for immortalization of B-cells. EBNA3C regulates cellular and viral
gene expression through interaction with transcription repressors, and complexes of the
mammalian cell cycle which include CyclinA, and components of the SCF proteosome
degradation pathway. Our long term goal is to determine the role of EBNA3C in reprogramming
viral and infected cell genomes through interactions with the tumor suppressor Rb and the
regulatory consequences of these interactions as related to cell survival, cell cycle regulation
and proliferation. We will investigate the mechanism of Rb regulation through specific post-
translation modifications after infection by EBV, which includes phosphorylation and acetylation
important for targeted ubiquitination. We will determine if enhanced phosphorylation/acetylation
of Rb occurs through recruitment of CyclinD/Cdk4/6 complexes by EBNA3C important for cell
cycle progression. This results in loss of Rb through ubiquitination which leads to cell and viral
genome reprogramming by activation of the cellular E2F pathway, cell cycle progression,
increased survival and malignant transformation. These studies will examine the role of
EBNA3C in regulating the Rb/CyclinD/E2F network important for B-cell immortalization with
implications for novel insights into KSHV and EBV contributions to latency III lymphomas in HIV
patients."

would postpone the deterioration in cognition and mental health that occurs with age. The proposed research
will identify, optimize, and then test in laboratory animals such therapeutics as steps towards future clinical
use. The research focus is on mitochondria, the organelle in brain neurons that provides energy and many
other functions for neurons to function and remain healthy. Mitochondria become impaired with age;
mitochondrial impairment is one of the well-known hallmarks of aging. In pilot studies, we have identified a few
new drugs that have the potential to enhance mitochondrial function across age. We will search for and identify
five times more to enlarge the set of potential “mitotherapeutics.” These drugs will then be tested in laboratory
animals to determine whether they can protect mitochondria from the insults associated with age and enhance
brain function; postponing or eliminating the cognitive and mental health issues that occur with age. Drugs with
the potential to postpone or eliminate these issues would have an enormous impact on brain health for the late
adult and elderly in the U.S. population."
10901438,"Ophthalmoscopy, or the in vivo imaging of the retina, is an essential tool for the characterization and diagnosis
of retinal and systemic diseases. Despite the ubiquity of conventional ophthalmic devices, oftentimes the
visualization of smaller features is limited in current modalities due to the presence of optical aberrations. While
adaptive optics (AO) can mitigate the effect of these aberrations and provide nearly diffraction limited images of
the eye using an AO scanning light ophthalmoscope (AOSLO), it cannot mitigate common ophthalmic conditions,
such as cataracts, or high myopia, which cause substantial wavefront aberrations and result in reduced visual
performance and image resolution. Moreover, the aperture of the human eye limits image resolution, impeding
visualization of the smallest structures in the retina. Current implementations of AOSLO split-detection (or phase
contrast) is also limited, as they cannot resolve features within the eye that lie at arbitrary angles, preventing full
characterization of phase-resolved structures. Finally, few modifications in AOSLO design since its conception
in 2002 are able to be applied to extant systems and require extensive mechanical modifications, precluding
upgrades in many devices. Altogether, these gaps prevent widespread accessibility of AO imaging to the
general population. As such, the objective of this proposal is to develop and construct optical elements and
models whereby an AOSLO might be equipped to image broader populations with increased resolution, thereby
accelerating future clinical applications and increasing current knowledge. The first aim will be to implement a
Dove prism for arbitrary-angle split-detection imaging in vivo. This integration would allow for visualization of
features oriented at various, arbitrary angles throughout the eye, such as vasculature, whose feature
visualization is severely limited in current AOSLO imaging modalities. This modification would enable features
of various retinal pathologies to be captured at multiple angles while simultaneously enabling extant systems to
be altered with minimal complexity. The second aim will be to explore and integrate variable in vivo illumination
profiles for both improving the resolution and extending the depth of focus of an AOSLO. This integration would
encompass such optical elements as Fresnel Zone Plates, light axicons, and annular masks to transform the
light intensity and distribution being delivered for the eye, allowing for superior resolution. This newly configured
illumination profile would enable ophthalmic imaging to expand beyond current subject groups while
simultaneously providing superior images with enhanced contrast. The research planned within this proposal will
address a fundamental gap in the AO and ophthalmological communities while providing a distinctive training
opportunity. This training plan will include in vivo retinal imaging, optical and mathematical design, software
development, engineering fundamentals, and system integration. This will provide me with an ideal platform to
develop my professional and scientific proficiency while building the foundation of skills necessary for my
development into a successful, independent scientist."

Significance: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common infection during pregnancy. While these
infections are typically minor, they are associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight,
pyelonephritis and sepsis. Despite this, there is insufficient evidence comparing the different antimicrobial
treatment regimes. This lack of comparative effectiveness data is particularly concerning given the increasing
prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in urinary pathogens. As a result, medical organizations have been
unable to provide up to date guidance to patients and providers on best practices for treatment.
Specific Aims: The proposed project will not only directly clarify the treatment options; it will also develop tools
for future researchers to investigate similar questions. The first aim is to compare the safety and effectiveness
of the most common antimicrobials used to treat UTIs during pregnancy, as well as to assess whether
antimicrobial choice should be influenced by the patient’s symptomaticity. The second aim of this study is to
develop and validate algorithms for the identification of UTIs during pregnancy. Successful development of
these algorithms will allow researchers to identify UTIs in large health care data sources.
Approach: In Aim 1, we will conduct a cohort study comparing the safety and effectiveness of the five most
commonly prescribed antimicrobials for UTIs in US pregnancies. The data source for this study will be the
University of North Carolina (UNC) Health System electronic health records (EHR). Approximately 14,000
people who received one of the five most common antimicrobial treatments will be compared on several
maternal and perinatal outcomes including: preterm birth, low birthweight, pyelonephritis, spontaneous
abortion, stillbirth, maternal sepsis, prescriptions for additional courses of antimicrobials, and antimicrobial
switching. We will then examine heterogeneity in antimicrobial effectiveness and safety between people who
are symptomatic versus asymptomatic. For Aim 2, we developed two algorithms containing diagnosis and
procedure codes that we hypothesize will accurately identify symptomatic and asymptomatic UTIs. We will
then manually review patient charts and assess how well the algorithm correctly classifies patients.
Fellowship Information: The applicant is a PhD student in Epidemiology at UNC Chapel Hill and a
predoctoral fellow at the UNC Center for Pharmacoepidemiology. Mr. Kahrs proposes a training plan that will
equip him with the tools to launch a successful career in comparative effectiveness research for pregnant
people. This training plan will take place in a thriving collaborative research environment, guided by an
established team of interdisciplinary mentors. The outputs from this fellowship will not only help guide clinical
care for pregnant people but will assist Mr. Kahrs in his journey towards becoming an independent investigator."
10874698,"Project Summary/Abstract
The proposal seeks to establish a pathophysiologic link between premature atrial contractions (PACs) and atrial
fibrillation (AF). It has been well established that patients with frequent PACs are more likely to develop incident
AF. But whether PACs are causative, or an epiphenomenon, is unclear. We hypothesize that PACs from the
pulmonary veins or lateral left atrium (LA) lead to more atrial dyssynchrony compared to PACs from other regions,
and that this dyssynchrony leads to atrial structural remodeling (via increased wall stress) and fibrosis that serves
to facilitate AF maintenance. Our preliminary data in a swine model of chronic PACs demonstrates that chronic
PACs lead to atrial electrophysiologic (slow conduction) and structural (fibrosis) remodeling, which is more
pronounced for dyssynchronous PACs from the lateral left atrium compared to synchronous PACs from the septum
or controls without PACs. In our first Aim, we will explore in the swine model how differences in PAC coupling-
interval and atrial rate affect the degree of atrial remodeling and whether PAC cessation leads to complete
regression of remodeling. We will test whether an antifibrotic drug, pirfenidone, prevents adverse atrial structural
and electrical remodeling in the presence of PACs. We will also assess which molecular changes precede the
development of cardiomyopathy to determine the critical molecular pathways leading to PAC mediated atrial
remodeling. In our second Aim, we will establish the importance of these findings in humans by performing a
longitudinal case-control study of patients with a high burden of atrial ectopy to identify if chronic PAC-induced
atrial dyssynchrony leads to echocardiographic atrial remodeling. We will determine whether patients with frequent
PACs have more echocardiographic left atrial remodeling and AF over time compared to those without PACs. We
will also determine whether specifically dyssynchronous PACs are more likely to lead to atrial remodeling and AF
than synchronous PACs. The significance of the proposed work is that if frequent PACs are found to lead to
remodeling that leads to the development of incident AF, early intervention in patients with frequent PACs, with
medical therapy or catheter ablation, may prevent the later development of atrial remodeling and AF. Successful
prevention of AF could mean that millions of individuals could avoid debilitating loss of quality of life and enormous
healthcare costs."

Organ systems are composed of a wealth of cellular subpopulations whose spatial organization
within a given tissue are deeply intertwined with their functions and homeostasis controls.
Similarly, within the space of a single-cell, the biochemical environment is also heterogeneous
where the dynamic interactions of molecules determine the fitness, behavior and fate of the cell.
Our understanding of the cell interactions and the biomolecule interactions has recently been
transformed by the revolutionary single-cell genomics and single-molecule imaging technologies.
However, the development and application of these technologies have been exclusively centered
on the context of mononuclear cellularity. Hiding in the blind spot are multinucleated cell-types,
including myofibers, cardiomyocytes, syncytiotrophoblasts, certain cancer cells, all of which
cause devasting human disease when go awry. The syncytial nature of the multinucleated cells,
which possess the polyploidy and often the vast cytosolic volumes, raises fascinating questions
with respect to the spatial organizations of the cell-cell interactions and biomolecule distributions.
The fundamental yet largely unknown questions include: 1) How heterogeneous is the tissue
microenvironment that surrounds the syncytial cells? 2) Do nuclei from the shared cell body
coordinate gene expression in response to the external stimuli and cell-cell communications? 3)
What is the mechanism that governs the transports and localizations of mRNAs in the
multinucleated cells? Our research program exploits the unique features of specialized cell-types
as a means to understand mechanistic underpinnings of various developmental systems. This
proposal leverages myofiber as the uniquely-suited model to investigate the above questions in
a spatially defined manner. First, we will develop and deploy new methodologies to probe the
spatial transcriptomics for the multiple types of syncytial tissues. Second, we will devise the
reverse engineering strategy to assemble the single-syncytium of human muscle with genetic
trackabilities and later graft them to live animals for the in vivo study of the cell-cell communication
and intra-syncytium mRNA distributions. Third, we will conduct the in-depth gene function and
mechanism studies to unveil new paradigms of intercellular communication and the intracellular
mRNA trafficking. Broadly, this research program relies on our diverse expertise in genomics, cell
engineering and computation such that we can create a virtuous cycle of innovation and discovery
over the course of the MIRA award. We anticipate that the knowledge and techniques will benefit
the greater biological community, including genetics, cell biologists and developmental biologists."
10874702,"Project Summary / Abstract
A central problem in biology is to understand how genomic variation affects genome function to influence
phenotypes. Key challenges and opportunities lie in linking genomic variants to phenotypes, human health, and
disease. Because it is not feasible to experimentally probe all genomic variants of interest in all contexts,
improved computational methods to accurately predict the impact of unknown genomic variants are necessary.
The aim of this research proposal is to gain mechanistic understanding of functional genomic interactions and
ultimately to develop computational approaches to model and predict relationships among variation, functional
elements, genome function, and phenotype. Two recently acquired key assets will be used to infer distal
functional interactions among DNA elements: i) 3D genomics data and ii) multiple genome alignments. High-
resolution contact mapping experiments (Hi-C and similar methods) have shown that the structural ensembles
of chromosomes are fluid and yet specific to cell type and phase of life1. These ensembles of partially organized
structures bring sections of DNA separated by great genomic distance into close spatial proximity and play an
important role in controlling gene transcription 2,3. By measuring the frequency of physical contacts among DNA
elements, DNA-DNA proximity ligation assays offer insight into the existence of functional interactions among
the same elements, even when the nature of the interaction is unknown. In the last few years, there has been
an explosion of activity directed toward assembling the genomes of many species 35–37. Hundreds of newly
assembled end-to-end genomes constitute a dataset of transformative importance in studying the general
operating principles of genomes across the tree of life using evolutionary information. This proposal aims to
combine data from proximity ligation assays and coevolutionary information extracted from multiple genome
alignments to infer the network of functional interactions among DNA elements. The computational approach will
be based on Direct Coupling Analysis 29–32 (DCA) and other machine learning methods. The PI has previously
employed DCA to study genome architecture 33 as well as in other contexts 34, and has already made important
contributions to the field of 3D genomics."

Mitochondrial dysfunction is pivotal to the neuropathological sequelae following traumatic spinal cord
injury (SCI). During this initial time window, there is a significant loss of mitochondria with an
inflammatory/oxidative environment that perpetuates the pathophysiology. It is hypothesized that to
rescue the cellular damage occurring following SCI, one must replace damaged mitochondria, while also
changing the damaging microenvironment. We have documented that maintaining endogenous
mitochondrial bioenergetics with acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC), an alternative mitochondrial biofuel, or reducing
oxidative stress by replenishing endogenous antioxidant, glutathione (GSH) with N-acetylcysteine amide
(NACA) after SCI results in increased, but limited long-term functional neuroprotection. We have also
reported that acute mitochondrial transplantation (MitoTxp) using intraspinal injections of mitochondria
isolated from rat soleus muscle significantly preserved bioenergetic function 48hr post-SCI. However,
this was sporadically successful due to the challenges of both accumulating mitochondria at the site of
injury and maintaining their viability prior to cellular uptake. In the current proposal, we will develop a
thermo-gelling, erodible hydrogel system for the localized delivery of viable mitochondria to test the
neuroprotective efficacy of combined MitoTxp and pharmaceutical interventions (ALC and/or NACA) after
contusion SCI. The use of an injectable hydrogel will permit the development of a local environment which
can aide in maintaining mitochondrial health through optimization of the hydrogel niche. We will determine
1) optimum constituents for isolated mitochondria to remain viable for extended periods in polymeric
hydrogels, 2) whether exogenous mitochondria transplanted via less invasive intrathecal route equally
preserve integrity of bioenergetics compared to intraspinal route and 3) consequences of acute or
delayed MitoTxp in combination with ALC and/or NACA on bioenergetics, oxidative stress, and functional
neuroprotection after SCI."

 Overactive bladder (OAB) severely impacts over 12% of the adult population in the United States
– roughly 30 million people (Irwin, et al., 2006). Pressing and frequent urges to urinate, arousal
from sleep, and sometimes incontinence, result in immense psychosocial and financial costs,
leading to an estimated annual economic burden of >$70B in the US alone (Reynolds, et al.,
2016). Current OAB interventions are varied and include pharmaceuticals, neurostimulators,
botulinum toxin injections, and surgical approaches, all of which have adverse side effects and
lack widespread and enduring efficacy. In addition, drug therapies require long-term dosing and
other treatments can require repeat clinical interventions.
 Stellartech Research Corporation is developing the NewUro Uzap device for transurethral
radiofrequency mucosal partitioning. It is the only minimally-invasive, single-session, non-drug,
non-implant therapy for alleviating the symptoms of OAB without compromising voiding function.
Research has shown excessive electrical connectivity within the bladder mucosa in models of
overactivity (Kanai et al., 2007). This results in exaggerated propagation of wave-like intrinsic
electrical and mechanical activity, which is anticipated to be amenable to therapy by minimally
invasive thermal ablation of mucosal isolation lines by the Uzap. The innovations behind the Uzap
system are already covered by 7 granted patents. Preliminary studies of Uzap ablation on whole
pig bladder and tissue specimens demonstrated reduced contractile response to agonists.
Successful preclinical safety and performance tests were completed in ex vivo and preliminary in
vivo porcine models. This Fast-Track proposal seeks, in Phase 1, to demonstrate long-term in
vivo safety and durability of Uzap therapy, and, in Phase 2, to 1) perform a long-term animal
safety and efficacy study; 2) optimize system and electrode design and usability and fabricate
Verification and Validation units; 3) perform Verification and Validation tests; hold a pre-IDE
(Investigational Device Exemption) meeting and submit an IDE application for a future First-In-
Human trial of 30 female patients with refractory overactive bladder with incontinence. The
rigorous work proposed will create a firm base for advancing the Uzap to the clinical phase and
towards commercialization, in order to provide relief for millions of patients and eliminate the need
for implants or repetitive clinical interventions."
10874602,"Project Abstract/Summary
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among older adults in the developed
world. While recent studies support that mitochondrial (mt) defects in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD, the causes of the dysfunction remains to be elucidated. Of the genetic
polymorphisms linked to AMD, one of the most prevalent occurs in the gene encoding complement factor H
(CFH). CFH is a negative regulator of the alternative complement pathway and protects against inappropriate
complement activation that can cause chronic inflammation. The rs1061170 single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) in CFH, substituting a histidine at position 402 (Y402H) in the protein, is found in ~50% of AMD patients.
How this single amino acid change contributes to AMD pathogenesis is unclear. Therefore, the goal of our
proposed studies is to determine why the presence of the high risk CFH variant increases the prevalence of
AMD disease. These studies build on our published work showing increased mtDNA damage in the RPE of AMD
donors with the CFH high-risk SNP and a significant decrease in RPE mt function in induced pluripotent stem
cell (iPSC)-RPE derived from donors harboring the high-risk allele. To accomplish our goal, we will use our
collection of primary RPE and iPSC-derived RPE cultured from individuals phenotyped for AMD disease severity
and genotyped for CFH risk. We will also use gene editing to create reciprocal isogenic iPSC-RPE lines from
parent iPSCs containing either the CFH low or high risk allele. These model systems will be used to investigate
how the presence of the CFH high risk allele alters RPE mt function and the response of RPE to metabolic and
oxidative stressors. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that intracellular complement regulates multiple cellular
pathways that affect mt homeostasis and investigate how the presence of high risk 402H CFH variant protein
alters these processes. Aim 2 will use a global metabolome and proteome approach to test the hypothesis that
there are differences in metabolic and stress responsive pathways in RPE derived from donors with either the
high or low risk CFH genotype. Findings from these studies will provide a comprehensive picture of the role of
CFH in regulating RPE mt function by identifying cellular changes responsible for the loss in mt function and
differences in stress response observed in RPE harboring the CFH high risk allele. This mechanistic insight
could help explain the difference in AMD prevalence in CFH low versus high risk individuals. Knowledge about
these differences may lead to development of therapies targeting the primary defect in a genetically defined
population of AMD patients, which in turn, could lead to a “personalized medicine” approach for treatment of
AMD."
10874605,"Our proposal tests the overarching hypothesis that regional differences in coronary regulation cause micro-
areas of ischemia in the apex of the heart and induce Takotsubo Syndrome. We posit that the level of
ischemia in the ballooning area is not sufficient to produce cell death, but enough of a decrease to invoke an
adaptive program of “myocardial hibernation,” confined to area of ballooning, where the decrease in flow leads
to a decrease in cardiac function. The consequence of apical hibernation is a restoration of the match
between myocardial blood flow and function as the reduced apical function matches the lower myocardial
blood flow, resolving the ischemia. The “benefit” of this hibernation is to prevent irreversible injury, i.e.,
necrosis. To determine if these hypotheses are correct, we have incorporated a multidisciplinary approach that
will not only provide a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of TTS (Aim 1), but will also determine if increasing
blood flow in the apex of the heart exerts a salubrious effect in TTS (Aim 2). Within this context, we propose
two aims: Specific Aim 1. To determine if Takotsubo Syndrome is caused by impaired flow regulation in the
apical regions of the heart leading to micro-areas of myocardial ischemia and a down-regulation of function.
Furthermore, we will determine if the ischemia is abated when function downregulates to match the reduced
flow. This aim will be tested by the following hypotheses: Hypothesis 1. Vasoactive reactions to vasodilators
and vasoconstrictors are different in coronary arterioles from the apex and base of the heart. Hypothesis 2.
During the initial development of TTS, the apex of the heart is ischemic. Hypothesis 3. During the stage of
TTS characterized by apical ballooning, the downregulation of both cardiac function and myocardial blood flow
in the apex eliminates myocardial ischemia and produces apical hibernation. The second specific aim
proposes to determine if improving myocardial blood flow (MBF) will induce recovery of metabolic and
molecular changes induced during Takotsubo Syndrome. This will be tested in the following hypothesis using
two independent mechanisms to increase blood flow: Hypothesis 4. Increasing MBF in the area of ballooning
prevents or restores cardiac, coronary, and metabolic dysfunction. This application builds upon the expertise
and technological capability of research teams at Northeast Ohio Medical University and Cornell University to
decipher mechanisms underlying Takotsubo Syndrome, and to determine whether coronary vasodilation
rescues the abnormalities associated with this syndrome. A comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach is
imbedded in the experimental plan to include measurements of myocardial blood flow (echocardiography)
tissue metabolism and (mass spectrometry), gene expression (RNA seq, RT-PCR), protein expression and
phosphorylation (Western blotting) and cardiac myocyte hypoxia using cardiac myocyte specific hypoxia fate-
mapping."
10874716,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite clinical advances which have resulted in 90% of pediatric patients with late-stage chronic kidney
disease (CKD) surviving to adulthood, the transition to adult care is marked by significant instability and risk of
morbidity, mortality, and shortened lifespans. Underdeveloped self-management and limited decision-making
skills, the result of both biological and system-based barriers, lead to undesirable outcomes such as acute
kidney injury, expedited CKD progression, and allograft loss following transition. The goal of an effective
transition program is to empower pediatric patients and provide them with the necessary tools to support the
move from caregiver (i.e. parents) directed care to disease self-management. Yet, decision-making, a core skill
of self-management, is primarily conducted by caregivers and clinicians on behalf of pediatric patients. The
missed opportunity to practice and develop decision-making skills in a safe and mentored setting contributes to
the poor health-related decisions and self-management by CKD youth. Collaborative decision making (CDM)
recognizes the importance of involving the pediatric patient, eliciting their values and preferences, while also
targeting involvement to the child’s developmental level and capacity. While CDM supports the engagement
among all stakeholders, there is still much to learn about how to best empower CKD youth to assume a more
active role in decision making as they transition to independent self-management. The overall goal of this
research is to explore how a CDM tool can better support CKD youth and provide them with key, lifelong skills
required for successful self-management. In Aim 1, we plan to first understand the current state of CDM with
CKD youth and then define how to best engage CKD youth in CDM (i.e. desired state). This work will result in
a detailed description of the opportunities to support CDM. In Aim 2, we will develop the tools and methods
required to achieve the desired state of CDM and will lead to the development of a youth-focused CDM tool:
Kids CoLab!. Finally, in Aim 3 we will pilot Kids CoLab!, to evaluate if a well-designed CDM tool can support
collaborative decision-making skills, youth engagement in decision-making, and improve outcomes. At the
conclusion of the grant, we will have clearly described how to best support the unique decision-making needs
of CKD youth during their transition to independent self-management."
10874638,"The highly orchestrated muscle activation sequences during motor behaviors are
achieved directly through the fine-tuned firing of motor neurons in the ventral spinal cord. These motor
neurons are mainly regulated by spinal interneurons present in all mammals, which are, in turn, connected to
other spinal neurons as well as various types of descending neurons from the brain including corticospinal
(CS) neurons (CSNs). CSNs located in the motor cortex connect to spinal interneurons to control motor
neuron activity in all species, and thereby coordinate the activity of flexor and extensor limb muscles to control
skilled movements. Although we and others mainly focused on outputs of CSNs through their axons, CSNs
also receive inputs from their presynaptic neurons through their dendrites. However, the identification and
understanding of the function of presynaptic neurons of CSNs (pre-CSNs) remains limited. We developed
rabies virus-based assays to identify pre-CSNs. We hypothesize that each population of pre-CSNs will be
distinctly activated to control discrete phases of skilled movements and muscle activation. To test our
hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will map presynaptic partners of CSNs in the brain. We will further determine whether
those connections are functional (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how pre-CSNs control forelimb skilled
movements and muscle activity (Aim 3). These results will provide the necessary framework for not only
defining spinal motor circuitry, but also subsequent development of novel targeted interventions to treat motor
disabilities."
10896305,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and the third leading cause of death in older
adults. In addition to cognitive impairment, AD is associated with neuropathology, impaired metabolic function
and gut microbiome dysbiosis. However, the relationships between gut health (including the gut microbiome),
metabolism and cognitive decline remains largely unknown, despite strong evidence that the gut-brain-axis is an
important intermediary in neurodegenerative disease. Moreover, normal aging also influences both gut
microbiome composition and peripheral metabolic health, demonstrating the importance of including geroscience
as a factor. Gut dysbiosis can result in impaired insulin resistance as well as obesity, both of which increase the
risk of developing AD. Therefore, the long term goal of this project is to elucidate how altered gut microbiome
composition can influence cognitive outcomes in an aged rat model of AD to identify potential targets for
therapeutic intervention. The overall objective is to investigate whether the gut is able to exert its influence over
cognition through metabolic intermediates, as the gut microbiome directly influences metabolite production and
energy homeostasis. The rationale for this project is that very few, if any, strategies directly targeting brain
function have been able to prevent or delay cognitive impairment with AD to date. This line of investigation is
innovative in that it suggests a peripheral target, rather than targeting the brain directly, for the alleviation of
cognitive symptoms by utilizing the strong, reciprocal link between gut and brain function. Our preliminary data
indicates the TgF344-AD rat model mimics the cognitive decline observed with AD, as well as the peripheral
metabolic impairments and gut dysbiosis associated AD. The proposed experiments will build on these findings
and test the central hypothesis that AD-associated gut dysbiosis negatively influences metabolic function,
thereby impairing cognitive function through an impaired ability to properly utilize and respond to energy
metabolism. Data from humans with AD, as well as our preliminary data, suggest AD-associated gut dysbiosis
negatively influences butyrate production. Depletion of butyrate, the most abundant metabolite produced by the
gut microbiome, is associated with many metabolic diseases including diabetes and obesity, both of which are
commonly associated with AD. Supplementation of butyrate in rodent models can improve insulin sensitivity,
upregulate BDNF and thereby neurogenesis and promote a lean phenotype. Butyrate improves brain health and
metabolism, gut health through supporting the gastrointestinal lining quality and influences microbiome
composition. These synergistic effects make systemic butyrate a therapeutic strategy, or one component of an
effective strategy, with high potential to ameliorate many AD-related impairments in function. Collectively, these
experiments will determine if the gut microbiome influences cognitive outcomes in aged AD-model rats through
a metabolic intermediary and whether this can be ameliorated through probiotic supplementation."

A major purpose of a Phase 3 COBRE Center is to provide a program for identifying and supporting scientifically
worthy pilot projects that will utilize existing COBRE Core Labs and generate preliminary results in support of
new research grant proposals and applications. The CMADP Pilot Projects Program (PPP) will continue its
successful program from Phases 1 & 2. This will be accomplished by broadly advertising new Pilot Project
competitions, obtaining independent internal and/or external reviews of all applications, and consulting with the
EAC to identify new projects to support. The PPP will interact with other components of the Administrative Core
to provide career and research guidance for junior faculty by providing grant writing workshop opportunities
through the KU Office of Research Development, individual mentoring by senior faculty, and monitoring of
scientific progress and career development through monthly CMADP group meetings and interactions with the
External Advisory Committee. The individual COBRE Pilot Projects will, by definition, interact strongly with one
or more of our three COBRE Core Labs."
10893328,"Project Summary
Taxanes are the first and only line of chemotherapy shown to prolong survival in men with metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Taxanes
have not only demonstrated clinical benefits in mCRPC, but also in men with castration-sensitive metastatic
prostate cancer (mCSPC) who received docetaxel given at the time of standard ADT. Despite these clinical
benefits of taxane treatment, not all men respond equally and resistance to therapy leads to significant morbidity
and mortality. Currently, the molecular determinants of clinical response and resistance (intrinsic and acquired)
to taxane chemotherapy remain poorly understood, and new taxane combinations could greatly help patients
with metastatic prostate cancer. We have recently reported that one mechanism for taxane resistance in patients
and mouse models is failure of the drug to stabilize microtubules. The subsequent loss of microtubule bundling
can be quantitated as loss of drug target engagement (DTE), and may be a biomarker for resistance in patients.
Using mouse models we find that increased expression of FOXJ1, a master transcription factor regulating
microtubule-related proteins, as well as a downstream microtubule associated protein TPPP3, are associated
with taxane resistance. Moreover, we find that FOXJ1 gene amplification is associated with taxane treatment in
patients. Recently we have also shown that FOXJ1 overexpression leads to docetaxel resistance in vivo and
that docetaxel treatment leads to an increase in FOXJ1 RNA and protein expression. Aim 1 will focus on
increased FOXJ1 and TPPP3 as mechanisms of resistance, and identification of potential vulnerabilities in these
tumors. In Aim 2 we will explore precision medicine approaches for taxane resistance by examining circulating
tumor cells and plasma cell free DNA in prostate cancer patients being treated with docetaxel to identify
mechanisms of intrinsic or acquired resistance. A goal would be to develop clinical trials of agents targeting
specific resistance mechanisms in these patients. Identification of new mechanisms of resistance to docetaxel
could imminently translate to development of therapeutic combinations to prevent or delay resistance. Our
ultimate goal is to develop new combinations to increase response and survival of patients with metastatic CRPC."
10893329,"ABSTRACT
Anchorage-dependent cells sense the mechanics of their surroundings by pulling and pushing on the
extracellular matrix (ECM), and in response, generate intracellular signals in a process known as
mechanotransduction. Matrix mechanical properties regulate a range of cell behaviors such as traction force
generation, cytoskeletal organization, proliferation, migration, and differentiation, necessitating the
development of in vitro model systems to investigate and understand these cellular phenomena. My lab is at
the forefront of designing hydrogels as in vitro models that move away from static, monolithic constructs and
toward dynamic, interactive, and responsive materials that capture the complexity of native cellular milieus.
The proposed research program will address a critical bottleneck in the field of understanding and exploiting
mechanistic knowledge of cellular mechanotransduction toward addressing health challenges in disease and
tissue regeneration. Theme 1: How Do Time-Dependent Mechanics Affect Cellular
Mechanotransduction? While nearly all synthetic biomaterials present an elastic mechanical environment to
cells, most natural ECM materials are viscoelastic and exhibit complex time-dependent mechanical behavior.
There is still an unmet need for cell culture platforms that permit the design flexibility of synthetic materials
(e.g., spatiotemporal tuning of ligand presentation and stiffness) while also displaying viscoelastic mechanical
properties. This research theme will build on burgeoning efforts from my group to develop viscoelastic
hydrogels in order to test the hypothesis that in 3D cultures viscoelasticity, not stiffness-based signaling, is the
overriding factor required for active mechanotransduction in fibroblast activation and mesenchymal stromal cell
(MSC) differentiation. Theme 2: How Do Mechanics Regulate Growth Factor Signal Transduction? While
recent integral studies have explored the influence of stiffness, ligand presentation, and degradation on stem
cell proliferation and differentiation, little is known about how these properties contribute to transforming growth
factor-β (TGF-β) signal transduction. By investigating the combined influence of substrate biophysical and
biochemical properties, this theme will elucidate design rules for how cellular microenvironments influence the
mechanobiology of growth factor signal transduction, thus providing a framework for the design of biomaterials
that permit more efficient presentation of growth factors. Theme 3: Can We Engineer Thermoresponsive
Biomaterials for Stem Cell Maintenance and Expansion? The ability to efficiently generate large numbers
of specific, well-defined cell types is critical to the treatment of numerous diseases and disorders. This theme
will focus on the creation of thermoresponsive tunable biomaterials to optimize the expansion, maintenance,
and mechanical priming of MSCs, while also enabling facile cell harvesting and validation. Multiple levels of
stimuli-responsiveness will be engineered (e.g., through inclusion of liquid crystalline domains) to permit both
mechanical actuation during culture and subsequent cell release for use in downstream applications."
10893385,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This is a resubmission by Kei Ouchi, MD, MPH, MS for the Paul B. Beeson Emerging Leaders Career
Development Award in Aging (K76). Dr. Ouchi is committed to lead the field of emergency medicine to integrate
the principles of geriatrics and palliative medicine. Dr. Ouchi is an emergency physician and home hospital
physician (provides inpatient-level care at patient’s home10) in the Department of Emergency Medicine, Brigham
and Women’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School. Dr. Ouchi’s research focuses on the development of ED GOAL,
a 6-minute motivational interview conducted in the emergency department (ED), which engages patients to
address advance care planning (ACP) conversations with their outpatient clinicians and avoids a time-
consuming, sensitive conversation in the time-pressured ED environment. With funding from the NIA
GEMSSTAR R03 and Emergency Medicine Foundation, Dr. Ouchi developed ED GOAL and demonstrated its
acceptability and feasibility in seriously ill older adults in the ED. ED GOAL may also increase patients’ self-
reported ACP engagement and ACP documentation after leaving the ED. The GEMSSTAR project identified
that, in this setting where resources are limited, ED GOAL requires refinements to maximize its potential efficacy.
This study will refine ED GOAL to maximize its potential efficacy and scalability, and determine the preliminary
efficacy of the refined ED GOAL to increase ACP engagement one month after leaving the ED. The proposed
5-year training plan accelerates Dr. Ouchi’s career development as an independent physician-scientist through
training in: 1) cognitive impairment assessment and engagement of caregivers in ACP research (ED GOALCG);
2) adaptation of ED GOAL/ ED GOALCG by specially-trained nurses; 3) conducting a clinical trial of ED GOAL/
ED GOALCG administered by specially-trained nurses; and 4) implementation science in preparation for a future
pragmatic clinical trial of ED GOAL/ ED GOALCG. James Tulsky, MD, an internationally recognized researcher
and leader in palliative medicine will serve as the primary mentor. Dr. Ouchi is co-mentored by: 1) Mara
Schonberg, MD, MPH, a leader in health services research among older adults; and 2) Edward Boyer, MD, PhD,
a K24-funded emergency medicine researcher with expertise in behavioral interventions. The culmination of this
career development award will ensure that Dr. Ouchi gains the advanced research skills and knowledge that he
needs to conduct a large, pragmatic trial of ED GOAL. The ultimate goal is to establish ED GOAL as a
national standard of care to help all seriously ill older adults to receive ACP conversations at the most
critical times of their lives. Dr. Ouchi aims to expand the scope of ED-based care from acute, disease-
oriented care (e.g., gunshot wounds) to include patient-centered care (e.g., value-based, end-of-life care)
for seriously ill older adults by integrating geriatrics and palliative medicine principles."
10893386,"Novel approaches to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD)
in older adults are urgently needed given the aging of the population. Over the past decade, observational
research has implicated peripheral hearing loss as being one of the largest potentially modifiable risk factors for
dementia that may account for 8-9% of all dementia cases. Hypothesized pathways underlying this observed
association may be modifiable with hearing loss treatment consisting of the use of hearing technologies (e.g.,
hearing aids) and rehabilitative training. The Aging & Cognitive Health Evaluation in Elders (ACHIEVE) study is
an ongoing, NIA-sponsored Phase III RCT (R01AG055426, MPIs: Lin/Coresh) investigating whether hearing
loss treatment versus an aging education control intervention reduces cognitive decline over a three-year follow-
up period. From 2018-19, we recruited 977 adults ages 70-84 with untreated mild-to-moderate hearing loss who
were randomized 1:1 at baseline (Year 0) to receive hearing intervention (HI; best-practice hearing services and
technologies) versus a successful aging (SA) education control intervention (i.e., one-on-one sessions with a
health educator covering topics important for healthy aging). Participants are currently being followed
semiannually at the ACHIEVE field sites with final Year 3 study visits scheduled from 2021-22. After their Year 3
visit, all participants randomized to the SA education control group will also be offered the hearing intervention.
Final Year 3 results from this original trial will indicate whether hearing intervention (versus a successful aging
control intervention) reduces cognitive decline over a 3-year interval after randomization. We now propose to
continue following the ACHIEVE cohort for an additional 3 years (i.e., up to Year 6) to determine the long-
term effects of hearing intervention (i.e., participants randomized to HI at Year 0) versus successful
aging/delayed HI control (i.e., participants randomized to SA at Year 0 and offered HI after their Year 3
visit) on cognitive and brain outcomes. Given that cognitive impairment typically reflects the slow
accumulation of pathologic changes, the benefits of HI in slowing this decline may not be fully appreciable within
just 3 years. Therefore, this 6-year follow-up of the cohort will allow us to fully evaluate the longer, cumulative
impact of HI on older adults. Such findings will complement the main trial results in 2023 and directly inform
clinical and policy decisions around the potential use of hearing interventions to reduce the risk of ADRD. This
proposed study has the following aims: Aim 1 To determine the long-term effect of HI versus SA/Delayed HI
control on rates of the co-primary outcomes of: (a) cognitive decline and (b) incident mild cognitive impairment
(MCI)/dementia. Aim 2 To determine the long-term effect of HI versus SA/Delayed HI control on changes in
brain MRI measures of: (a) regional brain volumes and (b) white matter tract integrity. Secondary Aims: 1) To
investigate potential factors contributing to HI treatment effect heterogeneity; 2) To investigate health care
expenditures and utilization between the HI vs SA/Delayed HI control groups by analyzing Medicare claims data."
10893388,"My group is working to develop NMR-assisted crystallography – the synergistic combination of
solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray crystallography, and computational chemistry – as an
atomic-resolution probe of enzyme active sites, capable of defining the position of all atoms, including
hydrogens. By locating hydrogen atoms, this technique provides the often critical missing chemical
information necessary to link structure and mechanism, as well as providing crucial information for the rational
design of therapeutics. The approach is three-fold: X-ray crystallography is used to provide a coarse structural
framework upon which chemically-detailed models of the active site are built using computational chemistry,
and various active site chemistries explored; these models can be quantitatively distinguished by comparing
their predicted NMR chemical shifts with the results from solid-state NMR experiments. Provided a sufficient
number of chemical shift restraints are measured within the active site, NMR-assisted crystallography can
uniquely identify the structure. The targeted systems include pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP)-dependent
enzymes, which have been implicated in numerous health conditions and as targets for treating diseases, and
the β-Lactamases, which mediate antibiotic resistance to β-lactam antibiotics.
 The family of PLP-dependent enzymes are involved in the metabolism of amino acids and other amine-
containing biomolecules. This single cofactor can participate in a diverse array of chemical transformations,
including racemization, transamination, α/β-decarboxylation, and α/β/γ- elimination and substitution.
Understanding how active sites fine-tune the same cofactor for such varied reactions is a primary objective of
this proposal. To accomplish this understanding, NMR-assisted crystallography is employed to characterize
these enzymatic transformations with atomic resolution. In tryptophan synthase, this allows us to peer along
the reaction coordinates into and out of multiple intermediates. Here the protonation states complete the
chemical picture for why, for example, specific inhibitors such as benzimidazole are unable to react to form a
covalent bond as it is held in the wrong orientation by hydrogen bonds to βGlu109 and the charged ε-amino
group of βLys87.
 A second goal is to extend the successes in characterizing enzymatic transformations in PLP-dependent
enzymes to the β-lactamases, starting with the Toho-1 β-lactamase. Here we build on our initial chemical shift
assignments and characterization of dynamics in solution to study the chemical mechanism used to inhibit
antibiotics. In this application, NMR-assisted crystallography will be developed at the interface with neutron
crystallography, which to date has been unable to solve the structure in the presence of an inhibitor, but where
understanding the mechanism at the chemical level requires that we assign the protonation states of the key
active site acid/base catalytic residues."

The primary concept of NH-INBRE is that using available resources to support biomedical
research by faculty and students at the Partners is central to accomplishing all NH-INBRE
goals. NH-INBRE has established a diverse array of programs outside of the mandated
Developmental Research Project Program, Bioinformatics Core and Administrative Core (AC)
to support biomedical research at the Partners. As these programs have increased in number,
evolved and become more complex, we determined, through internal and external evaluation
and Steering Committee (SC) input, that consolidating these programs into a Research and
Training Core (RTC) would optimize their impact, improve network communication and better
coordinate these programs with all other NH-INBRE programs. We propose establishing a
Research and Training Core to be directed by the Program Coordinator with major decisions
made by the AC with input from the SC and the External Advisory Committee. Focus of the
RTC will be 1) Improving communications to the Partners on the original and recently
developed NH-INBRE programs that collectively support robust and diverse research,
education and training to faculty, trainees and staff; 2) Organizing in close collaboration with
the DRPP and Bioinformatics/Genomics Core all scientific advising and mentoring of student,
postdoc and faculty researchers; 3) Augmenting Partner infrastructure – e.g.
equipment/services, lab space and 4) Collaborating with internal evaluation expert, Sharon
O’Connor (see AC Section) and external EAC and AAAS advisors so as to periodically assess
all RTC programs to better fulfill NH-INBRE goals. Resources administered through the RTC
come from NH-INBRE funding as well as extensive institutional support from both Leads and
Partners."

A central component of NH-INBRE is its Developmental Research Projects Program (DRPP). The DRPP
component provides 1) research opportunities and training for students; 2) professional development for
DRPP-funded Project Leaders (PLs) and students; 3) development of the research and science culture at
Partners. Through this mechanism, NH-INBRE directs resources to support the best biomedical research at
Partners through multiple mechanisms to faculty from our 7 four-year primarily undergraduate Partner
Institutions.
The DRPP aims to direct NH-INBRE resources to support the best biomedical research at Partners and
provides multiple mechanisms to support this through Pilot Project (PP), Research Project (RP) grants, and the
new Targeted Incentive Grant(TIGs) and Seed Grant program.
The DRPP develops and releases funding opportunity announcements to NH-INBRE participating institutions
that solicit research proposals from faculty members. The proposals that fit into the biomedical themes of NH-
INBRE then undergo anonymous peer review and are ranked according to perceived merit. Both scientific merit
and the ability of the project and its Principal Investigator to provide a solid research experience for
undergraduate students participating in the project are considered. Funding is awarded based on this ranking."
10894015,"SUMMARY – PROJECT 1
Nationally, 73.6% of adults are overweight or obese. Rural populations and persons living in low-income
households have high rates of obesity. The greatest disparities in obesity prevalence between urban and rural
counties are in the southern United States. Arkansas has the sixth highest proportion of rural population (~41%)
and the third highest obesity prevalence (37.4%). The CDC estimates 18.5% of children age 2-19 in the US are
obese. Arkansas has the third highest rate of obesity for high school students (22.1%) and the fifth highest rate
for children in ages 10-17 (20.2%). Obesity contributes to increased diabetes incidence, cancer incidence and
mortality, and cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality among rural communities. This application seeks
funding to evaluate a Comprehensive School Nutrition Enrichment Intervention (CSNEI) for the first time in rural
schools. The primary research question is: “Compared with demographically similar school districts that did not
implement the CSNEI, does the CSNEI policy intervention yield improved obesity prevention outcomes among
rural K-12 students?” We will conduct a matched-pairs cluster randomized trial with pre-test and repeated post-
tests in 6 school districts, 3 implementing CSNEI and 3 matched comparison school districts. The evaluation will
include ~11,500 students in 6 school districts: ~5,750 from CSNEP school districts and ~5,750 from matched
comparison school districts. The study will explore heterogeneity of treatment effects for race/ethnicity, sex, age,
and economic status to understand effects on populations most at risk for obesity. Our specific aims are: Aim
1.A Evaluate the effects of a CSNEI on students' relative (accounting for age and sex) BMI change over time.
Aim 1.B Evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of a CSNEI on the nutritional quality of food served in
school meals. Aim 1.C Evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of a CSNEI on students' consumption of
food served in school meals. Aim 1.D Evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of a CSNEI on students'
skin carotenoid levels, as an indicator of fruit and vegetable intake. Aim 2 Conduct an implementation study to
document barriers and facilitators of CSNEI implementation in rural schools. We will complete the first
implementation study of a CSNEI in rural schools, which will provide critical information to ensure successful
implementation of similar interventions in school districts and will be an innovative step to accelerate translation
of evidence into broad practice. Existing paradigms for the study of comprehensive school nutrition interventions
do not appropriately address needs and potential barriers of rural children, particularly those living in low-income
households. This study will fill critical gaps in evidence by rigorously evaluating a CSNEI in rural schools with high
proportions of students eligible for free and reduced price meals (>50%); employing a matched-pairs cluster
randomized design to compare changes in BMI z-scores over time; and incorporating economic status, age (in
months), sex, and race/ethnicity in the analyses."
10894022,"SUMMARY – PROJECT 2
Blacks/African Americans have the highest cigarette smoking-attributable cancer mortality rates in the United
States. Cigarette smoking is nearly double the national average (23%-26%) in Arkansas rural counties where
more than 48% of the population is Black/African American. Social structural stressors such as persistent
poverty, low educational attainment, high rates of unemployment, the COVID-19 pandemic, poor transportation,
poor access to health care, and historical oppression pose tremendous barriers to successful quitting. Quitting
smoking can substantially reduce cancer morbidity and mortality among African Americans, but successful
quitting as well as the reach of evidence-based interventions to rural African Americans is alarmingly low. Few
studies have empirically tested the efficacy of social structural interventions (home-based food delivery) that
address the dynamic interplay of cancer risk behaviors, like smoking, and social factors that perpetuate
disparities like food insecurity. The long-term goal of this study is to fill a critical gap in knowledge on the role of
social structural interventions in the elimination of cancer health disparities in low resource rural Arkansas
counties with high proportions of Blacks/African Americans and high smoking prevalence. Our aims are to 1) test
the efficacy of a social change intervention (home-based food delivery) on smoking abstinence using a 3-armed
randomized controlled design, 2) examine changes in measures of cigarette abuse liability, and 3) examine the
extent to which home-based food delivery improves recruitment and retention of Black/African American smokers
in the treatment conditions. Our academic-community partnership – the University of Arkansas for Medical
Sciences, Coalition for a Tobacco Free Arkansas, and the Arkansas Foodbank – has a strong collaborative
foundation and experience in working together to reduce tobacco use in rural Arkansas Delta counties with high
proportions of Blacks/African Americans. Multilevel interventions are needed to address persistent social
conditions that potentially increase the abuse liability of smoking and impede successful quitting. Smokers who
are more food insecure are less likely to quit smoking. Our multidisciplinary team will use the Socioecological
Model to test our central hypothesis: smokers who receive evidence-based real-time video-based motivational
counseling and a social change intervention (home-based food delivery) will have greater cotinine-verified 7-day
point prevalence abstinence than those who receive motivational counseling alone or social change alone.
Social structural interventions that meet the immediate social needs of Black/African American smokers hold
tremendous promise for improving Black/African American recruitment and retention into helpful cancer
prevention community trials, increasing successful quitting, and reducing social disparities that perpetuate
tobacco-caused cancer disparities."
10894158,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We have made great advances in our ability to treat cancer. However, we still lack the ability to determine which
patients will benefit the most from treatment. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the decision
to treat with radiation and chemotherapy is based on anatomical evaluations of tumor stage and progression. In
addition, treatment response is evaluated several weeks post-completion of therapy. An early determination of
treatment resistance would greatly alleviate the pain and suffering for patients with treatment-resistant tumors
who would otherwise undergo several weeks of ineffective therapy. Three research teams with complementary
expertise in diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and radiation biology have joined forces to
develop a non-invasive, quantitative tool that can reveal key metabolic, functional and molecular changes in
response to radiation and chemotherapy in HNSCC. Specifically, this multi-modal optical sensing approach
affords simultaneous, real-time determination of tumor oxygenation and metabolism that play key
complementary roles in shaping treatment resistance. The integration of diffuse reflectance and Raman
spectroscopic modalities is motivated by our preliminary data acquired from radiation-resistant and sensitive
tumor xenografts that shows significantly higher reoxygenation and elevated lipid and glycogen content in the
radiation-resistant tumors. This application seeks to significantly advance these preliminary findings for
comprehensive characterization of radiation and chemotherapeutic responses. Aim 1 is focused on pre-clinical
studies using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to investigate short-term and long-term reoxygenation kinetics of
chemo and radiation-resistant and sensitive tumors in response to clinical treatment regimens and, in the
process, identify time-dependent thresholds that can reliably predict radiation resistance. In Aim 2, we will
investigate the dynamic changes in tumor metabolism after radiation and chemotherapy using Raman
spectroscopy and correlate these findings with metabolomics to map the key spectral features to molecular
determinants. Finally, in Aim 3, we seek to translate the consolidated panel of spectroscopic markers through a
pilot clinical study in patients with HNSCC who are scheduled for chemoradiation therapy. To determine the
initial sensitivity of our approach in identifying treatment-resistant tumors within the first half of the therapeutic
regimen, we will develop and employ a multimodal inverse spatially offset Raman and diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy probe that is compatible with a standard clinical laryngoscope. Successful completion of these aims
will delineate functional and molecular changes associated with radiation and chemoresistance at unprecedented
time scales. This knowledge of radiobiological changes occurring immediately after therapy will not only aid in
differentiating treatment responders and non-responders but also identify additional time points at which
meaningful changes to therapy could improve treatment response rates."

Kidney diseases are an expanding public health problem, currently affecting 37 million people and are the 9th
leading cause of death in the US, while disproportionately accounting for ~27% of Medicare expenditures.
Unfortunately, the number of randomized clinical trials has been fewer than all other specialties of internal
medicine with very low success rates, likely due to the structural and functional complexity of the kidney. The
multicellular architecture and unusual triad of physiological processes characterized by glomerular filtration,
tubular secretion, and tubular reabsorption have limited the ability of animal models to recapitulate the diversity
of etiologies, mechanisms, and heterogenous manifestations of most human kidney diseases. Additionally,
until recently there has been a lack of in vitro models that recapitulate critical aspects of kidney physiology,
mimic the unique complexities of specific nephron segments, or assess reparative mechanisms in response
to injury. In response to this critical unmet need, our group has pioneered the development of `human kidney
on a chip' microphysiological systems (MPS). Our integrated approach for in vitro disease modeling includes
differentiating human kidney cells and organoids from diseased patient-derived inducible pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs), CRISPR gene editing, single cell transcriptional profiling and engineered MPS platforms for both
living human kidney vascular networks and tubular units. This approach has already led us to achieve new
mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD, the leading
monogenetic cause of kidney failure) and potential new therapeutic pathways. In parallel, significant efforts
led by us are underway in the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (known as NEPTUNE) and the Kidney
Precision Medicine Project, NIH funded Consortia designed to address the functional heterogeneity of kidney
disease by rigorous molecular, histologic and phenotypic characterization of kidney diseases. The NCATS
Rare Disease Clinical Network NEPTUNE is testing the precision medicine concept by matching individual
molecular profiles from patients to targeted therapy trials. We now propose to leverage these field-leading
tools to inform clinical trial design and planning, accounting for human genetic and clinical response
heterogeneity for PKD and Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), the form of nephrotic syndrome with
the most severe patient consequences. Based on our data, we hypothesize that kidney-on-a-chip MPS will
manifest patient-specific phenotypic responses in vitro commensurate with clinical trial outcomes in vivo,
establishing a robust molecular and cellular basis for kidney precision medicine approaches. We have
established a multidisciplinary investigative team with all the field-leading expertise needed to address all
technical and experimental challenges."
10897831,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fatty liver potentiates alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) development. AKAP12 (A-kinase anchoring protein
12) is a scaffolding protein in signal transduction by anchoring protein kinases (PKA, PKC), cyclin-D1 and heat
shock protein 47. Our recent proteomics studies showed that AKAP12 exhibited decreased interaction with
kinases and increased interaction with phosphatases by alcohol in mouse models and human ALD. This led us
to examine whether alcohol regulated AKAP12 phosphorylation. By phospho-peptide mapping we determined
that alcohol strongly inhibited AKAP12 phosphorylation in mouse liver. AKAP12’s alcohol-sensitive phospho-
sites were mainly PKA-predicted substrates. Mutating these phospho-sites reduced the stability of AKAP12
protein, suggesting that phosphorylation stabilized AKAP12. The AKAP12 interactome revealed its interactions
with proteins known to regulate lipid homeostasis such as PKA, 2-adrenergic receptor (2-AR) and lipolytic
enzymes, adipose-triglyceride lipase (ATGL). We therefore assessed the functional role of this AKAP12
interactome in hepatocytes. It was shown previously that AKAP12-mediated PKA scaffolding recruits it to 2-
AR. The signalosome of AKAP12, PKA and 2-AR regulates cAMP levels through the process of 2-AR de-
sensitization/re-sensitization and may involve AKAP12 phosphorylation. 2-AR/PKA/cAMP signaling limits lipid
accumulation and enhances lipolysis. Our novel preliminary data indicates that alcohol exposure dysregulates
several components of the AKAP12/PKA/2-AR signalosome. Alcohol inhibited the interaction between PKA and
2-AR. AKAP12 was highly phosphorylated at a S696-S698 PKA-phospho-site that was previously published to
facilitate AKAP12-2-AR binding. This site exhibited decreased phosphorylation upon alcohol exposure and
mutating this AKAP12 site reduced its scaffolding towards both PKA and 2-AR. This AKAP12 mutation also
reduced 2-AR protein stability. Alcohol interfered with AKAP12-2-AR interaction and facilitated AKAP12 and
2-AR lysosomal degradation. Based on these data, we hypothesize that decreased AKAP12 phosphorylation
following alcohol exposure might interfere with AKAP12/PKA/2-AR signalosome, causing alterations in cAMP
signaling, which in turn could dysregulate lipid homeostasis. Preliminary data that support this hypothesis are:
1) Enhancing endogenous AKAP12 levels reverses the inhibitory effect of alcohol on PKA-2-AR interaction; 2)
AKAP12 induction inhibits alcohol-mediated increase of triglyceride levels; 3) AKAP12 induction reverses
alcohol’s suppressive effect on fatty acid oxidation. Induction of AKAP12 also reverses alcohol’s suppressive
effect on the activity of lipolytic enzyme, ATGL. Whether the AKAP12/PKA/2-AR scaffold controls lipid
homeostasis is unknown. We hypothesize that dysregulation of the AKAP12 signalosome favors lipid
accumulation. This proposal will evaluate how alcohol-sensitive AKAP12 phosphorylation destabilizes AKAP12,
impairs its scaffolding activities and contributes to dysregulation of lipid homeostasis. The therapeutic benefit of
AKAP12 phospho-stabilization in ameliorating lipid dysfunction will be tested in mouse models of ALD."

Heterogeneity in spatial and temporal dimensions is a hallmark of mammalian cell membranes. This partitions
cellular membranes into distinct nanodomains distinguished by specific lipid-lipid or lipid-protein interactions.
These nanodomains provide a dynamic, spatiotemporally organized platform for membrane-localized regulation
of critical signaling pathways, imparting unique organization and bioactivity to the signaling proteins (and their
effectors/substrates) that are associated with or embedded in them. This regulation of membrane proteins by their
endogenous microenvironment is fundamental to critical biological functions and is often impaired in diseases
such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and immune disorders.
 Despite the significance of the native membrane milieu in modulating membrane protein functions, there is
a scarcity of experimental approaches for studying membrane proteins in their native lipid environment with
simultaneous spatial, temporal, and molecular resolution. Motivated by this inherent challenge, my goal is to
develop an experimental platform to understand the hierarchical and functional organization of membrane
proteins in an endogenous cell membrane environment with precise spatial and molecular resolution. I will use
an amphipathic styrene-maleic acid copolymer (SMA and its chemical analogs) to excise circular patches of the
cell membrane, generating ~10-15 nm-sized “native nanodiscs”. SMA-encapsulated membrane proteins of
interest are surrounded by an annular ring of endogenous lipids and interacting proteins, preserving their local
membrane microenvironments and offering unprecedented spatial resolution. Following further enrichment and
purification, I will use single-molecule TIRF microscopy, native mass spectrometry, lipidomics and proteomics,
functional assays, and structural studies to investigate the biophysical and biochemical properties of these SMA-
encapsulated membrane proteins within their endogenous environment.
 I will study two clinically relevant membrane/membrane-associated proteins using this approach – (1) KRas,
a small GTPase that is a prominent oncogene with >95% mutation frequency in pancreatic cancers, and (2) Trk
family receptor tyrosine kinases that bind neurotrophins and are central to neuronal development, differentiation,
and survival and are implicated in pain perception. I will address outstanding questions about the structural and
functional organization of these proteins on the native membrane, how the spatially enriched proteome and
lipidome around these proteins regulate their organization, how that influences the biological activity of these
membrane proteins, and ultimately how that impacts downstream signaling. The direct involvement of protein-
lipid interaction and dynamics in several diseases necessitates a quantitative understanding of membrane proteins
in their native membrane milieu. My proposal outlines a general experimental pipeline with a broad and
transformative impact on understanding the regulation and activation of membrane proteins in the context of their
endogenous environment with precise spatial and molecular resolution."

Selective interactions between neurons and non-neuronal cells are crucial for the development and function of
neural circuits. Pain-sensing somatosensory neurons project peripheral axons to the skin, where they branch
extensively amongst epithelial epidermal cells. Although these sensory terminals are called “free endings”,
recent studies have revealed that they are often wrapped by epidermal cells, which enclose them into
ensheathment channels reminiscent of those formed by non-myelinating Remak Schwann cells. Although
underappreciated, epidermal ensheathment channels have been observed in worms, flies, fish, and mammals,
indicating that ensheathment is a conserved feature of epidermal sensory endings, and thus likely plays critical
roles in the development and function of nociceptive axons. Little is known about the morphogenetic process of
axon ensheathment by epidermal cells, and nothing is known about how these structures contribute to sensory
function or disease in vertebrate animals.
This proposal investigates the morphogenetic mechanisms that create epidermal ensheathment channels and
how they contribute to sensory function in zebrafish larvae. Their external development and the availability of
unique transgenic tools make zebrafish an ideal model for studying this dynamic morphogenetic process.
Preliminary work using live fluorescent reporters for subcellular structures in zebrafish skin cells identified a
sequence of events leading up to ensheathment and suggested a step-wise morphogenetic process. First,
axons growing into this epidermis induce the formation of specialized lipid microdomains at skin cell-axon
contact sites. Second, F-actin is recruited to these microdomains, likely promoting membrane invagination to
initiate the ensheathment process. Finally, adherens junctions and desmosomes form at “necks” of
ensheathment channels to tightly seal the channels. The first two aims of this proposal use innovative
microscopy approaches for high spatial and temporal resolution live imaging, cell-specific molecular
manipulations, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis to determine how axons and skin cells establish
selective interactions and execute the ensheathment process. These studies will illuminate morphogenetic
mechanisms relevant not just to axon ensheathment by epidermal and glial cells, but also to basic cellular
processes, like the formation of membrane signaling domains and junction assembly. The third aim combines
imaging and behavioral assays to reveal how axon ensheathment impacts neuronal structure and function.
These studies have the potential to uncover a critical feature of the touch-sensing apparatus and suggest how
ensheathment contributes to disease conditions affecting pain and touch sensation."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in women in the US and globally. Menopausal
transition poses remarkably elevated risk of CVD making postmenopausal women a population of special
attention. There is an increasing concern about the exposure to environmental chemicals, particularly persistent
organic pollutants (POPs), that disrupt human endocrine milieu and adversely affect cardiovascular health. The
bioaccumulation of POPs over lifetime induces significant long-term health impact, especially among older
population. However, the long-term effect of POPs on subclinical atherosclerosis progression, an early
pathological feature of CVD, has not been studied well in postmenopausal women. In addition, the effect of POPs
on atherosclerosis progression has not been evaluated in the US population. To our knowledge, no longitudinal
study has been conducted to investigate the effects of POP mixtures and atherosclerosis progression. The only
longitudinal study reporting an adverse effect of a specific class of POPs, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
(PFASs), on increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT, ultrasound) over 10 years was from a Swedish
senior cohort. To fill the gaps in our understanding, we will investigate the long-term associations of plasma
POPs concentrations and atherosclerosis progression in postmenopausal women in a unique cohort; Early vs
Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol (ELITE) with 5-year longitudinal measurements of subclinical carotid
atherosclerosis including gold-standard ultrasound measures (IMT, echogenicity, and stiffness) and frozen
plasma samples to analyze absolute concentrations of 60 POPs from four main classes (polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs), and
(PFASs). ELITE is a randomized clinical trial including 596 early (<6years since menopause) and late (≥10years
since menopause) postmenopausal women comparing rates of atherosclerosis progression over 5 years
between women randomized to hormone therapy (HT) and placebo. Beyond the goal of investigating the effect
of POP mixtures on atherosclerosis progression, we will investigate the impact of POP mixtures on risk factors
of atherosclerosis including metabolic (lipids, glucose, HbA1c, and insulin resistance) and inflammatory
biomarkers. Important covariates including the design factors (HT and placebo, early and late-postmenopausal
groups), obesity, smoking, diet, and physical activity will be adjusted for in the analysis. To assess the
generalizability of the adverse effect of POP exposure across various subgroups of postmenopausal women, we
will evaluate POPs’ associations with atherosclerosis progression in subgroups of women randomized to HT and
placebo, as well as early and late postmenopausal groups. This study will provide important evidence on long-
term effect of POP mixtures on atherosclerosis progression and related metabolic and inflammatory
pathophysiology among postmenopausal women who are at high risk of CVD. Findings from this study will help
identify key individual and subgroups of POPs as targets for regulations, remediations, and CVD prevention."

 Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease that requires intensive daily management to maintain
adequate glycemic control and prevent diabetes-related complications. Less than 20% of individuals meet the
American Diabetes Association goal hemoglobin A1c level for adequate glycemic control. Use of diabetes
technologies, and specifically continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), are the standard of care, and improve
glycemic control, health related quality of life and treatment satisfaction. Despite these benefits, CGMs are
underutilized, particularly in minorities and individuals from underserved communities. Increasing uptake and
continued use of CGM can help improve glycemic control and mitigate disparities in diabetes-related outcomes
for underserved individuals.
 There are many barriers to CGM use at the patient, provider and systems levels, yet there are no
proven interventions to address these barriers. In a pilot study at our institution, we demonstrated that
placement of trial CGM with standardized education at the point of care increases CGM uptake, but
overcoming the knowledge barrier is insufficient to ensure personal and sustained use of CGM. The objective
of this project is to build upon our pilot study to implement a novel intervention in the real-world clinical setting
that is feasible, sustainable and generalizable to increase CGM uptake across the lifespan - including pediatric,
emerging adults, and adults with T1D.
 We hypothesize that implementing the support of a diabetes navigator with trial CGM placement
at the point of care will increase CGM uptake and sustained use, leading to improvements in glycemic
control that will mitigate disparities in diabetes related outcomes for underserved individuals with T1D.
In this proposal, we will first (Aim 1) refine the role and toolkit of the diabetes navigator based on stakeholder
feedback on solutions to address barriers to CGM uptake and sustained use. Building on the experience from
our pilot study, the formative phase of Aim 1, and leveraging the collective expertise of our multidisciplinary
study team, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial (Aim 2) of 136 individuals with T1D, including 60
children and adolescents and 76 adults, not currently using CGM. Participants will be randomized to (Arm 1)
standard of care trial CGM placement (n=68), or (Arm 2) the intervention arm with trial CGM placement with
the support from a diabetes navigator (n=68). We hypothesize that the diabetes navigator arm will have higher
CGM uptake and sustained use, with (Aim 3) greater improvements in glycemic control and patient-related
outcomes, compared to the standard of care arm. If the diabetes navigator is successful in increasing CGM
uptake and sustained use, and is demonstrated to be a feasible, acceptable and sustainable intervention that
can be applied to the larger diabetes community, it has the potential to improve diabetes care and mitigate
disparities in diabetes related outcomes for underserved communities with T1D."

The development of clinical biomarker tests to assess risk of recurrence in ER+ breast cancer patients has led
to dramatic improvements in patient care and outcomes, including the de-escalation of chemotherapy and
reduction of adverse side-effects for women with good prognosis. There are currently no clinical biomarker tests
available to assess risk of recurrence in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients or HER2+ breast cancer
patients. These patients are all treated with aggressive chemotherapy, and often suffer from long-term adverse
side-effects, because oncologists have no way of knowing which patients inherently have a good prognosis.
We recently discovered that expression of the MHC Class II antigen presentation pathway (MHCII) and the
presence of tumor infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) was associated with long-term disease-free survival (DFS) in
TNBC and HER2+ breast cancer patients. We developed a multigene expression assay compatible with formalin
fixed paraffin embedded breast tumor specimens that can accurately quantify MHCII expression and TILs to
generate an Immune Activation Score for each patient. We confirmed that the Immune Activation Score could
identify patients who have a very low risk of recurrence in an independent institutional cohort. Interestingly,
patients with high MHCII and TIL expression have long-term disease-free survival regardless of whether they
received chemotherapy. Additionally, mouse studies show that MHCII expression in tumors increases TILs and
protects from recurrence in the absence of chemotherapy, and other groups have recently reported that TNBC
patients with high TILs have improved DFS even without receiving chemotherapy. These data suggest that the
MHCII Immune Activation Assay can identify TNBC and HER2+ patients who have a very low risk of recurrence.
The primary objective of this UH3 proposal is to validate that the MHCII Immune Activation assay can be used
to identify TNBC and HER2+ breast cancer patients who have a very low risk of recurrence by analyzing clinical
trials specimens in a CLIA-certified laboratory. Specific Aim 1 analyzes tumors from a large trial of adjuvant
chemotherapy in TNBC and HER2+ patients, and Specific Aim 2 analyzes biopsies from TNBC patients who
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). This ensures the assay is prognostic using different specimen types
and treatment timing. A secondary objective is to determine if the assay can identify good prognosis patients
who do equally well regardless of whether their chemotherapy regimens include paclitaxel. Exploratory
objectives include determining if high Immune Activation Scores are predictive of pathological complete response
to NAC, and determining if MHCII Immune Activation Scores change after NAC and are associated with DFS.
The successful completion of this study could produce the first biomarker assay for identifying TNBC and
HER2+ breast cancer patients who have a low risk of recurrence. It would also enable future clinical trials to
utilize the assay for selective enrollment of good prognosis patients to evaluate less toxic treatment regimens."

PAR-18-30 “Development and Optimization of Tasks and Measures for Functional Domains of Behavior”
encourages research projects that will develop and optimize new or existing tasks and measures for the
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). This call stems from workgroups of the National Advisory Mental Health
Council that identified significant gaps in the RDoC measurement toolkit. In the negative valence systems (NVS)
domain, one priority area is the need for behavioral paradigms for identifying areas of overlap and distinction
between NVS, which motivate defensive avoidance behaviors, and positive valence systems (PVS),
which motivate reward-approach behaviors. We contend that approach-avoidance (AP-AV) paradigms
offer a promising solution. AP-AV tasks are essentially behavioral approach tests that enable assessment
of overt behavioral responses to acute threats. The aims of this proposal are to demonstrate the (1)
psychometric adequacy (test-retest reliability) and (2) diagnostic/predictive validity of a user-friendly
instructed AP-AV-task we’ve developed for assessing psychosocial dysfunction associated with anxiety,
depression, psychosis, and other conditions. Our aims build upon extensive preliminary research in our
lab devoted to optimizing task parameters, measures and administration. This work has the potential to
yield an easy-to-use and widely disseminable AP-AV task for identifying areas of overlap and distinction
between NVS and PVS, as well as a general AP-AV methodology that is adaptable for assessing overt
behavioral responses to acute threats. To achieve these aims, we will recruit three matched groups of adults
(healthy, elevated social anxiety, and elevated social anhedonia). Inclusion of groups with anxiety and
anhedonia are necessary to assess diagnostic and predictive validity. Participants will complete
standardized clinical assessments and complete the instructed AP-AV task multiple times during two
neuroimaging sessions, separated by 10-14 days. Between imaging sessions, ecological momentary
assessments (EMA) will capture mood, motivational level, frequency of real-life approach/avoidance,
and emotional regulation strategy use. This research is theoretically significant because it highlights the
relevance of theories of AP-AV motivation for research devoted to identifying areas of overlap and distinction
between NVS and PVS. This research is methodologically innovative because it will produce a user-friendly
AP-AV task with strong psychometric properties for use in behavioral (stand-alone) or neuroimaging
research. Outcome data will also provide the necessary empirical foundation for future investigations into the
suitability of AP-AV tasks for use with individuals who vary widely in age, ability, and/or severity of disorder."

Aphasia is a devastating complication of stroke. Speech and language treatment (SLT) can be helpful in restoring
language function, but not all individuals show improvement. Recent studies indicate that Transcranial Direct
Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a promising adjuvant approach to enhance the effectiveness of SLT. tDCS is a
noninvasive, non-painful, electrical stimulation of the brain. It is believed that tDCS boosts neural plasticity that
underlies recovery with SLT. A majority of the tDCS studies of aphasia have stimulated the left hemisphere
regions. However, left hemisphere lesions common in post-stroke aphasia affect the electrical field in
unpredictable ways, potentially preventing stimulation from reaching perilesional tissue associated with optimal
recovery. Our work addressed this problem by stimulating a novel region, the right cerebellum. The right
cerebellum is connected to the left hemisphere and involved in a variety of cognitive and language functions,
including naming, which is often impaired in people with aphasia. The PI's prior work shows that cerebellar tDCS
is safe, easily tolerated, and improved language skills in a number of stroke participants with aphasia. The
proposed project will build on these findings by conducting a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, trial to
determine the effectiveness of cathodal tDCS to the right cerebellum for the treatment of post-stroke aphasia.
We will compare the effects of 15 sessions of cerebellar tDCS combined with an evidenced-based anomia
treatment (semantic feature analysis, SFA) to 15 sessions of sham combined with SFA treatment in patients with
chronic (at least 6 months post stroke) aphasia. We will evaluate the effects of cerebellar tDCS on naming
untrained items as well as the effects on functional communication, content, efficiency, and word-retrieval of
picture description, and quality of life. This project will also identify imaging and linguistic biomarkers to determine
the characteristics of stroke patients that benefit from cerebellar tDCS and SFA treatment. Individual response
to tDCS treatment is highly variable, and little is known about how factors related to imaging and linguistic
characteristics combine to induce treatment responsiveness. We will carry out resting state functional magnetic
resonance imaging (rsfMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), high resolution structural imaging, and detailed
linguistic testing before the start of treatment to determine whether these factors can predict response to
cerebellar tDCS and/or SFA. The long-term aim of this study is to provide the basis for a Phase III randomized
controlled trial of cerebellar tDCS vs sham with concurrent SLT for treatment of chronic aphasia."

 Intracellular Ca2+ signaling via changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration controls a wide range of cellular
and physiologic processes. Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores mediated by second messengers plays a
critical role in regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is the
most potent Ca2+-mobilizing second messenger identified to date; it uniquely mobilizes Ca2+ from acidic
endolysosomal organelles. NAADP has been shown to be effective in evoking Ca2+ release in a multitude of
different mammalian cells and defects in NAADP signaling are now being implicated in many diseases. Despite
the importance of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signaling, the molecular basis of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release remains
largely unclear. With immobilized NAADP–based affinity purification and quantitative proteomic analyses of
NAADP and TPC interacting proteins, we identified Lsm12 to be a shared interacting partner of NAADP, TPC1,
and TPC2. Lsm12 directly binds to NAADP via its Lsm domain, colocalizes with TPC2, and mediates the
apparent association of NAADP to isolated TPC2 or TPC2-containing membranes. Lsm12 is essential and
immediately participates in NAADP-evoked TPC activation and Ca2+ mobilization. Our findings thus reveal a
putative RNA-binding protein functioning as an NAADP receptor and a TPC regulatory protein and provide a
new molecular basis for understanding the mechanisms of NAADP signaling. Our further studies showed that
Lsm12 has multifaceted function by affecting TPC channel gating properties and functioning in non-TPC
dependent NAADP signaling. We hypothesize that: 1) Lsm12 as an NAADP receptor achieves its high
selectivity and affinity to NAADP than NADP via its Lsm domain; 2) Lsm12 mediates TPC channel activation by
NAADP via protein-protein interactions and/or dephosphorylation; and 3) Lsm12 can regulate multiple ion
channels and mediate NAADP-evoked intracellular Ca2+ elevation via shared mechanisms. To test our
hypotheses, we will pursue the following 3 specific aims. Aim 1. Determine the molecular mechanism of the
Lsm domain in NAADP binding. Aim 2. Determine the molecular mechanisms of Lsm12-mediated TPC
activation by NAADP. Aim 3. Determine the multifaceted function of Lsm12 in NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signaling.
Findings from the proposed research will elucidate the molecular mechanisms and function of NAADP/Lsm12-
mediated Ca2+ signaling and facilitate the development of new drugs for this important Ca2+ signaling process."
10898853,"Our long-term objective is to study the organizing principles that establish complex skin architectures
required for optimal skin functions. We have been using developing skin as experimental models because of
their distinct patterns which we use as a readout and their accessibility to experimentation. In the past, we
have taken an analytical approach to study the disruption of tissue patterns by altering expression levels of
different diffusible morphogens. Recent work from us and others have enlightened us that biophysical
processes also play integral roles in tissue patterning, and these roles have been under appreciated. We now
explore the ramifications of this novel understanding. Here we formulate a general hypothesis that tissue
patterning occurs by integrating molecular signaling and biophysical events. Newly expressed molecules on
cells lead to changes in the physical properties of cells and their surrounding matrix, causing disequilibrium
that drives biophysical processes to the next stage. Mechano-chemical coupling leads to new molecular
expression and so on, leading to the building of complex architectures. We will evaluate three key
morphogenetic events. First, the periodic patterning process that converts the skin from one morphogenetic
field to multiple skin appendage units. We suggest there are multi-layered controls. Tissue mechanics may
facilitate Turing patterning and help the propagation of the bud forming wave, while gap junctions may alter the
diffusion of intra-cellular second messengers to modulate the results of Turing patterns. Second, the formation
of stem cell-based skin appendage follicles in each unit. The margin of the feather bud shows planar cell
polarity, Tenascin C, and MMP14-FRET activity that drives bud margin epithelium to invaginate into the
dermis. Fate maps of stem cells and dermal papillae will be generated using singe cell RNA sequencing and
lineage tracing, and the results will be compared with that of hair follicles for key similarities. Third, adaptive
patterning in which adnexal structures such as blood vessels, nerves, dermal muscles, etc. are integrated back
to the skin to form one functional unit. We will use the assembly of the dermal muscle network as a paradigm
to explore these principles. The competence, specification and plasticity of dermal cell fates during this process
will be analyzed epigenetically using a SMA mechanosensor in living explants. By exploring the roles of tissue
mechanics in during tissue patterning of the skin, we can obtain a more holistic understanding of the self-
organizing processes in the development and regeneration of the skin. This knowledge will have significant
applications toward regenerative medicine in the future."

 Penicillins represent one of the most impactful antibiotics in use for the resolution of gram-positive bacterial
infections including bacterial meningitis, diptheria, strep throat, syphilis, gonorrhea, and yaws disease that afflict
more than 6 million people annually. These antibiotics are frequently in short supply and improved production
methods are needed that both increase the accessibility while reducing inefficiency and environmental impacts
associated with current production methods. The primary route to the commercial production of penicillins begins
with batch fermentation of the fungus, P. chrysogenum as a biosynthetic route to 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA),
which is subsequently used as a starting material for the synthesis of b-lactam antibiotics. As an alternative to
currently employed organic synthetic routes to amidation of 6-APA, chemoenzymatic synthetic methods based on
the amidation of 6-APA by penicillin amidases (PAs) or isopenicillanic acid transferases (IATs) provide a competitive
green chemical approach to penicillin-based antibiotics. Each chemoenzymatic approach poses unique challenges.
The amidase-catalyzed acylation of 6-APA requires the use of chemically activated carboxylic acid derivatives as
substrates and proceeds with low transformation efficiency. IATs on the other hand are dependent on phenylacetyl-
Coenzyme A ligases, which have low stability and limited substrate specificity.
 In the present work we target an alternate chemoenzymatic strategy for the synthesis of penicillins from
aldehydes by joining the activities of IAT and an engineered thiol-acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase (TAD). The first
specific aim of this work will target the selective introduction of mutations in the catalytic active site of
phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (NPADH) from Pseudomonas putidia (S12), which has a broad aldehyde
specificity. Mutations will target the transformation of NPADH into a TAD for the synthesis of the N-acetylcysteamine
(SNAc) thioesters. In our second aim, SNAc thiosesters, which are surrogates of acyl-CoA will be introduced with 6-
APA co-substrates in the IAT-catalyzed synthesis of penicillins. This strategy is expected to result in a high product
yield while eliminating the limitations associated with the phenylacetyl CoA ligases. The development this process
will serve as prototypical green-chemistry pathway that can be further expanded into a platform for the production
of existing and new classes of b-lactam antibiotics."

It is hard to overstate the importance of monoclonal antibodies in the life sciences. Antibodies are critical tools in biomedical
research and diagnostics (e.g. western blotting, immunoprecipitation, cytometry, biomarker discovery, and histology), are
one of the most rapidly growing class of therapeutics, and are the basis for myriad new strategies in cancer therapy, such as
checkpoint inhibitors that are revolutionizing treatment. Unfortunately, current methods for the generation of custom
antibodies, including animal immunization and phage display, are slow, costly, inaccessible to most researchers, and often
unsuccessful. We propose Autonomously EvolvinG Yeast-displayed antibodieS (AEGYS), a system for the continuous and
rapid evolution of high-quality antibodies against custom antigens that requires only the simple culturing of yeast cells. We
believe this can be achieved by combining cutting-edge generative machine learning algorithms for antibody library design
with a new technology for in vivo continuous evolution and a yeast antigen-presenting cell that we will engineer. If
successful, AEGYS should have a transformative impact across the whole of biomedicine by turning monoclonal antibody
generation into a rapid, scalable, and accessible process where any lab with standard molecular biology capabilities can
generate custom antibodies on demand simply by “immunizing” a test tube of yeast cells with an antigen. We anticipate
that this democratization of antibody generation will also result in an explosion of crowdsourced antibody sequence data
that will train our machine learning algorithms to design better antibody libraries for AEGYS, starting a virtuous cycle. We
ourselves will use AEGYS to generate a panel of subtype- and conformation-specific nanobodies against biogenic amine
receptors including those that respond to acetylcholine, adrenaline, dopamine, and other neurotransmitters, so that we can
understand their role in neurobiology and addiction.!"

 Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is a chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drug
seeking and use, engaging specific neurocircuits. One of the major projection systems implicated in regulating
behavior motivated by drugs of abuse including opioids is the basolateral amygdala (BLA) pathway to nucleus
accumbens (NAc). However, the BLANAc projection mediates not only approach behavior, as required for
drug seeking, but also avoidance responses. This introduces the question as to the mechanisms by which a
single excitatory projection system mediates diametrically opposite behaviors. Our preliminary data revealed that
morphine (a rewarding opioid agonist) and naloxone (an aversive opioid antagonist) recruit two distinct groups
of neurons – neuronal ensembles or engrams – within the same (BLA) brain area. Moreover, selective activation
of morphine vs. naloxone reactive BLA axon terminals in the NAc induced opposing conditioned place preference
(CPP) and aversion (CPA) respectively. These preliminary data establish a role for two discrete drug-reactive
NAc-projecting BLA ensembles each differentially and selectively sensitive to activation by rewarding (morphine)
vs. aversive (naloxone) events which elicit the acquisition of approach vs. avoidance behavior. Based on these
results, we hypothesize that the expression of CPP and CPA are also mediated by similarly distinct BLANAc
ensembles selectively sensitive to morphine vs. naloxone environmental context. In support of this hypothesis,
additional preliminary findings confirmed that the expression of morphine CPP and naloxone CPA are
accompanied by neuronal activation in both the BLA and NAc. The goal of this proposal is to confirm the function
of the morphine vs. naloxone context-reactive BLANAc ensembles for the expression of CPP/CPA, and to
establish the brain-wide source of activation innervating these two distinct BLANAc ensembles mediating
opposing behaviors. This K01 proposal will, therefore, test the central hypothesis that an environmental context

Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has protected many HIV patients against the development of AIDS. HIV
infection has become a treatable disease. Increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular diseases in long-term
HIV survivors or people living with HIV (PLWH) with no detectable virus load, however, is projected to
become a global health burden. Despite its clinical impact, underlying mechanisms for accelerated
atherogenesis in PLWH remain obscure. Macrophages promote the formation of high-risk plaques prone to
vascular events (e.g., macrophage-rich, large necrotic core, think fibrous cap). Macrophages are
heterogeneous and the imbalance of their subpopulations may accelerate atherogenesis. Evidence
suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs) that contain the HIV-associated protein Nef (Nef EVs) promote
chronic inflammation. We will examine the effects of Nef EVs in the heterogeneity and functions of
macrophages and the formation of atherogenesis.
 Our study represents a dynamic interplay of biology and data science to identify novel mechanisms
and therapeutic targets. We will use a systems approach to test the central hypothesis that Nef EVs
modulate macrophage heterogeneity, shifting the balance toward an atherogenic or less atheroprotective
phenotype. Our preliminary data have led us to the specific biological hypothesis that Nef EVs impair
efferocytosis and contribute to the formation of high-risk atherosclerotic plaques that we will test in three
Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will conduct a systems-based macrophage profiling, involving unbiased
multi-omics, data integration, and network analysis to identify novel mechanisms for macrophage activation
by Nef EVs. Pilot multi-omics data suggested that Nef EVs suppresses efferocytosis. In Specific Aim 2, we
will validate omics data in vitro and in vivo and address underlying mechanisms for impaired macrophage
efferocytosis by Nef EVs."
10904486,"Glioblastoma WHO IV (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with about 8500
cases diagnosed each year in the United States. Within a time frame of roughly one year
almost all patients succumb to this detrimental disease despite treatment. Therefore,
novel, ideally tumor specific approaches are necessary to combat these tumors. Tumor
growth is ultimately determined by nutrients. We have shown before that lactate
accumulates to a significant amount in GBMs and that lactate rescues a broad range of
GBM cells from nutrient deprivation mediated cell death, which is dependent on the
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Through interrogation of genome wide pooled CRISPR
library screens performed in GBM models, we unexpectedly found that OGDH (2-
oxoglutarate dehydrogenase), a key enzyme of the TCA-cycle, is a critical driver gene
for glioblastoma growth. Using a clinically validated OGDH inhibitor (CPI-613) we found
that this drug extended animal survival. We will take these findings further and extend
our research in the underlying mechanisms and will assess the overall hypothesis that
the standard of care is enhanced by loss of function of OGDH, involving appropriate
pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic analyses. The knowledge generated from this
proposal has the potential for high-impact paradigm changing science, knowledge that
will ultimately and hopefully at some point allow us to defeat this detrimental disease."
10906135,"ABSTRACT
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a damaging and pervasive mental disorder that presents a large health and
socioeconomic burden globally. Strong risk factors for AUD include early life challenges that cause inflammation,
such as early life stress and early exposure to alcohol. Microglia, the brain’s resident immune cells, both respond
to inflammatory challenges and organize developing circuits, lending strong support to the theory that immune
signaling changes during development alter circuit maturation to increase later life drinking. Therefore, in my
proposal, I will determine if there is a developmental sensitive window for increased drinking vulnerability
controlled by microglia. My preliminary data suggests that microglia are responsible for increased adult alcohol
consumption through a developmental mechanism: loss of pro-inflammatory signaling specifically in microglia
through the ablation of MyD88, a critical toll-like receptor signaling molecule, increases voluntary adult drinking
in both acute and chronic drinking paradigms. Parvalbumin interneurons (PVIs), late-maturing critical regulators
of coordinated cell activity across the brain, are also altered in frontal cortex of MyD88-deficient mice, an effect
that is exacerbated by early-life inflammation. This PVI change points to a potential mechanism through which
microglia are impacting circuit maturation and behavior. Based on this, my central hypothesis is that MyD88-
deficient microglia improperly regulate the size of the developing PVI population through reduced phagocytosis,
leading to increased inhibitory frontal cortex activity in adulthood that drives excessive drinking. I propose to test
this hypothesis in two aims. In Aim 1, I will determine if MyD88-deficient microglia exhibit reduced phagocytosis
of PVI cells or synapses during development through immunohistochemical techniques. Then I will test the
hypothesis that loss of this function in the frontal cortex during a specific developmental window is sufficient to
induce the altered drinking behavior in adulthood. I will do this by administering a temporary microglial
phagocytosis blocking compound to the frontal cortex during development and then measure adult drinking. In
Aim 2, I will determine whether changes to frontal cortex PVI activity can drive increased adult drinking. Using a
Cre-dependent chemogenetic approach, I will deliver excitatory or inhibitory designer receptors exclusively
activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) to PVIs in the frontal cortex of adult mice, then deliver a designer drug
across the course of an acute drinking paradigm. This will uncover whether increasing or decreasing PVI activity
in the frontal cortex is driving the excessive drinking seen in MyD88-deficient animals. The proposed work will
have an important positive impact not only on our understanding of AUD and its risk factors, but also will answer
basic neurodevelopmental questions about the role of microglia in shaping inhibitory circuits and future behavior.
The outcome of this project will be specific targets, such as microglial inflammatory signaling and PVI function
in the frontal cortex, to manipulate in future studies to progress the prevention and treatment of AUD."

West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, and the leading cause of domestically-acquired arboviral
disease in the United States, resulting in significant disease and death every year among humans and other
animals. Efficacious, vector-targeted interventions are critically needed, but current vector control methods
(primarily insecticides sprayed into the environment) have been inadequate for WNV control. We have been
developing and testing stations that contain endectocide-treated bird feed as a way to control WNV
transmission to humans in the western U.S., the region which suffers from the highest incidence WNV disease
in North America, by targeting the primary bridge vector mosquito, Culex tarsalis. This project is designed to
develop endectocide-treated birdfeed as a novel, safe and scientifically-validated way to control the risk of
West Nile virus transmission to humans in the western U.S. The concept is that birds will self-medicate by
birdfeed stations containing the treated feed, which would be placed as arrays on homeowners' properties, in
neighborhoods or in parks. The blood of treated birds would then kill the primary mosquito vectors of West Nile
virus that blood feed on them, which would lower the risk of West Nile virus transmission to people who live,
work and recreate around the birdfeed stations."
10906144,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a leading public health concern in the US with enormous care costs
and no effective pharmacotherapy despite multiple clinical trials. Multiple studies have shown mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) to be a precursor risk for AD and to be more amenable to intervention. While preclinical studies
have shown that directly modulating activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) using non-invasive brain stimulation
techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), can modulate cognitive function in healthy older
adults, there is little evidence of reliable efficacy in MCI. We posit three reasons for this lack of efficacy. First,
there is no established means of estimating a reliable biomarker as well as a unique dose-response relationship
between TMS intensity and brain activity, which remains a fundamental means of titrating individualized
response to neuromodulation. Second, standard TMS protocols fail to capture the dynamic nature of cognitive
states and the reaction of endogenous brain states to exogenous neuromodulation. By understanding the
dynamic changes associated with a successful brain state, it should be possible to manipulate PFC dynamically
in a manner that enhances cognition. Third, no studies using TMS in AD-related populations have accounted for
the influence of cerebrovascular disease in the response to TMS. We propose to address these shortcomings
by using closed-loop TMS, based on individualized brain networks to establish parameters that can reliably
control brain states during normal memory functioning in healthy aging and MCI.
 To achieve this goal, we will study network activation and neural oscillatory mechanisms underlying the network
that regulates working memory (WM), a cognition function with a reliable PFC-based network characterization.
We will then target this network using closed-loop TMS to the PFC and measure the impact on WM performance
and task-based neural activity. This approach, which builds on our existing K01, U01, and RF1 awards, uses
concurrent TMS-fMRI to identify dose-response relationships in the working memory network, which can be used
to identify neuroplasticity and optimize targeting for TMS (Aim 1). Next, we apply novel closed-loop TMS to
perturb this network using temporally-precise TMS-EEG (Aim 2), optimizing the encoding of memory by
minimizing endogenous alpha oscillations. Lastly, we will integrate information collected via fMRI and EEG into
a single computational framework in order to model spatiotemporal dynamics of the global brain network,
accounting for the influence of both connectivity and cerebrovascular pathology in predicting the success of the
TMS-related response in our MCI cohort (Aim 3). In sum, the project will use cutting-edge brain stimulation and
network modeling techniques to enhance WM in healthy older adults and MCI and will provide a demonstration
of the value of closed-loop, network-guided TMS for future clinical applications."
10906295,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) constitute a selective barrier that regulates nutrient uptake and restricts
antigen access from the lumen to the underlying mucosa. Permeability across the intestinal epithelium is
dynamically regulated by a range of physiologic and pathologic stimuli. Patients with chronic inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), suffer from debilitating gastrointestinal symptoms that significantly impact their quality of life and
pose a disproportionately large economic burden on the healthcare system. Although genetic susceptibility,
environmental factors, and immune dysregulation are all critical contributors to the multifactorial etiology of IBD,
there is increasing evidence suggesting a central role for intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction in IBD patients.
Intestinal barrier properties are regulated through dynamic remodeling and maturation of intercellular junctions
along the lateral membrane of IECs. Tight junctions (TJs) are the most apical intercellular junctional complex
and are composed of a highly organized array of transmembrane proteins and cytoplasmic scaffolding proteins
that anchor the complex to the actin cytoskeleton. The claudin (CLDN) family of TJ transmembrane proteins is
comprised of 27 members in humans that control barrier function by regulating the sealing properties of the TJ.
In the colon, CLDNs are differentially expressed to spatially regulate barrier properties. Notably, CLDN
expression is perturbed in IBD and has been linked to barrier compromise. However, the mechanisms by which
IECs differentially express CLDNs to control barrier function and how CLDN dysregulation contributes to
epithelial barrier compromise in IBD remain unclear. In this proposal we present compelling preliminary data
implicating CLDN23, an understudied non-classical claudin family member, as a central orchestrator of CLDN
complex stability and TJ barrier function in IECs. Moreover, we have observed that CLDN23 expression is
dysregulated in IBD. Thus, my proposed studies will employ novel tools to investigate how CLDN23 controls
intestinal epithelial barrier function using complementary in vitro and in vivo techniques. Successful completion
of the proposed studies will expand our knowledge of basic mechanisms that control intestinal epithelial barrier
function in health and disease, and will open new avenues for investigation of therapeutic interventions to restore
barrier properties and ameliorate inflammation in IBD. Importantly, this scientific proposal and training will
position me for a sustained career as a physician-scientist studying the mechanisms of disease of
gastrointestinal inflammatory illnesses."
10902674,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this proposal is to elucidate biological mechanisms for proton transfer by designing function from
scratch. The coupled movement of protons and electrons is crucial to biological energy transduction and central
to life. While electron transfer (ET) has been extensively studied, less is known about the corresponding proton
transfer (PT) due to lack of easily observable experimental readouts. Computational protein design enables us
to study these phenomena in a ground-up manner where a protein scaffold can be designed from first principles
to mimic biological function in isolated and experimentally tractable ways. This proposal centers on the binding
of abiological photoacid cofactors that would give distinct spectroscopic readouts for PT as a function of distance.
The electron-deficient metal porphyrin photoacid cofactors used in this proposal are characterized by dramatic
acidification upon photoexcitation and distinct spectroscopic changes upon deprotonation. These cofactor
properties combined with our lab’s history of success in the design of porphyrin-binding proteins make them ideal
for use in this proposal. Using computational tools recently developed in the DeGrado lab (vdMs and COMBS),
the cofactor will be positioned within a designer protein scaffold H-bonded to a proton-accepting residue. This
will enable the spectroscopic study of proton on-off rates upon irradiation and subsequent deprotonation of the
cofactor. These ligand-binding proteins will be experimentally characterized through X-ray crystallography and
NMR experiments to validate the proposed structure and binding mode. Ultrafast absorbance spectroscopy
experiments will be carried out by our long-term collaborators in the Therien lab at Duke University. Following
characterization, the proton-accepting residue will be iteratively moved down the protein scaffold with a designed
“water-wire” in its wake to allow spectroscopic observation of the proton movement over varying distances.
Further, a second cofactor binding site will be built to bind a pH-responsive dye. This will allow for end-to-end
monitoring of PT with measurable readouts in a protein system for the first time. This research will significantly
advance our understanding of biological proton dynamics, critically test our ability to design ligand-binding
proteins, push toward the intentional design of water wires, and innovate a new strategy for the design of proteins
that bind multiple interacting cofactors. The use of computational design tools (Rosetta, COMBS, RFdiffusion,
ProteinMPNN, Alphafold), as well as routine protein expression, purification, and characterization will fulfill the
training goals of my postdoctoral tenure, combining my skills in organic synthesis with protein design. Together
these skills will prepare me for an independent research career focused on the design of functional proteins and
enzymes to catalyze new-to-nature reactions."

Cancer survivors require long-term and coordinated care to address the physical, emotional, and psychosocial
effects of cancer and its treatment. Rural cancer survivors are disproportionately affected by chronic illness
and face a higher risk of negative health outcomes. Primary care providers (PCPs) recognize the importance of
delivering evidence-based practice (EBP) cancer survivorship care and are well-positioned to provide
comprehensive and coordinated care, however, the needs of cancer survivors are frequently unmet, and
providersdescribe limitations in knowledge of risk-based surveillance, long-term effects of cancer treatment
and their management, inadequate resources, and growing administrative demands as barriers to improving
survivorship care. The overall goal of this project is to test the effectiveness of pragmatic strategies to promote
high quality, evidence-based guideline concordant care for rural adult cancer survivors in primary care practice
utilizing tools from implementation science to gain a better understanding of the decision making and actions
taken that facilitate or hinder implementation across multiple healthcare systems. To achieve this objective, we
propose a three-arm cluster-randomized, multi-level intervention to provide education, tele-mentoring, and
whether 1) virtual scribes filling the role as trained medical assistants, 2) a team-based approach, 3) or usual
care produces more guideline concordant cancer survivorship care. The primary outcome is practice level
completion and documentation of cancer survivorship care as measured using a previously developed
composite scoring system that compares electronic health record (EHR) documented activity to National
Comprehensive Cancer Network survivorship guidelines. The secondary outcome is to assess intervention
sustainability of arm 1 and 2 activities at 12 and 24-months post implementation; measured as a function of
virtual scribe or team-based care actions to promote prior cancer diagnoses coding (ICD-10), use of EHR tools
and health maintenance order sets and annual ordering of appropriate screenings for cancer survivors. Prior to
implementation, formative evaluations will assess current systems of care and practice-level barriers and
facilitators for the delivery of EBP cancer survivorship care and inform modifications to implementation
Guided by the Normalization Process Theory, we will examine agentic factors (e.g., actions
taken/decisions made by the practice) to modify modes of care management and delivery. The RE-AIM
evaluation framework will be used to explore potential population-level impact and generalizability of the
intervention in real-world clinical settings.

The study will be conducted in 16 rural primary care practices in
Kansas and was intentionally designed to bring care delivery changes into resource-limited practices and

Biomaterials enable the local, controlled delivery of therapeutics like proteins and cells to target tissues
damaged by injury or disease. Customization of these biomaterial-therapeutics systems is essential to
overcome challenges of specific microenvironments and achieve functional regeneration. The heart after
myocardial infarction (MI) is one such injury bed that necessitates localized treatments for re-establishing
microvessels and delivering new cardiomyocytes (CMs). The permanent decline in heart function in patients
post-MI is due to CM death and compromised perfusion, leading to the onset of heart failure in over 3 million
Americans. Persistent ischemia in the myocardium after acute MI limits the recovery and contractility of the
surviving heart muscle, and treatments have yet to replace the lost CMs. Attempts to deliver (a) angiogenic
growth factors to regenerate the vasculature and (b) new CMs derived from human induced pluripotent stem
cells (hiPSCs) to the post-MI heart have suffered from multiple challenges due to a lack of optimized delivery
systems. This project addresses this gap by advancing biomaterial systems for heart regeneration post-MI by
integrating a revascularization strategy for repair and a remuscularization strategy for regeneration. Our long-
term goal is to re-engineer contractility in the heart with a holistic approach to restore myocardium through the
vasculature and replenish CMs using engineered human myocardium (EHM). The overall objective of this
proposal is to demonstrate efficacy of customized biomaterials using an optimized angiogenic protein cocktail
and EHM to alleviate arrhythmia risk and improve contractility. These studies aim to understand how repair and
regeneration ensue by using longitudinal imaging to reveal dynamics of perfusion and contractility as well as
integrated 3D analyses of structure, perfusion, excitation, and contractility. Our central hypothesis is that
increasing perfused microvessel density in the infarct and EHM implant using local delivery of biomaterials for
microvascular regeneration and EHM for remuscularization will promote tissue preservation and maturation of
hiPSC-CMs to reduce arrhythmias and enhance contractility. We will rigorously test this hypothesis in two aims
with implantation of an angiogenic biomaterial film alone or with EHM in a rat model of ischemia/reperfusion
MI. Aim 1 is to evaluate how local controlled release of an angiogenic factor cocktail alters post-MI ventricular
remodeling, perfusion, arrhythmia risk, and contractility. Aim 2 is to elucidate how angiogenic co-therapy
modulates cellular remuscularization with EHM for post-MI regeneration of perfusion, excitation, and
contraction. The parallel aims develop our understanding of how biomaterials and tissue engineering advance
revascularization and remuscularization as effective angiogenic, anti-arrhythmic, and contractile therapies for
the heart. This project uses innovative technologies and analyses to accelerate novel treatments to the clinic
by revealing mechanistic insights into revascularization and remuscularization for heart repair and
regeneration."

 Physical exercise activates a series of molecular events in multiple tissues to meet the demand for
oxygen and substrate. Repetitive exercise causes tissue adaptation and provides broad health benefits. A
fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of exercise at a
systems level is only beginning to be understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium
(MoTrPAC) is an NIH Common Fund initiative created to accelerate the knowledge of exercise biology by
systematically collecting detailed clinical, physiological, and molecular phenotypes in both animal models and in
a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of men and women across the age span. MoTrPAC is a highly integrated
and productive consortium organized into 5 units, each making unique contributions to populating the MoTrPAC
DataHub. MoTrPAc Components include Preclinical Animal Study Sites (PASS), Clinical Centers (CCs), the
Bioinformatics Core (BIC), the Consortium Coordinating Center (CCC) and Chemical Analysis Sites (CAS). This
proposal describes one such CAS, the Georgia Comprehensive Lipidomics Unit for MoTrPAC. Our CAS is
comprised of a team of analytical chemists, lipid biochemists, metabolomicists, systems biologists and
bioinformaticians with expertise in advanced high-throughput chemical analytics and big data, specifically
focusing on exercise-induced alterations of the lipidome.
 CAS studies are divided into 3 categories, Genomics/Epigenomics/Transcriptomics, Proteomics, and
Metabolomics/Lipidomics to produce a draft molecular map of exercise. Through the Biospecimens Committee,
a tissue analysis plan (TAP) for both preclinical rats and human tissues was created and approved by the
MoTrPAC Steering Committee. CAS efforts have led to extensive molecular profiles of 6-month and 18-month-
old male and female F344 rats following both exercise training and an acute exercise bout. These data are being
analyzed by teams of MoTrPAC investigators and initial results have been submitted for publication. CAS has
also produced an initial evaluation of blood, muscle and adipose biopsy samples collected from sedentary
participants and those undergoing chronic endurance and resistance exercise training generated by the CC prior
to pause of recruitment due to the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. To complete the MoTrPAC project, CAS investigators
will continue to carry out studies with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1- to participate in consortium-wide
efforts to analyze and publish expansive multiomics data obtained from multiple tissues collected by PASS
investigators; Aim 2- to collaborate with MoTrPAC to implement temporal targeted and untargeted lipidomics
profiling of blood, muscle and adipose tissue according to the TAP; Aim 3- To perform data analysis and transfer
to the BIC through existing pipelines; Aim 4- to participate in MoTrPAC Committees, Subcommittees, and

Malaria is a major public health problem for many regions of the world, affecting mainly pregnant women and
young children. Plasmodium falciparum infection during pregnancy results in significant fetal compromise and
contributes to hundreds of thousands of infant deaths each year. These outcomes are associated with a
number of malaria-induced placental pathologies, including infiltration of maternal inflammatory cells into the
placenta in response to the infection. This, in turn, is linked to significant damage to the villous placenta,
including necrotic death of syncytiotrophoblast. Complete understanding of the critical cellular and molecular
mechanisms that drive placental damage and dysfunction in placental malaria, however, remains elusive.
Evidence suggests that neutrophils and monocytes accumulate in inflammatory placental malaria, and
neutrophils in particular are also implicated in severe malaria in non-pregnant patients. However, few details of
the roles of these cells in placental malaria pathogenesis are available. Motivated by exciting preliminary data
that show profound lipid peroxidation in placental malaria, we hypothesize that activated innate immune cells,
through oxidative mechanisms, directly contribute to syncytiotrophoblast stress and death in placental malaria,
thereby precipitating poor birth outcomes via placental dysfunction. The objective of this application is to
address this hypothesis using placenta tissue from a malaria endemic population, villous explants and a mouse
model that recapitulates key aspects of placental malaria.
The study objectives will be achieved through three Specific Aims. First, preserved placental tissues from
Kenyan women exposed to malaria will be assessed by spatial transcriptomics to establish the extent to which
trophoblast oxidative stress and necroptosis are coincident in natural infection. Second, the impact of
trophoblast exposure to activated neutrophils and monocytes will be characterized in an in vitro simulation of
placental malaria. Oxidative damage, necroptosis and other cell death mechanisms, and syncytiotrophoblast
destruction will be monitored in villous explants exposed to neutrophils and monocytes undergoing respiratory
burst. Third the role of neutrophil and monocyte oxidative burst, and the relative role of pro-oxidant malarial
hemozoin, in driving placental oxidative stress and damage will be investigated in an outbred mouse model for
placental malaria. Successful completion of this research will expand understanding of the mechanistic basis of
malaria-induced placental damage and fetal compromise, leading to identification of new targets for adjunctive
therapies in malaria during pregnancy. By advancing fundamental knowledge of mediators of
syncytiotrophoblast compromise and death, this work will have implications for other pregnancy conditions
associated with maternal monocyte and neutrophil activity, placental oxidative damage, and cell death-related
placental dysfunction."

The overall goals of this K23 application are to evaluate the relationship between brain structure and function
on cognition and motor performance in myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), and thereby contribute to the
Candidate’s preparation to independently lead future research elucidating the neurobiology of DM2. Although
muscle weakness is the key symptom in DM2, almost 70% of patients report that impaired cognition is among
the most disabling symptoms, and deeply affects their quality of life. DM2, a multifaceted genetic disorder,
results from a CCTG repeat expansion in the cellular nucleic acid binding protein (CNBP) gene, where the
RNA gain-of-function is the main disease mechanism. Although DM2 has several distinctions from myotonic
dystrophy type 1 (DM1), they share some genetic and clinical similarities, e.g. substantial cognitive symptoms
and muscle weakness. While studies of brain imaging in DM1 have increased over the past decade, relatively
little is known about how DM2 affects brain structure and function as brain imaging studies in DM2 are
extremely limited. Results of these studies have had conflicting results because of small sample sizes, lack of
quantitative analyses, and discrepancy between cognitive measures. However, most findings suggest that,
compared to controls, cerebral white matter (WM) is primarily affected in DM2, with reduced in WM volume and
abnormal WM integrity derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Emerging evidence has identified tau mis-
splicing and tangle pathology in DM2, which has prompted interest in elucidating the role of tau in DM2-related
cognitive impairment. This possibility is underscored by recent studies of relationships between WM integrity
and cortical tau deposition and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s
Disease Related Dementias (ADRD). Nevertheless, no study to date has evaluated the role of tau in DM2. In
sum, despite clear cognitive symptoms that suggest CNS involvement, no studies have meticulously evaluated
brain structure and fluid biomarkers of CNS pathology and their relationships to cognitive and motor measures
in DM2. In Aim 1, I will evaluate brain morphometry and DTI measures of white matter integrity, including
fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity between 40 adults with DM2 vs. 40 age-
and sex-matched control. In Aim 2, I will determine relationships of measures of white matter integrity (cerebral
FA and RD) with cognitive and motor endpoints. In Aim 3, I will conduct a pilot proof-of-concept study to
characterize tau profiles in the CSF and plasma of patients with DM2 and associate these findings with
measures of brain structure and cognitive endpoints. The proposed integrated research, mentorship, and
didactic training, combined with the outstanding research environment at Wake Forest University Health
Sciences, will foster my long-term career goals to become an independent investigator with the knowledge and
skills to lead research on the neurobiology of CNS manifestation and ultimately clinical trials that test novel
therapies targeting mechanisms to improve outcomes and quality of life in patients with DM2."

The primary aim of the program is to produce highly-qualified OB/GYN researchers with a specific focus on the
reproductive life cycle spanning the preconception period (including family planning) to developmental biology
to pregnancy care and complications in both women and their offspring. The specific areas of emphasis would
be: (1) contraceptive development, effectiveness, and impact; (2) developmental origins of health and disease
(DOHaD) – fetal programming; (3) reproductive biology including ovarian and uterine function/dysfunction, the
developing embryo and fetus; (4) maternal physiology, pathophysiology, pregnancy care and complications,
and the outcomes of both women and their offspring.
Upon completion of the OHSU WRHR K12 Program, scholars will have expertise in research methods and the
skills required for success as academic physician-scientists in reproductive health. Scholars will develop
content expertise relevant to his or her research interests, along with the specific research skills appropriate to
that research topic as well as skills in scientific writing including grant writing and academic career
development. By the end of the training period, each scholar will be well-prepared to become independently

Dr. Miriam Laufer devotes her career to conducting research focusing on prevention and treatment of infectious
diseases that predominantly impact children in low resource settings and training the next generation of
infectious disease researchers. Her initial K24 award period supported her time dedicated to mentoring both
U.S.-based and international trainees, with outstanding results. Ninety four percent of her trainees continue to
work in academic medicine or research and many of her trainees are now leaders in infectious disease research
and policy. Five of her trainees have received career development awards and three serve as principal
investigators for independent federal grants. With this renewal application, Dr. Laufer will work with institutional
leaders in diversity, equity, and inclusion to enhance her ability to recruit and mentor trainees of diverse
backgrounds. Her career development activities will expand her expertise in vaccinology, with a focus on leading
vaccine trials with public health impact, and the translation of scientific evidence into policy. The proposed new
research will address two areas of Dr. Laufer’s research expertise: (1) Identifying the sources of malaria
transmission and the effect of new interventions on the reservoirs of transmission and (2) Assessing the impact
of infections during pregnancy on infant health and child development. Through her leadership role in the Malawi
International Center of Excellence in Malaria Research, Dr. Laufer and her trainees will evaluate the impact of
RTS,S, the newly recommended malaria vaccine, on malaria transmission. Although the vaccine has good
efficacy in preventing clinical disease, its impact on asymptomatic P. falciparum infection and the prevalence of
gametocytes, the infectious stage of the malaria parasite, has not been well-characterized. With the support of
several NIH grants, Dr. Laufer and her team are enrolling a large cohort of HIV exposed and uninfected infants

investigate both infections in pregnant women and their effect on neonatal, infant, and child outcomes. This K24

diagnosis, prevention, and management of early and advanced cancer by participating in NCORP
trials as a minority/underserved community site, and contributing scientifically and administratively to the
NCORP research bases. This will be accomplished by leveraging the strengths of the Montefiore Health
System (MHS), including Montefiore Medical Center (MMC), which brings strengths in integrated patient
care and innovative health care delivery systems in an academic medical center serving a largely
minority population, and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Cancer Center (Einstein), which
brings strength in training and education, and in baslc, translational, and clinical research through its NCI-
designated cancer center. The MMC-Einstein program also brings critical leadership to the NCORP
Research Bases, including ECOG-ACRIN, Alliance, and NRG, including leadership roles at the level of the
group chair's office, scientific committee chair (or co-chair), and protocol chair (or co-chair). Our plans
build upon our long-standing involvement in all aspects of cancer research as a main member of
ECOG for 45 years and an NCI-designated cancer center for 48 years, and a strong history of minority
accrual to cancer treatment trials (about 65%of all patients). MMC serves the Bronx, an urban community of
1.47 million residents, of whom 89% are minorities and 29% live below the federal poverty level. In the
prior funding period we had a strong track record scientific contributions to the NCORP research bases, and
met our accrual targets with exceptionally strong minority participation. In the next funding period, we will
continue our strong leadership in cancer therapeutics (EA2165), expand the spectrum of our activities to
include new programs in cancer imaging and screening (TMIST), cancer control/prevention (EAZ171), and
cancer care delivery research (CCDR). The MMC-Einstein NCORP program is led by faculty with
experience in cancer therapeutics and biomarker research (J. Sparano, MD), precision medicine and
immunoncology (B. Halmos, MD), and CCDR and cancer prevention/control (B. Rapkin, PhD), and is
supported by a cadre of other investigators with a broad range of expertise, some of whom benefited from NCI-

Mucus dysfunction plays a critical role in airway diseases like chronic bronchitis (CB) and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD affects approximately 29 million people in the US and is the third leading
cause worldwide. The public health and clinical relevance of “mucus dysfunction” are better understood when
one focuses on the clinical manifestations of this process —chronic cough and phlegm and chronic mucus
hypersecretion/CB. Up to 32% of community-living individuals report chronic respiratory symptoms and present
with normal lung function. The presence of chronic symptoms in these individuals is associated with a
substantially increased risk of future hospitalization and mortality.
In this proposal, we will use an objective, reproducible assessment of mucus dysfunction. We will identify and
score mucus plugging on chest computed tomography (CT) scans from community-living individuals
participating in two population-based studies, the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and Coronary Artery Risk
Development in Young Adults (CARDIA). In Aim 1, we will determine the clinical relevance of CT-based mucus
plugging. We will evaluate the associations of mucus plugging with lung function, respiratory symptoms, and
chronic bronchitis (Aim 1a); and examine whether 5-yr. Persistent CT-based mucus plugging is associated with
the decline in FEV1 and future COPD (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, we will examine whether modifiable factors affect CT-
based mucus plugging. We will determine whether air pollution and marijuana smoking are associated with
increased odds of CT-based mucus plugging and define whether cardiorespiratory fitness is related to
decrease mucus plugging. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine genetic resilience/susceptibility to mucus
dysfunction. We will use CT data from the FHS and CARDIA cohorts and genome-wide sequencing data from
the TOPMed initiative to identify common and rare variants associated with CT-based mucus plugging.
This study will increase our understanding of the clinical implications of an imaging-based mucus dysfunction
phenotype at the population level, providing a tangible target for the interception and prevention of chronic
airway disease while identifying susceptibility, risk, and protective factors for this process."

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disease that belongs to a group of Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) and is one of the most common dementias for people under 60.
Our internal circadian clock controls numerous critical biological processes, including sleep-wake cycles.
Circadian and sleep disruptions are prevalent among patients with neurodegenerative diseases, including
FTD. Evidence suggests that neurodegenerative diseases cause circadian/sleep dysfunction, while
circadian/sleep disturbances can accelerate disease progression. However, the molecular and cellular
mechanisms linking neurodegenerative diseases to circadian and sleep disruptions are not well understood.
We propose to perform an unbiased genome-wide screen in Drosophila to identify candidate molecular
pathways underlying the association between FTD and circadian dysfunction. We will focus on the GGGGCC
(G4C2) nucleotide repeat expansion (NRE) in C9orf72 (C9), the most common genetic mutation causing FTD
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, two overlapping diseases on a neurodegenerative spectrum. The C9-NRE
mutation leads to the accumulation of highly toxic arginine-rich dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Preliminary data
show that expressing G4C2 repeats or DPRs in Drosophila leads to circadian period lengthening and reduced
rhythmicity. The circadian deficits occur before clock neuron degeneration, which provides exciting opportunity
to discover C9-interacting molecules acting in the early stages of FTD pathogenesis. In Aim 1, we will conduct
an unbiased genome-wide screen using a collection of deficiencies (deletions that remove multiple genes),
which provides 98.3% coverage of the entire Drosophila genome with only 474 deficiencies. In Aim 2, we will
determine the role of the Toll pathway in the C9 pathologies. We discovered the conserved Toll signaling
pathway as a modifier of C9-linked circadian phenotypes in our preliminary examination of candidate genes.
The Toll pathway has highly conserved roles in innate immunity and is also implicated in circadian regulation.
However, whether the Toll pathway plays a role in C9-linked diseases is unknown. Our study will identify novel
genetic modifiers of C9-related circadian dysfunction and provide new insights into the links between FTD,
circadian rhythms, and innate immunity."

The mammarenavirus Lassa (LASV) is endemic to West Africa where it infects several hundred thousand
individuals yearly resulting in a high number of Lassa fever (LF) cases associated with high morbidity and
mortality. There are no US FDA-approved LASV vaccines and current anti-LASV therapy is limited to an off-label
use of ribavirin that has limited efficacy. LF has been included on the revised list of priority diseases for the WHO
R&D Blueprint, underscoring an urgent need for vaccines to combat LF. Epidemiological studies indicate that a
live-attenuated vaccine (LAV) represents the most feasible approach to control LF. Mammarenaviruses are
enveloped viruses with a bi-segmented negative-strand RNA genome. Each genome segment contains two open
reading frames separated by a non-coding intergenic region (IGR). The large (L) segment encodes the RNA-
directed RNA polymerase, L protein, and the Z matrix protein, whereas the small (S) segment encodes the
surface glycoprotein precursor (GPC) and nucleoprotein (NP). We have documented that recombinant (r) forms
of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and LASV expressing a codon deoptimized (CD) GPC or
containing the IGR of the S segment in both the S and L segments are stable and fully attenuated in mouse and
guinea pig models of LCMV and LASV infections, respectively, but able to provide complete protection, upon a
single administration, against a subsequent lethal challenge with wild-type (WT) LCMV and LASV. Recently, we
have found that a rLCMV containing a CD GPC and the S-IGR in both viral S and L segments (rLCMV/IGR-CD)
is fully attenuated in mice but able to trigger protective immune responses against a lethal challenge with WT
LCMV. Importantly, rLCMV/IGR-CD prevented the generation of LCMV reassortants with increased virulence in
co-infected mice. Following our initial studies with LCMV, we have now rescued rLASV/IGR-CD and the central
goal of this application is to test the hypothesis that rLASV/IGR-CD will have excellent safety and protective
efficacy features as LAV, and unbreachable attenuation. To test our hypothesis, we will carry on a
comprehensive characterization of rLASV/IGR-CD in cultured cells (aim 1), assess rLASV/IGR-CD safety,
immunogenicity, and protective efficacy (aim 2), examine whether rLASV/IGR-CD prevents, in coinfected cells
and animals, the generation of LASV reassortants with increased virulence (aim 3), and evaluate rLASV/IGR-
CD stability during multiple rounds of infection (aim 4). Our studies will provide a comprehensive assessment of
the feasibility of using rLASV/IGR-CD for the development of a LASV LAV candidate able to trigger long-term
protective immunity, upon a single immunization, while exhibiting unique enhanced safety features, including an
unbreachable attenuated phenotype. In addition, rLASV/IGR-CD will provide a valid LASV surrogate that could
be safely used, upon completion of comprehensive experimental safety training, without requiring BSL4
containment, which will accelerate research on this important human and biodefense pathogen."

Drinking remains a significant public health concern on college campuses with the transition into and first
months of college identified by NIAAA as a critical high-risk period. Contrary to popular belief, parents can
play a significant role in mitigating alcohol-related risk during this period by maintaining communication with
their underage emerging adult children and expressing less permissive attitudes toward alcohol use. Trials of
existing Parent-Based Interventions (PBIs) which target parents’ communication and attitudes toward
underage drinking delivered during the summer months prior to entering college have found modest effects on
student drinking outcomes; however, these interventions are less effective when financial incentives are not
provided to parents for participation. One explanation for this is that time and effort required to complete
these programs pre-matriculation may be too demanding. A solution to this problem is to reduce the amount of
effort required from parents’ pre-matriculation and provide them with simpler tasks that could be completed
throughout the first semester, such as sending their student risk-reducing text messages. Findings from our lab
indicate that maintaining communication during the first few weeks of college via text message can help to
prevent increases in alcohol use and consequences throughout the first year of college. Our preliminary pilot
work also suggests that there could be benefits to delivering text messages from parents to students stressing
less permissive attitudes toward drinking on the nights when students are going out, and having parents ask
students to check-in at the end of the night might reduce drinking even more. Given these findings, this
proposal addresses limitations with existing PBIs by developing the first text message PBI (tm-PBI) that will
deliver carefully timed, brief, tailored text messages to parents prompting them to send risk-reducing text
messages to their child that are informed by theory, literature, and parent feedback. In Phase 1, we will design,
develop, and optimize the tm-PBI, Digitally Prompted Parenting (DPP) (AIM 1). DPP includes a web platform
that includes features such as embedded videos and surveys, profile management, and an interactive calendar
module. More important, the platform permits the research team to edit, automate and track the delivery of
tailored text prompts based on information provided by parents on the platform (student sex, parent sex,
race/ethnicity, and parent attitudes toward drinking). Phase 1 will also include focus groups with parents of
first-year students aimed at identifying ways to tailor text message content (N=80). We will the functionality of
the fully operable DPP with a subset of this sample (N=16) to identify and resolve any bugs affecting program
performance. In Phase 2, we will conduct a pilot RCT with 300 parent-student dyads to evaluate shorter- and
longer-term effects of DPP on first-year drinking relative to an active control condition (AIM 2). Finally, we will
assess the acceptability/feasibility of the DPP program (AIM 3) via engagement data within the web platform
and by surveying parents from the DPP condition (N=150), informing further iterations of the DPP program."

SUMMARY
This conference is organized as a response to well-articulated research needs expressed by retired
gold/uranium miners and community leaders in South Africa since May 2021, as well as by UNM HSC COP
and UNM METALS SRP community partners, the Navajo Nation and the Pueblo of Laguna. UNM HSC COP
and UNM METALS SRP community partners consistently strive to learn from and contribute knowledge to
other uranium mining and uranium-waste-exposed communities worldwide. Therefore this conference will unite
in-person African and Native people affected by uranium developments. This conference aligns with
community engagement goals and practices of the UNM METALS Superfund Research Center (SRP) as well
as directly supports NIEHS’s programmatic mission in identifying necessary environmental health research
needs as well as empowering exposed communities to action and healing. We will bring together community
knowledge holders and Tribal and academic researchers to discuss key methods and findings of ongoing
environmental health and risk assessment research conducted in their respective communities. The
conference will also cultivate collaborative community partnerships for future research as well as actions, and
explore new ways of promoting healing, social networking, and environmental justice for marginalized people
exposed to uranium mining. Our hypothesis is that this international conference will create vivid,
multidirectional connections that advance environmental health literacy, stimulate the growth of community-
engaged research opportunities, and promote healing as well as knowledge-to-action framework in historically
marginalized uranium-impacted communities. This R13 conference will have three main Specific Aims testing
our hypothesis. SA1: Organize an in-person conference that brings together innovative, cutting-edge
environmental health sciences with local community experiences, traditional ecological knowledge and
dialogue strengthened by existing, trusted partnerships with the support and involvement of the UNM METALS
SRP environmental and biomedical researchers, storytellers, and traditional healers.
SA2: Carry out scientific and community-driven educational sessions and presentations that support
transnational exchange of experiences related to uranium exposures and social challenges of environmental
remediation and public health actions. In this aim, we will integrate community concerns with scientific
expertise at the intersection of climate change and chemical toxicity.
SA3: Organize in-person, place-based, community-centered visits to each participating Native American
community that support dialogue among diverse conference participants onsite in Diné and Laguna
communities. This aim facilitates community-specific conversations that cultivate collaborative partnerships
and promote the exchange of local knowledge and Indigenous sciences, and support active participation
among Zulu, Diné and Laguna Pueblo partners and in their traditional healing practices."

Inadequate physical activity and poor diet quality contribute to the high overweight/obesity (OW/O) prevalence
in adolescents, aged 12-19 years, indicating a need to intervene at or before age 12. Compared with other
adolescents, underserved (minority; low socioeconomic status) adolescents in urban areas exhibit more
unhealthy behaviors that increase their risk for obesity and related cardiovascular disease (CVD). Guided by
Self-Determination Theory and the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model, the novel 16-week
Guys/Girls Opt for Activities for Life (GOAL) intervention includes 3 components: 1) After-school GOAL Club:
26 120-minute events (2 days/week) for boys and girls that incorporate physical activity and healthy eating and
cooking; 2) Three parent-adolescent dyad meetings to empower dyads about physical activity and healthy
eating and cooking; and 3) GOAL social networking website so parents can motivate each other to help their
adolescents increase physical activity and diet quality. The purpose of this 5-yr group randomized trial (unit of
assignment is school) is to evaluate the effect of GOAL on decreasing CVD risk factors (high % body fat,
OW/O, low CV fitness), improving quality of life (QOL); and increasing motivation, self-efficacy, and social
support to increase MVPA and diet quality among underserved adolescents (5th–7th grade) having BMI z-score
≥0. The long-term goal is to improve the CV health of underserved adolescents to decrease health disparities,
a major priority of NHLBI. Eighteen schools will be randomly assigned to receive either GOAL (n=9) or usual
school offerings control (n=9) condition. Forty dyads of boys (n=20) and girls (n=20) in each school and one
parent per adolescent who is willing to serve as a support person will be enrolled (720 dyads total). Analysis
will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. Aims are to evaluate effect of the GOAL intervention, compared
to control, on: (1) Improving % body fat (primary outcome) by ≥2.5% between intervention and control
adolescents with a BMI z-score ≥0 from baseline (0 months) to 4 months (immediate post-intervention) and to
13 months post-baseline (9-mon. F/U); (2) Increasing secondary proximal outcomes among adolescents:
MVPA (via accelerometers; min/hr) and diet quality (healthy eating index based on 3 24-hr dietary recalls) from
0 to 4 months; (3) Improving secondary distal outcomes: CV fitness (Progressive Aerobic CV Endurance Run,
[15- or 20-m shuttle run]) from 0 to 4 months; and BMI, OW/O percentage, & QOL from 0 to 4 months and to
13 months; and (4) Increasing social support, self-efficacy, and motivation with evaluation of any mediating
effect on adolescent PA and diet quality. An exploratory aim (parents) is to evaluate any effect of GOAL,
compared to control, on: (1) Improving parents’ perceived family nutrition and PA, MVPA (via accelerometers),
and diet quality (fruit-vegetable-fiber screener) from 0 to 4 months; and (2) Reducing parents’ % body fat and
BMI from 0 to 4 months and to 13 months."

Uncontrolled hypertension is the primary risk factor for stroke and hypertensive heart disease, which are the
leading causes of NCD deaths in South Africa, and of disability adjusted-life years lost globally. Clinical trials
have demonstrated sizeable reductions in morbidity and mortality with modest reductions in blood pressure.
Yet, there is a large knowledge-implementation gap between efficacy literature on hypertension control
and effectiveness of health systems to provide hypertension care. This is particularly true in resource-
limited settings, where the constrained public health infrastructure will require innovative scalable and cost-
effective interventions. In South Africa, 25% of the population over 15 years have elevated blood pressure, yet
only 33% of those with hypertension are on treatment. In rural KwaZulu-Natal, we recently found that 16% of
adults > 18 years old have hypertension, and fewer than 25% of them are controlled.
 The scientific goals of this project are to inform best practices for implementation of interventions to
promote hypertension care in rural sub-Saharan Africa. We have undertaken mixed-methods formative work to
identify significant structural barriers to engagement in hypertension care. Qualitative interviews with patients
and healthcare professionals also revealed that lack of patient self-efficacy, structural barriers, and nursing
training deficiencies were additional health systems barriers. Finally, we reviewed best practices for
hypertension care and engaged local stakeholders to propose a package of interventions relevant to the rural
South African setting, and potentially applicable to other low-medium resource settings.
 We will conduct an implementation evaluation of a two-level intervention package: 1) an
enhanced clinic-level intervention, through stepped-wedge cluster randomization, and 2) an individually
randomized home blood pressure monitoring system to promote self-efficacy. We will evaluate the
implementation using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and the Proctor
Implementation outcomes framework, with a focus on Acceptability & Fidelity (Aim 1), Effectiveness (Aim
2) and Cost-effectiveness and Sustainability (Aim 3). To do so, we will leverage a multidisciplinary team of
experts, and an externally-funded hypertension screening and referral program for 30,000 individuals in the
catchment area during 2018-2019.
 This proposal is responsive to multiple priorities stated in PAR-18-007, including 1) implementation of
evidence-based practices within clinical settings, 2) partnership with existing care systems, 3) longitudinal
observation to assess sustainability, and 4) focus on reduction of health disparities. Perhaps most importantly,
due to our partnership with the Department of Health, we are well-poised to advance the implementation
science to elucidate best practices for hypertension care in resource-limited settings, with global implications.

Genetic disorders and congenital malformations, which may be genetic, are the leading cause
of infant mortality in the United States. However, we still do not fully understand which genetic
disorders are responsible for infant deaths and the full scope of their impact. This NIH K23
research proposal represents a multidisciplinary effort to gain further understanding into the
genetic contributions to infant mortality, leveraging the expertise that Dr. Wojcik has already
gained through her dual training in clinical genetics and in neonatal-perinatal medicine and
providing further training in genomic analysis, epidemiology and biostatistics, and clinical
research study design. Building off of Dr. Wojcik's prior research on the implications of genetic
diagnoses in the infant and neonatal period and her experience in exome analysis for novel
disease gene discovery, the objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of Mendelian
genetic disorders within a cohort of deceased infants (Aim 1) and to evaluate the public health
impact of these diagnoses using parental survey data (Aim 2) and data obtained from the
National Center for Health Statistics (Aim 3). Under the mentorship of internationally-recognized
experts in neonatology and genomic medicine (Pankaj Agrawal, MD, MSSc), human genetics
and rare disease gene discovery (Heidi Rehm, PhD), the ethical/legal/social implications of
clinical genetics (Ingrid Holm, MD, MPH) and in collaboration with experts in parental grief after
the loss of an infant (Richard Goldstein, MD), clinical genetics (Wen-Han Tann, MBBS),
perinatal mortality/epidemiology (Dominique Heinke, ScD), with additional research and career
mentoring from successful researchers in human genomics (Alan Beggs, PhD and Robert
Green, MD, MPH), Dr. Wojcik will strive to provide answers to bereaved families. Concurrently,
she will gain the training necessary to build her own career as an independent clinician-
researcher with a focus on the intersection of clinical genetics and neonatology towards a better
understanding of infant mortality and ultimately its prevention."
10906306,"Summary
The therapeutic targeting of cancer cells’ ability to evade immune surveillance has revolutionized the treatment
of many cancers. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) reactivate cancer patients’
(pts’) immune systems to attack tumor cells thus eliciting response even in advanced disease. Unfortunately,
durable response rates remain relatively low (~25%), and it is currently unclear what limits ICI response.
Retrospective analyses of clinical pharmacology data reveal a strong correlation between elevated ICI
clearance (CL) and reduced ICI response that is also associated with cancer cachexia, though independent of
circulating ICI levels or ICI target receptor occupancy. Suppressive immune populations are elevated in pts
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and in multiple animal models of cachexia, but how these immune
populations differ in numbers or function in cachectic vs. non-cachectic pts is poorly understood. The neonatal
Fc receptor, FcRn (FCGRT), is a key mediator of IgG and albumin homeostasis with dual roles in recycling (i.e.
slowing the CL of) both IgG and albumin in immune cells. Project Hypothesis: FcRn modulation in myeloid
populations, triggered by yet unidentified cachexia-associated signaling, leads to elevated CL and poor ICI
response. Preliminary data: 1) murine models replicate increased pembro CL in tumor-bearing cachectic mice
relative to non-cachectic tumor-bearing mice and tumor-free controls; 2) increased CL of other mAbs, including
anti-murine PD-1 mAb RMP1-14 in cachectic mice relative to non-cachectic mice; 3) decreased Fcgrt in liver of
cachectic vs. non-cachectic mice; 4) immunosuppressive immune cell populations are elevated in pts with
NSCLC and correlate with poor ICI responses; 5) increased myeloid and dendritic cell populations in pts and in
mice with cancer-induced cachexia; and 6) paradoxical apparent elevation of FcRn protein in these immune
cell populations in pts and mice. Project Objective: To identify mechanisms linking cachexia, elevated ICI
mAb CL and poor response to ICI therapy. Specific Aims: Aim 1. To identify tissues with elevated mAb CL,
altered FcRn and macrophages in cachectic mice. We expect to identify tissues/organs, immune cell
populations, and FcRn expression/functional differences responsible for elevated CL in cachectic vs. non-
cachectic mice. Aim 2. To determine whether cachexia affects myeloid-derived immune cells leading to poor
ICI efficacy. We expect cachexia will alter myeloid-derived immune populations and FcRn function resulting in
poor ICI mAb anti-tumor responses. Aim 3. To determine how cachexia affects anti-tumor immunity and
pembro CL in NSCLC pts. We expect myeloid immune populations from cachectic pts will display modulated
FcRn expression and function that drives decreased efficacy and elevated CL of anti-PD-1 treatment. Impact:
Despite the remarkable promise of ICI therapies, durable responses remain rare, and causes of resistance
unclear. Our project interrogates probable mechanisms linking poor clinical outcomes to ICI clearance and
cachexia in NSCLC, which may reveal improved strategies for broadly overcoming ICI resistance."
10906313,"Summary
It is well understood how lipids are synthesized and metabolized in cells and that many lipids exhibit signalling functions
to regulate cellular processes in a spatially and temporally defined way. The latter requires the build-up and turnover of
lipid species in membranes either in a site-specific fashion or, alternatively, a directed form of lipid transport. This work
aims to investigate the intracellular transfer of lipids from one membrane to another by several proteins that we
discovered to be involved in lipid transport. In the previous funding period, we synthesized multifunctional lipid
derivatives of five phosphoinositides and four common glycerophospholipids. These feature a photo-activatable
protecting group (”cage”) to release the lipid derivative by light and a photo-crosslinking diazirine to covalently attach
the lipid derivative to binding proteins. An alkyne group for click chemistry is useful for isolating lipid-protein conjugates
or for determining the lipid location in cells by fluorescent tagging and microscopy. In published work, we identified
specific lipid binding proteins for phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate
[PI(3,4)P2], and phosphatidylinositol (PI). Because the “caged” derivatives accumulated in endomembranes, we observed
changes in their subsequent cellular distribution after uncaging with light. All three phosphoinositides transferred to the
plasma membrane (PM) within 30 to 120 sec. Such transport is known for PI but has never been described for PIP3 or
PI(3,4)P2. We then identified putative lipid transport proteins via proteomic analysis and used siRNAs to block lipid
transport. We found two hits that were required for transporting PIP3 and PI(3,4)P2: cytosolic MPP6 and transmembrane
ATP11A. Knockdown of both reduced internalization of EGF receptor, indicating effects on PIP3 signalling. In this work,
we will characterize the lipid transport by these two proteins with respect to lipid specificity (Aim 1.1). For this aim, we
will improve our current method of precisely quantifying lipid transport in cells (Aim 1.2). We will validate our findings
in-vitro by using recombinant proteins including those with point mutations of key residues to study protein-lipid
interactions with biophysical and biochemical methods (Aim 1.3). We will increase rigor by analysing the cellular lipid
composition by mass spectrometry after uncaging lipid derivatives (Aim 1.4). In Aim 2, we will demonstrate the need of
MPP6 mobility for lipid transport. We will develop a light-switchable MPP6 using the LOV2 technique that will replace
endogenous MPP6 (by gene editing) and will be located at the plasma membrane (PM) until we illuminate the cells with
488 nm light. We hypothesize that lipid transport will only be possible if MPP6 is liberated from the PM. We will also test
for lipid retro-transport by MPP6 from the PM to endomembranes. For this, we will synthesize lipid derivatives that
accumulate at the outer leaflet of the PM and induce cell entry and transport via uncaging. In Aim 3, we will synthesize
lipid derivatives featuring the photo-crosslinking diazirine closer to the membrane interphase to reach more transiently
binding proteins such as those with a PH domain. Comparative proteomic analysis of the lipid interactomes will then be
used to identify proteins involved in signalling with and without receptor stimulation."

The sex gap in alcohol consumption is closing rapidly, due to alarming increases in alcohol consumption
among young women. As such, there is an urgent need to determine the factors underlying sex differences in
risk for AUD. Current addiction models propose three neurofunctional domains that drive problematic alcohol
use and therefore serve as candidate sex-specific risk factors: executive function, negative emotionality, and
incentive salience. Data from our lab and others suggest that poor inhibitory control, a key component of
executive function, is a stronger risk factor for women than for men. Moreover, we have preliminary evidence
that female drinkers show less engagement of neural circuitry underlying inhibitory control, and that this sex
difference is influenced by circulating levels of estradiol. However, the degree to which hormonally-moderated
sex differences in executive function extend to the negative emotionality and incentive salience domains, and
how these sex differences influence current and future drinking is unknown. Here we will determine: 1) the
neurobiological factors contributing to sex-specific risk for AUD in each of these three addiction domains and 2)
the degree to which sex differences in each domain influence current and prospective drinking. Female
drinkers will undergo fMRI to assess neural correlates of inhibitory control (i.e., executive function), negative
emotionality, and alcohol cue reactivity (i.e., incentive salience) at three phases of their menstrual cycle: early
follicular phase (low estradiol, low progesterone), late follicular phase (high estradiol, low progesterone), and
mid-luteal phase (moderate estradiol, high progesterone). Male drinkers will undergo three fMRI scans at
matched intervals. Immediately following each scan, participants will complete a session of free-access
intravenous alcohol self-administration. We will then follow participants for 18 months to longitudinally assess
changes in drinking patterns. We hypothesize that hormonally-moderated neural function underlying inhibitory
control and negative emotionality will be stronger predictors of current and future alcohol consumption in
women compared to men, whereas neural alcohol cue reactivity will be a stronger predictor for men. The
project capitalizes on the unique skill sets of the PI (an Early Career Investigator) and a strong, collaborative
investigative team. The innovative design will provide essential information regarding neural factors influencing
development and maintenance of AUD, and, critically, how this risk is influenced by sex and fluctuations in sex
hormones. Ultimately, this proposal is a crucial step in a line of research that will lead to the development of
sex-specific prevention and treatment efforts for AUD."

Liver cancer is the most rapidly increasing cancer in the United States. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the
most common type of primary liver cancer with limited treatment options, accounts for about 75% of all liver
cancer and 30,000 deaths per year. Despite recent FDA approval of several new drugs for the treatment of
advanced liver cancer, five-year survival rate for HCC patients still remains to be around 20 percent, highlighting
the need to develop better therapeutic options. Aberrant expression of Fibroblast Growth Factor 19 (FGF19) has
been recently identified as an oncogenic driver in a subset of HCC patients. FGF19 is an ileum-derived
enterokine that belongs to endocrine Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) family, which normally functions as an
endocrine hormone and signals though FGF receptor (FGFR) pathway in the presence of obligate receptor, β-
Klotho. Overexpression of FGF19 in liver, however, promotes uncontrolled proliferation through FGF19-FGFR4-
β-Klotho pathway in an autocrine-paracrine manner. Our previous studies revealed that β-Klotho recognizes
FGF19 in the same manner as it recognizes FGF21, another member of endocrine FGF family with no mitogenic
properties, and that the molecular interactions between β-Klotho and FGF21 or FGF19 occur at the identical
interface. Based on our mechanistic understanding of cellular signaling by FGF19 and FGF21, we hypothesize
that FGF21 variants with enhanced binding affinities to β-Klotho will be able to effectively compete with FGF19
and consequently inhibit aberrant FGF19 signaling in cancers. The aims of this proposal seek to address this
overall hypothesis by (1) performing in-depth analyses of FGF21 variants using biophysical, biochemical, and
structural studies, (2) testing their capacity to inhibit FGF19 signaling and block proliferation of FGF19-driven
cancers, and (3) examining the abilities of FGF21 variants to overcome/prevent the resistance to kinase inhibitors
currently in clinical trials. The outcome of our studies will provide deeper mechanistic and biological

 The objective of this K01 application is to give Dr. Hofer the necessary training and research experience
to establish himself as an independent investigator focused on using machine learning (ML) on a variety of
healthcare data to predict outcomes during the perioperative period. The career development activities consist
of escalating coursework on machine learning beginning with an online course of ML fundamentals and ending
with a UCLA course on ML applications in healthcare. Augmenting these courses are tutorials on the application
of these techniques to healthcare data and a research program is designed to use ML on healthcare data to
predict perioperative cardio-respiratory instability (CRI) – specifically hypotension and arrhythmia.
 To achieve these goals, Dr. Hofer has established an outstanding team of leaders in machine learning,
perioperative medicine, and clinical informatics. Dr. Maxime Cannesson, his primary mentor, is an expert in
perioperative medicine and the use of ML on physiologic signals. Dr. Eran Halperin, the co-mentor for this pro-
posal, is an expert in ML and its application to genomic and other healthcare data. Dr. Hofer has ongoing collab-
orations with Drs. Cannesson and Halperin on joint projects. Both Drs. Cannesson and Halperin have a strong
track record of mentoring individuals who have progressed to independent and productive academic careers.
Dr. Hofer will be aided by an advisory committee consisting of Dr. Douglas Bell (who will provide guidance on
integrating data from multiple sources), Dr. Mohammed Mahbouba (providing support regarding data security
and creating enterprise level analytic solutions) and Dr. Jeanine Wiener-Kronish (providing guidance on the most
relevant questions in perioperative outcome prediction).
 Challenges managing CRI have been implicated in the more than 15 million annual postoperative com-
plications, costing more than $165 billion, however no scores exist to predict CRI. This study will leverage unique
infrastructure at UCLA where whole EMR data has been combined with physiologic waveforms and genomic
data on more than 30,000 patients. This proposal will use a variety of ML techniques on these data to create
predictive models for CRI.
 In summary, this proposal will provide Dr. Hofer with both technical training in ML and hands on experi-
ence in using ML to predict perioperative outcomes. This study has the potential to create models that will help
clinicians predict, and thus avoid, perioperative instability, thereby improving patient outcomes. Additionally, this
program will provide Dr. Hofer with the tools he needs to successfully compete for a R01 focusing on using ML
models on a variety of healthcare data to predict the downstream effects of CRI – perioperative complications."

People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have a six- to eight-fold higher risk for hip fractures compared to people
without diabetes. Hip fractures are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, loss of independence, and
financial burden. Moreover, hip fracture mortality is higher in patients with diabetes compared to subjects
without diabetes.
Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), the most common test to assess bone health, underestimates fracture risk in
patients with T1D. Altered geometry in young-onset T1D (T1D diagnosis before age 20), and reduced bone
mechanical and material qualities are implicated in bone fragility in T1D. Chronic hyper- and hypoglycemia is
postulated to suppress bone turnover leading to accumulation of microdamage and advanced glycation
endproducts (AGE) resulting in compromised bone material properties in T1D. Despite higher fracture risk, the
effect of T1D on bone structural and material properties and diabetes-related factors affecting bone health are
unknown.
Considering the knowledge gap, we propose to evaluate baseline skeletal phenotype using validated
quantitative computed tomography (QCT), finite element (FE) based bone strength, and OsteoProbe®-
measured in vivo bone material strength index (BMSi), and changes in these measures over 3 years in a large
cohort of adults with and without T1D from the ongoing ‘Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes’
(CACTI) study. We will also determine the role of acute hyper- and hypoglycemia on bone turnover and its
long-term impact on bone material properties.
With improved care, people with T1D are living longer and there is no specific approach for prevention and
treatment of osteoporosis for older adults with T1D. Therefore, this research project will help to characterize
bone phenotype and the effect of long-term hyperglycemia on bone changes over a period of three years; and
therefore, it will allow for future clinical trials to improve bone health and reduce facture risk among adults with
T1D."

Fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are capable of rapid proliferation, robust functionality, and enhanced engraftment when used in a transplant setting. However, the complicated origins and migratory development of fetal HSCs have made their study difficult. It is not known why, and it has recently been debated if, fetal HSCs are superior to adult bone marrow HSCs. In previous studies, we have investigated the role of Notch signaling during fetal development where we have discovered a requirement for Notch1 in the viability and function of HSCs in the fetal liver (FL). We have also recently shown that the Notch ligand Jag1, expressed on hematopoietic cells, is required for function of FL HSCs. In this proposal, we will build on these findings to determine the mechanistic role of Notch signaling during expansion of fetal HSCs and how the fetal liver microenvironment sustains the growth, promotes the maturation and drives the functionality of definitive HSCs. Our preliminary findings indicate that multiple Notch receptors are expressed on FL HSCs and that Notch active cells are robust in engraftment and reconstitution after transplant. In Aim 1 we will leverage our discovery on reporter-based Notch activity to identify a sub-set of FL HSCs with enhanced functional potential. We hypothesize that Notch1 and Notch2 are active in the fetal liver, but that Notch1 activity is required for robust FL HSC activity. We will use in vivo transgenic animal models to conditionally delete Jag1 from specific fetal progenitors, myeloid and megakaryocytic cell types and will test functionality and visualize the FL niche that generates the most robust HSCs. Then, in Aim 2 we will extend our studies to identify novel factors that promote FL HSC expansion. We hypothesize that an antimicrobial family of secreted proteins are novel direct Notch target in FL HSCs, and that these cathelicidin peptides promotes FL HSC expansion. We will test this hypothesis by conditional transgenic deletion of novel target genes in hematopoietic cells and by supplementing the peptides in treatment of fetal, adult, and aged bone marrow HSCs. The knowledge gained from these aims will enhance our understanding of how microenvironmental signaling pathways during embryonic development drive stem cell expansion and function."
10879508,"The increased prevalence of asthma among older adults and its associations with multiple adverse health
outcomes including poor cognition are of significant public health concern. Walking is a robust measure of health
across healthy and disease populations. Mobility impairments are common, debilitating and predictive of poor
health outcomes. Scarce literature suggests that asthma is associated with self-reported and performance-based
mobility limitations among older adults but putative mechanisms that may underlie this relationship have not
been identified. The current proposal aims to address this critical gap in knowledge by examining neurological
(e.g., gray matter volume and thickness, white matter integrity) and behavioral processes (e.g., medication
adherence) involved in the influence of asthma on walking. Specifically, we aim to focus on asthma-related
modifiable factors that are amenable to biobehavioral interventions. The fronto-striatal circuitry, critical for brain
control of locomotion, is disrupted in asthma suggesting its key role in asthma-related mobility impairments. Poor
controller medication adherence and reduced asthma control are proposed as mechanistic targets implicated in
mobility impairments in older persons with asthma (OPWA). We aim to use a validated dual-task walking
paradigm predictive of health outcomes, a burst measurement (i.e., repeated trials) design, and functional-near-
infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to determine the influence of asthma on brain activation levels and trajectories of
walking in 120 OPWA (age 60-80 years) and 120 controls without asthma. We will use multiple MRI methods to
determine disruptions in the fronto-striatal circuitry to identify mechanisms of brain control of walking in OPWA.
Furthermore, we will examine the impact of a 30-day medication adherence protocol and repeated asthma
control assessments (pulmonary function, self-report) on walking performance and its associated brain activation
patterns and learning trajectories. Brain activation patterns and learning trajectories of walking and
improvements in their efficiency due to practice may be novel biomarkers to identify OPWA at risk of developing
mobility impairments as they survive into older age. Such findings, their underlying asthma-specific fronto-striatal
circuitry disruptions, and variability in controller medication adherence and asthma control will inform bio-
behavioral interventions to improve walking, prevent mobility impairments, and improve related health outcomes
among OPWA."
10891394,"Women of African heritage suffer a higher breast cancer mortality compared to their European counterparts.
Though the biologic basis for these disparities remains poorly defined, recent studies suggest definitive roles
for biological variation in the gene expression pathways governing tumor behavior and alterations in the tumor
microenvironment. The transcription factor Kaiso (ZBTB33) is a gene regulatory factor, found in both the
nucleus and cytoplasm of breast cancer cells, that has been functionally linked to racial differences in survival
outcome in several epithelial cancers. In this study we leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to
define functional linkages between Kaiso, autophagy and the immmune tumor microenvironment that
contribute to racial differences in breast cancer survival. We accomplish this through application of machine
learning and artificial intelligence to characterize the Kaiso dependent differences in spatial and topological
features of the tumor microenvironment using multiplex immunofluorescent technologies to profile a unique
breast cancer health disparities cohort (Specific Aim One). We then apply this technology to examine the
impact of Kaiso disruption on autophagy and the immune tumor microenvironment using a murine orthotopic
allograft model for Kaiso depletion in the presence and absence of pharmacologic blockade of autophagy
(Specific Aim Two). We then perform a large-scale application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to
profile the spatial and topological features of the tumor microenvironment in 901 racially diverse breast cancer
specimens by multiplex immunohistochemistry to define the detailed role of Kaiso, autophagy and the tumor
microenvironment in population-specific differences in breast cancer outcome (Specific Aim Three). Together
with a closely integrated multi-disciplinary team of breast cancer pathologists, cancer biologists, computer
scientists, biostatisticians, bioinformaticians and data scientists, we will define new prognostic and predictive
biomarkers that link Kaiso to tumor progression, the immune tumor microenvironment, breast cancer outcome
and how their association differs by race."
10891397,"~37 million (or 15% of US adults) have chronic kidney disease (CKD) and are at profoundly increased
risk of cardiovascular mortality by virtue of having reduced renal function. CKD patients have exaggerated
increases in blood pressure (BP) during physical activity that contributes to increased cardiovascular risk and
poor physical capacity. Our prior work has demonstrated that this augmented pressor response in CKD is due
to exaggerated increases in reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) during exercise that is
mediated by muscle afferent nerve activation, referred to as the exercise pressor reflex. Importantly, such
heightened SNS and pressor responses contribute to increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events,
including sudden death, during physical activity, as well as exercise intolerance that has a profound negative
impact on quality of life. While we now know that exaggerated muscle afferent nerve activation underlies the
exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in CKD, the mechanisms that mediate heightened muscle afferent nerve
activation to induce heightened BP reactivity remain unknown. Elucidating mechanisms of augmented exercise
pressor reflex is critical for revealing new treatment targets to improve cardiovascular risk and physical
functioning in this highly prevalent, high-risk patient population. We have compelling preliminary evidence that
muscle interstitial acidosis plays a major role in activating muscle afferent nerves, leading to an exaggerated
exercise pressor reflex in CKD. During exercise, ischemic metabolites including H+ accumulate in the muscle
interstitium and activate receptors on muscle afferent nerve endings to induce reflex increases in SNS
activation. Bicarbonate (HCO3-) is the major buffer preventing excessive reductions in muscle interstitial pH
during exercise; however, CKD patients have decreased HCO3- bioavailability starting at CKD Stage IIIB due to
an impaired ability of the diseased kidneys to excrete the daily acid load, resulting in decreased buffering
capacity. Our central hypothesis is that muscle interstitial acidosis resulting from decreased muscle buffering
capacity augments the exercise pressor reflex in CKD. We will test this hypothesis using direct
microneurographic recording of SNS activity, hemodynamics, biomarkers and innovative imaging techniques at
rest and during exercise in CKD patients. We will also determine if acute restoration of HCO3- bioavailability
ameliorates exercise-induced hypertension in CKD, and whether oral bicarbonate supplementation enhances
the beneficial effects of exercise training in CKD. Current treatment guidelines recommend bicarbonate therapy
only in CKD patients with overt acidosis ([HCO3-] ≤21 mmol/L); however, bicarbonate may be a simple, safe
and innovative method to target muscle afferent nerve activation and improve exercise hemodynamics and
function in CKD patients even without overt resting acidosis. Thus, these studies have high potential to impact
clinical practice regarding serum [HCO3-] goals, indications for bicarbonate therapy and renal rehabilitation
strategies to improve long-term cardiovascular risk in CKD."

Developing infants are colonized with trillions of bacteria within the intestine. Failure to establish tolerance within
a narrow early life window leads to increased risk of immune mediated diseases in later life, including chronic
inflammation and cancer. Central to the generation of intestinal tolerance is the peripheral conversion of naïve
T cells into regulatory T (pTreg) cells that suppress immune responses to commensal microbes. pTreg cells
arise in the intestine at the time of weaning; however, the cell types that instruct pTreg cell fate are not known,
limiting our ability to modulate pTreg cells for therapeutic benefit. We recently discovered a fascinating population
of antigen presenting cells (APC), enriched within the intestinal lymph nodes during early life. These cells,
dubbed Thetis cells (TCs), express the autoimmune regulator Aire, known for its critical role in immune tolerance.
Here we set forth the tantalizing possibility that TCs represent a dedicated lineage of tolerogenic APCs. We aim
to uncover their role in instructing pTreg cell fate in neonates, and susceptibility to inflammatory disease in later
life. Our proposed genetic models allow lineage-specific manipulation of TCs, including deletion of Aire. Through
these studies we aim to develop a deep mechanistic understanding of TC function. In our efforts to define the
biology of TCs, we seek to understand the ontogeny and development of these cells. Using state-of-the-art
lineage tracing approaches and genetic models that allow us to perturb the intestinal micro-environment in a
tissue- and developmental-stage-specific manner, we will dissect the cross-talk between stromal and immune
cells that drives tissue-specific early life immune development. The overarching goal of this proposal is to
establish a roadmap for intestinal immune tolerance, delineating the critical antigen presenting cells that direct
tolerance to commensal antigens, and the environmental cues that drive their differentiation. These studies will
i) provide an unprecedented view of early life immune development, ii) establish a new framework for peripheral
immune tolerance, and iii) reveal potential therapeutic targets for inflammatory and immune mediated diseases."
10889716,"ABSTRACT
The use of checkpoint inhibitors has altered the treatment landscape in oncology, leading to cures in previously
untreatable diseases. Checkpoint inhibitors block the function of the PD-1 and CTLA4 inhibitory receptors on T
cells to enhance the activation of T cells, particularly tumor-specific lymphocytes. However, non-specific immune
activation has no antigenic specificity and also induces immune-mediated adverse events (irAE) that resemble
spontaneous autoimmunity and involve any and all tissues. IrAEs cause significant morbidity and disruption in
the cancer treatment of oncologic patients and, at times, can be life-threatening. However, the occurrence of
irAEs is also associated with improved tumor regression. This challenge has created a pressing need to
understand the pathogenic mechanism of irAEs to allow for proper therapeutic management and better predictive
algorithms to identify patients that may develop these autoimmune toxicities. However, dissecting the
immunopathology of irAEs is limited by a lack of understanding of the antigenic targets of the autoimmunity. To
address this gap in knowledge, we have established a prospective cohort of patients treated with PD-1 blockade.
Unlike cross-sectional studies, our cohort is unique in its (1) size, (2) prospective nature (before and after PD-1
immunotherapy), and (3) longitudinal design (before and after irAE incidence). We find that almost all subjects
that develop irAEs after PD-1 inhibition have an increased abundance of naïve CD4 T cells at baseline, as well
as more pronounced activation of these naïve T cells following PD1 inhibition. No changes in CD8+ phenotypes
correlate with irAE’s. Secondly, we utilized a whole exome autoantigen screening array to identify multiple non-
tumor related targets unique to each subject’. Together, these data lead to our parallel hypotheses that 1)
immune mechanisms of CD4-dependent autoimmunity are similar between subjects and independent of the
target tissue except when 2) the target of autoimmunity is coexpressed in the tumor and the target tissue. In our
first Aim, we will focus on the phenotype of the CD4+ T cells involved in the development of post-treatment
autoimmune inflammatory arthritis. Single cell multiome assays paired with T cell receptor sequencing will
identify and characterize oligoclonal expansions. In parallel, putative autoantigens identified by autoantibody
screening will be used in activation-induced marker (AIM) assays to validate the presence of autoantigen-specific
CD4+ T cells. We hypothesize that autoantigens are specific to the individual rather than universal; however,
the phenotype of the autoreactive CD4+ T cells will be similar amongst individuals. Secondly, we will examine
the antigen-specificity and CD4+ T cell responses in subjects with lung cancer that develop pneumonitis or a
peripheral irAE. We hypothesize that pneumonitis will reflect preexisting target tissue damage and antigen cross-
reactivity with tumor; whereas other tissues reflect de novo autoimmunity induced by PD-1 blockade. These
experiments will define the biology of irAEs and establish a pathway for the analysis of antigen-specific
autoreactive CD4+ T cells and prediction of AEs."
10899546,"Ebolavirus [EBOV] and Marburgvirus [MARV] are filoviruses that cause severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans and
primates and are listed among the urgently concerning pathogens prioritized in the WHO R&D Blueprint. Genomic
sequences of the EBOV and MARV genera differ by >55%, and within each genera the species sequence diversity
threshold is >23% thus detection by gold standard qPCR-based methods has been encumbered by significant
genetic variability between filoviruses. Clinical diagnosis of EBOV and MARV is difficult as the early stages (i.e., pre-
hemorrhagic) present with non-specific symptoms associated with a range of febrile illnesses that are displayed by
other infectious agents endemic to affected areas e.g., malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic (CCHFV) or Lassa fevers. In order to isolate infected individuals, effective control during an EBOV or
MARV outbreak can only be achieved by implementing rapid and accurate diagnostics with consistently reliable
performance. Aldatu has pioneered the use of PANDAA technology, which enables probe-based qPCR for target
detection in highly variable genomic regions by simultaneously adapting and amplifying diverse templates. PANDAA
uniquely mitigates the presence of genetic polymorphisms to allow otherwise divergent templates to be detected by
fluorescent probes. As such, PANDAA-enabled qPCR is an ideal solution for universal detection of pathogens with
significant strain, lineage, and/or sub-type sequence diversity. Aldatu is uniquely positioned to deliver a rapid pan-
filovirus qPCR-based assay that is rapid, sensitive molecular diagnostic for the detection and differentiation of EBOV
and MARV with superior performance compared to existing diagnostics and won’t be affected by genetic changes
in new viral variants. PANDAA has been successfully applied to subtype-independent detection of more than fifteen
drug resistance mutation (DRM) targets in HIV. Recently, we developed the first pan-lineage assay for Lassa fever
virus (LASV), another WHO priority pathogen with high outbreak potential. We propose to leverage the unique
capabilities of PANDAA to develop a rapid, sensitive molecular diagnostic assay for filovirus detection, and the first
with pan-species coverage of EBOV and MARV, through the following specific aims: (1) development of a pan-
filovirus PANDAA assay, leveraging proven techniques and proprietary PANDAA reagent design; (2) analytical
validation including confirmation of species inclusivity and high specificity; (3) multiplexing of the PANDAA-Filovirus
assay with existing assays for LASV and CCHFV to produce a viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) panel, including the
thermostabilization of the both PANDAA-Filovirus and PANDAA-VHF assays, to meet the requirements of diagnostics
targeted to LMICs; (4) GMP manufacturing of the thermostabilized PANDAA-Filovirus and PANDAA-VHF assays and
(5) assay validation using samples representing a broad variety of circulating species and geographies, with multi-
site evaluations of the test kits at reference labs at CDC- and WHO-affiliated partner institutions. As the first pan-
filovirus assay, we will provide a rapid, standardized testing option for all regions that can be deployed using pre-
existing qPCR equipment in central labs to radically improve the diagnostic workflow and epidemic preparedness."

Increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has opened
the door for targeted therapy in aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and indolent marginal zone
lymphomas (MZLs). Based on distinct gene expression profiles, DLBCLs are classified into B cell receptor
signaling-driven activated B cell-like (ABC) subtypes and epigenetics-driven germinal center B cell-like (GCB)
subtypes but have widely divergent outcomes: ABC-DLBCL is the most chemo-resistant subtype to the frontline
therapy R-CHOP, with 40% of patients experiencing no response or relapse. Co-I Dr. Jean Koff's collaborative
research showed that genetic alterations interact with clinical factors to impact overall survival (OS) in DLBCL.
Our group has systematically examined disparities in lymphoma outcomes and identified African-American (AA)
patients as a poor-risk population in DLBCL, with diagnosis age 10 years younger than other racial groups. In
the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) dataset and other analyses, we found that AA-DLBCL
patients experienced inferior 5-year OS compared to non-Hispanic whites (38% vs 46). Dr. Koff performed the
first-ever characterization of genetic alterations among AA-DLBCL patients and demonstrated distinct mutation
patterns across DLBCL arising in discrete ancestry groups. While some of the most frequent genetic mutations
in AA-DLBCL are related to chromatin and epigenetics, few studies have investigated racial disparities in patients
with aggressive ABC DLBCLs and indolent MZLs. In a large, population-based analysis of patients with indolent
NHL in the US, data presented at American Society for Hematology reported inferior survival in racial and ethnic
minorities over the past two decades, with AAs among the 2nd highest mortality group. The mechanisms that
determine this racial inequality are unknown, but may lie in the particular spectrum of mutations that act in concert
with intricate survival signals imparted by the lymph node tumor microenvironment (Ly-TME). Investigations into
the molecular factors that may contribute to racial disparities in lymphoma have been limited by the under-
representation of AA patients, even in very large lymphoma biorepositories. The long-term goal of this R01 is
to understand the racial disparities in lymphoma outcomes through complex interactions between Ly-TME and
DLBCL and MZL cells in AA patient samples, recapitulate AA-DLBCL and AA-MZL Ly-TME in a tunable hydrogel
platform, and determine the role of Ly-TME on tumor survival, signaling, and response to BCR pathway inhibitors.
The R01 is innovative because it investigates mechanisms underlying racial disparity AA-Ly-TME and develops
AA-DLBCL organoids. The proposed work is significant because it will examine how AA-Ly-TME differs from
that of white patients and determine its impact on BCR signaling and BTKi."

The Orang Asli are indigenous people of Peninsular Malaysia, still leading semi-nomadic lifestyles, with a
high prevalence of the skin disease tinea imbricata which is caused by Trichophyton concentricum fungal
infections. The relationship between skin fungal infections and the skin microbiome is poorly understood,
particularly in these indigenous populations that represent underserved communities. Investigating this
relationship in the Orang Asli has the potential to uncover novel interactions between hosts and microbes,
elucidate infection mechanisms, and identify therapeutic interventions, as well as contribute towards global
databases of the skin microbiome. Understanding this unique fungal pathogen and the disease that it
causes may reveal novel host-fungal interactions that have broader implications to our understanding of
skin epithelial cell biology, fungal immune responses, and fungal metabolic pathways that affect their host.
Our preliminary epidemiologic study on 361 Orang Asli participants characterized the village-specific
prevalence of tinea imbricata and enabled the collection of skin samples for Trichophyton culturing and
microbiome analyses. Our preliminary metagenomic sequencing data on the skin microbiome
demonstrated the presence of known commensal bacteria, such as Staphylococcus, Cutibacterium, and
Corynebacterium, providing confidence in our workflow. Additionally, more than half of the microbial taxa in
the Orang Asli samples are uncharacterized, indicating the probable elucidation of novel microbes capable
of colonizing human skin. Therefore, we aim to conduct (in Aim 1) a larger-scale study to determine the
epidemiology of tinea imbricata in a study encompassing multiple villages of the Orang Asli community with
diverse lifestyles and infrastructure. We hypothesize that T. concentricum infection is associated with
specific skin microbiome features, and that the skin microbiome of the Orang Asli will be highly distinct from
analyses conducted in developed urban societies. By utilizing skin microbiome sequencing (in Aim 2) and
fungal isolate whole-genome sequencing (WGS) approaches (in Aim 3), we will examine the interactions
between the skin microbiome and fungal infections, as well as to model tinea imbricata disease
progression. This study is built upon collaborations between the PI, Dr. Yvonne Lim (Universiti Malaya) with
NIH intramural investigators, Dr. P’ng Loke (NIH/NIAID), Dr. Julie Segre (NIH/NHGRI), and Dr. Heidi Kong
(NIH/NIAMS), with expertise in the host-microbe interactions, skin microbiome, fungal transmission, and
field studies."

 Relapse following treatment for substance use disorder (SUD) remains the norm, not the exception.
Mindfulness treatment is a particularly efficacious outpatient aftercare approach for reducing relapse among
individuals stepping down from more intensive SUD treatment (e.g., residential or intensive outpatient).
Unfortunately, aftercare mindfulness treatment is inaccessible to most patients, due to limited clinician training
opportunities and a lack of effective implementation strategies. For example, to date there are no existing
technology-based (e.g., web-based) aftercare mindfulness treatments for preventing relapse to substance use.
Research is also lacking on mechanisms of change in mindfulness treatment for SUD (i.e., how and why this
treatment works). Ecological momentary assessment (EMA), or intensive longitudinal measurement via
smartphone, captures dynamic, high-resolution data in near real-time. Mindfulness, negative/positive affect,
stress, and craving - which are momentary states that change over the course of a day - are central to putative
mechanisms of mindfulness treatment for SUD. Mindfulness treatment for SUD is theorized to weaken or
“decouple” the momentary associations of negative affect with craving, stress with craving, and (low) positive
affect with craving. However, no studies to date have used EMA to evaluate these putative momentary
decoupling mechanisms following mindfulness treatment for SUD.
 The proposed K23 career development award provides training to support Dr. Corey Roos in becoming
an independent patient-oriented researcher focused on technology-based addiction treatment and
mechanisms of change in addiction recovery. The training goals of this award focus on technology-based
treatment development, rigorous clinical trial research, EMA, and mechanisms of mindfulness. Dr. Roos will
receive training in these goals through direct mentorship from experts, coursework, conferences, and hands-on
research activities.
 The proposed research project of this K23 application involves developing and evaluating UrgeSurfer,
the first web-based mindfulness treatment for preventing relapse substance use among individuals with SUDs.
The web program will be iteratively developed through a user-centered design framework involving client
feedback and usability testing. We will then conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate UrgeSurfer
as an adjunctive outpatient aftercare treatment for preventing relapse. Moreover, as part of this trial, will
investigate putative decoupling mechanisms of change using EMA. This K23 award will propel Dr. Roos into a
successful career as an independent patient-oriented addiction treatment researcher."

Abstract
The microscopic examination of stained tissue is a fundamental component of biomedical research and for the
understanding of biological processes of disease which leads to improved diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic
response prediction. Ranging from cancer diagnosis to heart rejection and forensics the subjective interpretation
of histopathology sections forms the basis of clinical decision making and research outcomes. However, it has
been shown that such subjective interpretation of pathology slides suffers from large interobserver and
intraobserver variability. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning has enabled the objective and
automated analysis of images. These methods have been applied with success to histology images which have
demonstrated potential for development of objective image interpretation paradigms. However, significant
algorithmic challenges remain to be addressed before such objective analysis of histology images can be used
by clinicians and researchers. Leveraging extensive experience in developing and decimating research software
based on deep learning the PI will pioneer novel algorithmic approaches to address these challenges including
but not limited to: (1) training data-efficient and interpretable deep learning models with gigapixel size microscopy
images for classification and segmentation using weakly supervised labels (2) fundamental redesign of data
fusion paradigms for integrating information from microscopy images and molecular profiles (from multi-omics
data) for improved diagnostic and prognostic determinations (3) developing visualization and interpretation
software for researchers and clinical workflows to improve clinical and research validation and reproducability.
The system will be designed in a modular, user-friendly manner and will be open-source, available through
GitHub as universal plug-and-play modules ready to be adapted to various clinical and research applications.
We will also develop a web resource with pretrained models for various organs, disease states and subtypes
these will be accompanied with detailed manuals so researchers can apply deep learning to their specific
research problems. Overall, the laboratory’s research will yield high impact discoveries from pathology image
analysis, and its software will enable many other NIH funded laboratories to do the same, across various
biomedical disciplines."
10900635,"The potential outcomes of this application include: (1) Curriculum development and the creation of internship opportunities within an entrepreneurship in biotechnology focused program; (2) a greater representation of diverse researchers within biotech entrepreneurship in Southeast Louisiana with the potential to expand across the U.S.; (3) a tangible number of students from diverse backgrounds who can go on to pursue advance degrees and employment opportunities within the biotechnology sector; and (4) a pipeline of individuals who will value the importance of the responsible conduct of research, and apply those ethics to create their own companies as entrepreneurs, or their own training programs as educators or researchers within various biotechnology fields. This Small Business Innovation Research application addresses an identified challenge and unmet gap in curriculum development that combines exposure to fundamental concepts in both biotechnology research and entrepreneurial development and provides a pathway to create opportunities for a more diverse workforce. Unlike existing curricula, the proposed programming does not have the goal of promoting careers exclusively in academia or biotechnology. The intention is to leverage the diverse background and training of professionals at Obatala Sciences, Delgado Community College, Xavier University of Louisiana, and the University of New Orleans, to give students greater insight into the opportunities that exist and the relevance of maintaining the responsible conduct of research within all stages of their career. Such a program is a complement to any set of traditional business and/or research courses and provides a mechanism to reinforce some of the necessary elements of success within research in biotechnology and entrepreneurship. Obatala anticipates achievement of the following outcomes: Firstly, it will implement coursework and accompanying teaching tools that focus on entrepreneurship in biotechnology and are adaptable across multiple teaching platforms and programs that are designed to give greater exposure to opportunities in entrepreneurship. Secondly, it will create a pipeline of interns and professionals who can apply lessons learned from their executive MBA or entrepreneurship programs to multiple facets of their careers and take these fundamentals with them to other opportunities throughout the nation. Thirdly, it will create a success metric that can be applied to programs that are designed to promote diversity in research and entrepreneurship. By incorporating one or all of these innovations to the current approach to teaching biotechnology, Obatala will introduce an adaptable teaching model with impacts spanning academic and industry researchers and entrepreneurs, across fields including therapeutics and regenerative medicine. Obatala will position itself as a leader that not only promotes diversity in research, but also in training the next generation of researchers and promoting the highest standards of ethics and the responsible conduct of research. Such activity has potential to positively impact the current perception of the role of entrepreneurship in research in a global scale."
10902049,"The development and validation of biomarkers for the early detection of cancer requires a team
of investigators and resources to move from discovery through stages of validation to the ultimate
goal of a clinically approved and useful test. This Biomarker Characterization Center proposes
to develop and validate blood-based cancer specific DNA methylation biomarkers by bringing
together investigative teams from three NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers (The
UMPC Hillman Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Pittsburgh, The Sidney Kimmel
Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, and The University of Maryland Marlene &
Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center) to accomplish this complex task. To
coordinate and support these efforts, an administrative core will integrate activities of EDRN BCC
investigators. The administrative core of this Biomarker Characterization Center oversees,
coordinates and supports the activities of this multidisciplinary program. Through overseeing and
supporting these activities, the individual components of the Biomarker Development Laboratory
and the Biomarker Reference Laboratory are able to effectively accomplish their objectives and
integrate their activities with other components of the BCC (BDL and BRL), with other NCI
programs and with other EDRN centers (BCCs, CVCs and the DMCC)."
10902050,"As part of a Biomarker Characterization Center, the Biomarker Development Laboratory
will develop improved methods to detect DNA methylation changes for the early detection
of lung cancer. Led by Dr. James Herman and Dr. Tza-Huei Jeff Wang, a multidisciplinary
team of investigators will develop improved panels of DNA methylation alterations able to
detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) changes in plasma, to determine the origin of
ctDNA from lung cancer or other common malignancies, and to continue improvements
in methylation detection methods to better detect the small amounts of ctDNA present in
plasma. This EDRN Biomarker Development Laboratory will use high quality,
prospectively collected biospecimens to develop highly sensitive, specific and
quantitative approaches for the detection of tumor-specific DNA methylation
abnormalities in plasma. These methods will be transferred to the Biomarker Reference
Laboratory to be standardized and tested for performance in a CLIA setting."

10870653,"Project Summary
 Brucella spp. are bacteria that naturally infect a variety of domesticated and wild animals leading to
abortions and sterility, and these bacteria are also capable of causing debilitating human infections, which
often result from human exposure to infected animals and animal products. Brucella spp. are considered
threats as potential biological weapons. Importantly, antibiotic treatment against brucellosis is prone to disease
relapse, and there is currently no safe and effective vaccine to protect humans against infection with Brucella.
The brucellae are intracellular pathogens that reside within immune cells called macrophages where they
replicate in a specialized compartment, and the capacity of Brucella to survive and replicate within
macrophages is essential to their ability to cause disease. Over the last few years, our laboratory has
characterized genetic pathways that are critical for the intracellular survival and pathogenesis of Brucella
strains, and specifically, we have identified small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) that are essential for Brucella
virulence.
 Preliminary experiments have revealed the presence of more than 20 novel sRNAs in B. abortus, and we
have identified one of these sRNAs, called Bsr7 (for Brucella small RNA) that is required for the ability of the
bacteria to withstand outer membrane stress. Given the strong connection between Bsr7 and the integrity of
the cellular envelope, we hypothesize that deletion of Bsr7 will lead to significant attenuation of B. abortus in
both macrophage and animal models of infection. Additionally, we hypothesize that Bsr7 is produced under
biologically relevant conditions, such as acidic pH, oxidative stress, nutrient limitation, and/or diminished
oxygen. Moreover, it is hypothesized that Bsr7 regulates the expression of genes important for the infectivity of
B. abortus. Therefore, we plan to characterize the biological and regulatory functions of Bsr7, and in the end,
the information gleaned from these studies may be used to develop new therapeutic and vaccine strategies
against human Brucella infection."
10866545,"PROJECT SUMMARY
It is estimated that by 2050, Latino/a/x will compose over half of the California population, highlighting the
critical priority for understanding cardiometabolic health risk in this population. Latinx have a 50% lifetime risk
of developing type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases, a result of a complex mixture of predisposition,
health behaviors, and environmental factors. A common physiological mechanism associated to chronic
diseases is a failure to maintain homeostasis during times of persistent stress. While ample evidence supports
a role of psychosocial stressors on allostatic load, several important challenges have not been yet addressed
in Latinx youth, such as the role of racial/ethnic discrimination; therefore there is an urgent need to examine
the impact of racial discrimination along with wide-ranging profiles of psychosocial and environmental
stressors, in-depth phenotyping of allostatic load, and pertinent biomarkers to identify subsets of high
cardiometabolic disease risk individuals. The overarching aim of this proposal is to characterize allostatic load
(the result of cumulative stressors on physiology via alterations in brain or nervous system physiology)
associated with socio-environmental stressors focused on perceived and imposed (environmental) racial
discrimination in Latinx youth. We will leverage a body of literature specific to Los Angeles area Latinx youth to
develop an evidence-based allostatic load index and to determine the role of racism, alongside other salient
predictors of allostatic load. To test our aims, we will collect two separate waves of data (2-years apart) from
the same subjects, Latinx or White, late adolescents/young adults. Data collection will consist of serum and
saliva biospecimens for determination of allostatic load indices. A comprehensive panel of 20 allostatic load
makers will be utilized representing neuroendocrine, cardiovascular and metabolic components, markers that
were specifically selected based on existing literature on allostatic load and knowledge on pathophysiology
associated with type 2 diabetes risk in Latinx youth. Additional measures include a cumulative measure of
environmental burden (as determined by CalEnviroScreen 4.0), and comprehensive measures of
discrimination, psychosocial stress, and health history and behaviors (family history of type 2 diabetes, diet,
physical activity, smoking, and sleep). To our knowledge, this will be the first longitudinal study in Latinx vs.
White youth specifically designed to characterize allostatic load profiles and to examine the role of racial/ethnic
discrimination."

10866548,"PROGRAM SUMMARY
The purpose of this new T35 short-term training proposal is to provide veterinary students with an opportunity
to perform mentored research over the summer months within the context of a structured educational
framework, thereby introducing them to career options based in biomedical science. To accomplish this, we
have created an integrated program across Tufts University Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine
(TUCSVM) and the Division of Comparative Medicine at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (DCM-MIT)
that permits broad exposure to research involving infectious disease, microbiome, comparative oncology,
cardiovascular disease, toxicology, drug and device development, among others. This new program builds
on the combined experiences of the mPIs (Drs. Cheryl London and Kelly Metcalf Pate) and leverages a lengthy
history of actively engaging DVM students to participate in a variety of research endeavors at both institutions.
First- and second-year veterinary students will be recruited from TUCSVM as well as from the larger landscape
of veterinary schools across the US and Canada to work with 30 mentors representing a wide array of
biomedical research. In addition to standard activities covering responsible conduct of research, formulating
a hypothesis/experimental plan, ensuring rigor and reproducibility of data, and critical review of the literature,
students will have organized field trips to visit unique facilities at the host institutions including the New England
Regional Biocontainment Laboratory, the Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute, local industry
partners (Pfizer, Sanofi, Takeda), and contract research organization (Charles River, Jackson Laboratories,
CBSET). They will also participate in the weekly Summer Research Seminar Series featuring veterinarians
actively engaged in biomedical research across academic centers and the biotechnology sector. All students
will participate in the annual National Veterinary Scholars Symposium to ensure wide scientific exposure and
provide an opportunity for networking. Trainees are also expected to complete a final written report
summarizing their findings and contribute to associated manuscript preparation and editing with their mentors.
Programmatic impact will be assessed through a detailed questionnaire administered before and after
completion of the program, with the goal of engaging in yearly process improvement to enhance student
experience. Longitudinal tracking of students through completion of the DVM program and for another 10
years thereafter will provide a formal mechanism to determine retention within the biomedical work force.
Yearly formal assessments by the External Advisory Council will facilitate objective evaluation of milestones
and input regarding programmatic structure. Given that this is a new collaborative endeavor, 8 students will
be accepted for the first 3 years, with expansion to 10 students in the remaining two years as the program is
optimized. Importantly, this collaborative effort will inspire DVM students to consider a career in
science through productive, positive immersive experiences led by successful and engaging mentors."
10867340,"Just as geriatric care is complex, with better outcomes associated with collaboration among practitioners of
differing specialties, research is likely to be more impactful when performed collaboratively. Furthermore,
diversity in research collaboration can increase research quality, however diversity among the geriatrics
scientific workforce has not kept pace with a rapidly diversifying population. In spite of a proliferation of
consortia, fostering diverse interprofessional collaboration (IPC) networks remains a significant barrier for
providers and researchers alike. While strategies to enhance IPC in care have been investigated, IPC in aging
research, and specifically in consortia, has not been explored. The objective of this study is to investigate how
to maximize the impact of consortia on aging research value by identifying barriers to engagement in IPC,
assessing the effect of consortium membership on diversity in collaborative networks, and determining factors
contributing to effective and productive collaborations. There is limited information regarding how participation
in a consortium influences development of collaborative behaviors, factors that contribute to successful
connections, or how to overcome in-group favoritism to bring together more diverse collaborators. To achieve
increased diversity and IPC in aging research we need a greater understanding of what factors represent
barriers to IPC in the research community and how to increase connection of diverse researchers within
consortia. I propose using three consortia as a “laboratory” to collect formative data necessary to understand
individual and environmental factors that contribute to collaborative research behaviors. I will perform a mixed-
methods study using a combination of longitudinal surveys, interviews, and social network analysis (SNA) to
assess the impact of diversity in IPC on research productivity, measure how researcher collaborative networks
are developed over time, and develop an intervention to increase the connection between diverse collaborators
in aging consortia. I specifically aim to: (1) Determine the characteristics of social network connections that
affect aging research productivity as measured by publication and funding metrics; (2) Examine how individual
and environmental characteristics including perceived barriers to IPC research influence the creation and
productivity of network ties; and (3) Develop a multilevel intervention using an algorithm to connect diverse
research collaborators within consortia.
This proposal will provide greater understanding of community needs and produce actionable insights to
diversify and strengthen collaborations produced. By providing experience in aging research, SNA, intervention
development, and organizational behavior, the research plan is highly complementary to the career
development of an independent aging researcher focused on developing interventions to promote IPC and
improve the quality of aging research and care. The team of mentors is highly qualified and multidisciplinary,
spanning domains of aging, organizational behavior, and relevant scientific methods."
10867350,"One of the principal obstacles to curing HIV is the existence of viral reservoirs in distinct compartments and
cell types that are unaffected by antiretroviral therapy (ART). In the central nervous system (CNS), these
reservoirs are comprised of myeloid cells, such as perivascular macrophages and microglia. Critically, these
reservoirs are generally established prior to the initiation of ART and the presence of ART in the CNS does not
affect the established reservoir in long-lived myeloid populations. Thus, even in individuals on suppressive ART,
persistently infected CNS macrophages and microglia can drive ongoing neuroinflammation and provide a
source of HIV for viral recrudescence during medication hiatus or failure. Our ability to eliminate these reservoirs
is severely limited by the lack of understanding of the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of HIV in myeloid
cells. To effectively target and eliminate CNS reservoirs in people living with HIV (PLWH), it is critical to define
the transcriptional mechanisms mediating persistent infection in distinct CNS myeloid populations.
 The impact of HIV infection in the CNS is heightened in PLWH who have substance use disorders, including
those who take and/or misuse therapeutic drugs such as benzodiazepines (BDZ). Benzodiazepines are used by
more than 30 million Americans, have high abuse liability and misuse of these drugs accounts for 15 – 20% of
their use. Benzodiazepines are prescribed to a growing number of PLWH and are associated with an increased
risk of neurocognitive symptoms in this population. Little is known about the mechanisms by which BDZ impact
HIV neuropathogenesis. Our published and preliminary data indicate that BDZ can alter the transcriptional
regulation of HIV infection. To better understand and treat the development of neuroHIV in PLWH who use and/or
misuse BDZ, it is vital to determine who benzodiazepines affect the transcriptional programs in myeloid cells.
 We hypothesize that both macrophages and microglia enter a semi-quiescent transcriptional state
during ART exposure and that benzodiazepines disrupt this state and increase transcriptional activity
and viral replication. Our data show that the BDZ Xanax, as well as some latency reactivation agents, mediate
a dose-dependent increase in p24 production in infected, ART-treated cells. Our preliminary studies suggest
these effects may result from BDZ interactions with the epigenetic regulator RUNX1. We posit that these changes
in HIV replication in myeloid cells reflect the epigenetic state of the provirus. Thus, the growing population of
PLWH who use BDZ is at greater risk of more severe neuropathogenesis. It also suggests that BDZ may provide
the basis for novel therapeutics to manipulate HIV transcription in myeloid cells. Therefore, we will evaluate the
transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms sustaining the semi-quiescent state of HIV transcription in ART-
treated human macrophages (Aim 1), define the differences in transcriptional and epigenetic processes in
different types of myeloid cells using human syngeneic iPSC-derived macrophages and microglia (Aim 2), and
examine the effect of benzodiazepines on transcription HIV-infected, ART-treated myeloid cells (Aim 3)."
10867351,"ABSTRACT
Less than 2% of the human genome sequences are protein-coding genes. It has been shown that at least
80% of the non-coding sequences of human genome are associated with certain chromatin biochemical
modifications, and more than 70% of the genomic DNA can be transcribed into RNAs at various stages
during development. Accumulating evidence suggests that these non-coding regulatory sequences are
critical for spatial and temporal gene expression control. However, it remains challenging to determine
whether and how these non-coding regulatory DNA and RNA sequences play a causal in a variety biological
processes including diseases. In particular, questions of how the activity of enhancers are precisely
controlled, and how non-coding RNAs recruit effector proteins to control gene expression and genome
function, are largely unexplored. My overall hypothesis is that, cells integrate effector proteins and regulatory
non-coding DNA and RNA sequences to create a spectrum of functionalities for precise gene regulation
control. The rules governing these functionalities can then be derived by defining the key components, and
examining how each functions alone and in combination. To test this, we have developed a robust,
innovative multi-omics approaches allowing for comprehensive analysis of the molecular composition
associated with non-coding DNA and RNA sequences. My long-term goal is to develop a predictive and
functional understanding of the non-coding genome, which will elucidate how these regions can be
specifically targeted for genomic medicine. Toward this goal, we seek to achieve three major goals: 1)
Control enhancer activity through systematic and targeted recruitment of epigenetic effectors; 2) Define the
regulome of lncRNA-mediated gene regulation; 3). Develop innovative mouse model to study the function
and regulation of non-coding genome disease model in vivo. Our work will have a broad impact to advance
genomics research and genomics medicine by developing new approaches and new mouse models to
deepen our knowledge on non-coding regulatory genome."
10868311,"PROJECT SUMMARY – DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICS CORE
The Data Management and Statistics Core (DMSC), which includes a Data Management Program (DMP) and a
Statistics Program (SP), will provide comprehensive, integrated, and continually updated data management for
the acquisition, organization, use, and sharing of data from research participants in the New Mexico (NM) ADRC.
The DSMC will ensure timely and fully compliant transmission of ADRC UDS4 data, Brain Donor information,
brain images, and other data to NACC and SCAN, and work with NCRAD to provide coordinated blood sample
and DNA sample sharing reports. The DMSC, comprised of a Data Management Program (DMP) and a Statistics
Program (SP) will be fully integrated with NM ADRC leaders, Cores, REC, and other ADRCs. The DMP will
ensure: 1) accuracy, completeness and timely submission of fully compliant data and images from the ADRC
and its Affiliated Programs; 2) user-friendly access to, and appropriate use of, anonymized data and available
biological samples for researchers inside and outside of NM; 3) development and provision of relevant reports
for the ADRC’s Cores and REC including monitoring and optimizing their performance; and 4) act as a catalyst
for new collaborations. The SP has assembled a highly coordinated, close-working expert team to address the
analytical, statistical, and career development needs of researchers, trainees, and collaborators from a wide
range of disciplines, ADRC organizations, and other programs. The SP will: 1) contribute to research design,
statistical methods, size, and statistical power of their studies, analyze data, interpret findings, contribute to the
preparation of grants, abstracts, and manuscripts, and develop their analytical skills; 2) provide information and
assistance with available ADRC and Affiliated Program data and samples and support the productive use of data
and/or samples from National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC), National Centralized Repository for
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD), and other research programs and publicly available
data. The SP will continue to develop, implement, test and support the proper use of new computational,
mathematical, statistical, big-data, machine-learning, data-mining, data-harmonization, and image-analysis
tools, and new approaches to the use of clinical, imaging, and fluid-based biomarker data. The DMSC will
integrate seamlessly within the NM ADRC to advance the overarching theme of understanding vascular and
inflammatory contributions to Alzheimer's and cerebrovascular diseases in underrepresented groups in New
Mexico."
10868313,"PROJECT SUMMARY– NEUROPATHOLOGY CORE (NP)
The primary goal of the Neuropathology Core is to collect post-mortem specimens from well-characterized
participants (after receiving their consent), diagnose pathologic changes in their brains as precisely as possible,
and share material and data freely. By accomplishing this goal, the Neuropathology Core aligns with the overall
theme of the NM ADRC on understanding vascular and inflammatory contributions to Alzheimer's and
cerebrovascular diseases in underrepresented groups in New Mexico. The core is led by two neuropathologists
with complementary expertise (Elaine L. Bearer, MD-PhD, and Karen SantaCruz, MD). The participants are both
younger and older people who have multiple causes of dementia with well-characterized evidence of neuro-
inflammation, AD and vascular protein abnormalities; and the New Mexico population includes rural low-income
residents and a majority minority population (50% Hispanic/Latinx and 10% American Indians, living on Pueblos
and Reservations).The Neuropathology Core will have access to the UNM Brain Bank with over 265 archival
brains, including blocks and slides from this population, and is positioned to collect brains prospectively from
study participants who had ante-mortem neuro- and vascular imaging, CSF biomarker measurements, and
cognitive tests, as well as from age-matched community members with or without dementia. All donors are
consented, and autopsies performed at the top-ranking New Mexico Office of Medical Investigator. The
Neuropathology Core will continue to work closely with the other cores of NM ADRC. Significance of this core’s
contributions include: i) Acquisition from under-represented populations; ii) Focus on white matter, vascular and
inflammatory disease. Our Innovations include: i) Ante-mortem/post-mortem MR imaging with co-registrations
and pathology correlates; (ii) development of double-label IHC; and (iii) spatial transcriptomics at high,
subcellular, resolution. Specific aims are four-fold: 1) Acquire, dissect, diagnose, store, and share post-mortem
materials; 2) Develop histopathological strategies to assess vascular and inflammatory biomarkers; 3) Explore
spatial transcriptomics of cognitive impairment in AD and VCID; 4) Develop bidirectional interactive teaching
materials to educate the public and ourselves on the cultural and scientific value of AD research. Resultant well-
characterized biological material, data, generalizable protocols and novel teaching materials will be shared
broadly to investigators both at and beyond UNM, for work aimed at translating what we have learned about
progression-related biomarkers as intervention targets, and to further promote community engagement."
10868315,"PROJECT SUMMARY – OUTREACH, RECRUITMENT, AND ENGAGEMENT CORE (OREC)
The theme of the proposed New Mexico Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (NM ADRC) is to understand
vascular and inflammatory contributions to Alzheimer’s disease and progressive cerebrovascular disease in un-
derrepresented groups in New Mexico, most of whom are rural-dwelling elderly, Hispanic/Latino, and/or Ameri-
can Indian groups. To facilitate representation of persons from these groups, traditional recruitment-focused and
ad-hoc outreach activities must be replaced by intentional bidirectional engagement with community leaders and
members. NM ADRC Administrative and Overall Cores recognize the need for this shift in focus, highlighting
relationship-building and representation in Administrative Core Specific Aim 1 – Expand on the P20 infrastructure
to establish working relationships with medically underserved and underrepresented groups across New Mexico
– and Overall Core Specific Aim 1 – Recruit and retain a large cohort of individuals with cognitive disabilities,
particularly those medically underserved and underrepresented groups. This new Outreach, Recruitment, and
Engagement Core (OREC) will support the aims of the NM ADRC by engaging multiple levels of stakeholders
from URGs to help address disparities in AD/ADRD research. Guided by prior P20 successes and evidence
related to disparities in AD/ADRD research and care, the OREC will pursue four specific aims: 1) Initiate new
engagement activities that identify needs and resources of multiple levels of stakeholders (people with dementia,
caregivers, local community [professional, lay]) related to regional and national priorities in AD/ADRD research;
2) Participate in and conduct activities that build a “deep fund of good will” in lay communities; 3) Sustain effective
ongoing outreach activities and initiate new outreach activities that are responsive to local multilevel stakeholder
needs; and 4) Facilitate recruitment and retention of diverse participants at all points of the dementia spectrum
into the Clinical Core and ancillary studies. The first and second aims will cultivate mutually respectful and ben-
eficial relationships through giving first before any research requests, promoting sustainable programming, and
listening carefully to community leaders. The third aim will create more dementia-friendly communities of care
and participation while honoring the critical contributions to science by persons living with AD/ADRD and their
caregivers. The fourth aim will align rigorous ADRC trial protocols with the expressed needs and comfort levels
of New Mexican and tribal communities. The OREC will interact with all other NM ADRC Cores to achieve its
specific aims. Accomplishing the aims above will increase the research readiness of underrepresented rural,
Hispanic/Latino, and American Indian communities and, subsequently, their representation in AD/ADRD re-
search. Ultimately, knowledge gained from their representation will inform AD/ADRD prevention, detection, and
care, so that the heavy global and individual burden of this devastating disease can be eased."
10868316,"PROJECT SUMMARY – BIOMARKER (FLUID) CORE (BMC)
During the NMeADRC, we identified specific MRI- and fluid- based biomarkers to classify ADRDs into vascular
and neurodegenerative contributions. Currently, AD diagnosis uses the NIA/AA formula with A+ (A), T+
(phosphorylated tau at threonine 181), and N+ (neurodegeneration) as surrogates in diagnosis. These require
invasive lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid or costly Positron Emission Tomography scans. The BMC has
two ultrasensitive assay instruments, MesoScale Discovery and Quanterix HD-X, to assay for plasma
biomarkers, such as neurofilament light (NfL) and glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP). In addition, we have
measured blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCEMRI) and albumin
index as an indicator of inflammation. Importantly, biomarkers improve patient classification. We developed a
clustering method to separate patients based on CSF AD proteins and MRI white matter injury (the double
dichotomy method) that classified subjects into AD, VCID, MX, and controls. We have further improved this
approach with a larger cohort from the ADNI database and the addition of a cognitive axis (trichotomy method).
This expands the diagnostic formula to ATNVI formula by adding neurovascular (V) and neuroinflammatory
biomarkers (I). The availability of plasma-based biomarkers will be a major benefit for the rural populations in
New Mexico. They will allow for population screening for early AD patient inclusion in the emerging clinical trials
for AD. This focus on vascular disease and inflammation is especially important in the minority populations of
rural New Mexico because of the high incidence of vascular disease in this population. Early identification of at-
risk individuals we provide the basis for studies of prevention in these populations of Hispanics/Latinos (H/L) and
American Indians (AI) that are rarely included in such studies. The BMC will also share fluid samples and
biomarker data (where allowed) with NACC to support national initiatives in understanding the etiological factors
of AD/ADRDs in diverse populations and thus meet the goals of NAPA. The specific aims of the BMC are Aim
1: To establish a state-of-the-art infrastructure for sample collection, biobanking, biomarker analysis, and
prioritization to assess AD/ADRD risk and early onset and to track progression. Aim 2: To validate the plasma-
based biomarkers by correlation with indicators of inflammation developed in MarkVCID and cognitive
impairment from neuropsychological testing. Patients with multiple etiology dementia will be identified by injury
to the white matter shown by MRI and AD proteins in the blood. We will develop a pipeline for sharing resources
and supporting developmental work on AD/ADRD at UNM and across New Mexico. Aim 3: To integrate with
other Cores to identify risk factors, prevalence, and prognosis of AD/ADRDs using plasma-based biomarkers to
improve diagnosis and care of the medically underrepresented rural populations of New Mexico and to use the
resources at the NM ADRC to train the next generation of researchers."
10868319,"PROJECT SUMMARY – NEUROIMAGING CORE (NIC)
The Neuroimaging Core (NIC) supports the overall goals of New Mexico Alzheimer’s Disease Research
Center (NM ADRC) by providing advanced imaging and data analysis techniques to understand vascular and
inflammatory contributions to Alzheimer’s disease and progressive cerebrovascular disease in New Mexico,
which includes underrepresented groups consisting of American Indians (AI) and Hispanic/Latino (H/L)
populations. At the same time, the neuroimaging goals outlined by the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center
(NACC) will be met. In collaboration with the Clinical Core and the Data Management and Statistics Core
(DMSC), we will develop susceptibility/risk and disease progression biomarkers for vascular contributions to
ADRD. The NIC also will provide anti-mortem, post-mortem, and fixed brain MRI images to the Neuropathology
Core to compare with histopathology results. The NIC will collaborate with the Outreach, Recruitment, and
Engagement Core to educate and train researchers in advanced MRI imaging and analysis methods, and offer
community-based lectures on benefits of neuroimaging. Our Specific Aims are:
Aim 1: Support the NM ADRC with advanced imaging techniques and meet neuroimaging goals of the
National Alzheimer’s Project Act
 1.1: In addition to the standard Standardized Centralized Alzheimer’s & Related Dementias Neuroimaging
 (SCAN) MRI protocol, we will provide access to new and advanced MRI techniques. These include methods
 for measuring blood-brain barrier permeability, quantitative MRI methods for T1 and T2 measurement, and
 CVR measurement.
 1.2: Scan rural NM American Indian and Hispanic populations using a 1.5T mobile MRI scanner.
 1.3: Initiate a PET program for amyloid and tau imaging in collaboration with the UNM Department of Radiology.
 1.4: Relate fixed brain images to ante-mortem and post-mortem scans for comparison to histopathology.
Aim 2: Develop composite markers to differentiate AD and mixed dementias using MRI, fluid, and
neuropathology data.
We will assess CVR as a biomarker in AD and mixed dementias, contrasting it with other MRI metrics of vascular
damage. We will model composite predictors that differentially detect early AD and mixed dementias.
Aim 3: Train early-stage faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate/medical students in neuroimaging
techniques in ADRD.
Leveraging the unique and diverse NM population, the NIC will satisfy the NIA ADRC program goals, integrate
dementia-related studies at University of New Mexico under one umbrella, and provide the NM population with
access to state-of-the-art neuroimaging tools for ADRD diagnosis and prognosis."
10868320,"PROJECT SUMMARY- RESEARCH EDUCATION COMPONENT
The Research Education Component (REC) will develop and implement a robust educational program to
increase access to highly inclusive training for diverse Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD)
rising researchers and research workforce. The REC will be building on the University of New Mexico (UNM)’s
strengths as a minority-serving Institution (MSI), as well as the only Research University in New Mexico to
advance innovative ADRD research education that is scientifically and culturally groundbreaking. Consistent with

increase the capacity of the next generation of leading ADRD scientists to champion disruptive and
transformative research that would meet the needs of diverse patients and caregivers nationally, and in the Rocky
Mountains region. The REC aims to: enhance ADRD research by training the next generation of ADRD
diverse scientific leaders (Aim 1); increase access to ADRD research careers by developing and
implementing a plan for a dynamic pipeline that follows a recruitment plan to enhance diversity (Aim 2);
and create a dynamic educational environment that supports multi-disciplinary, inclusive science
research skills of researchers and research workforce (Aim 3). Our plan is to provide mutually beneficial
training opportunities to many trainees across different platforms. The REC is ideally poised to facilitate such
interactions, providing communication, oversight, and coordination that can boost the interactive nature of our
center. By applying principles of and culture-centeredness, we will broaden the scope and impact of ADRD
research and prepare a new generation of ADRD researchers who will design and carry out disruptive,
translational studies and bring their newly acquired skills to serve diverse patients. This ADRC will play an
important role in solidifying a culturally informed infrastructure for basic and clinical ADRD scientific mentoring
of promising trainees who are representative of NM communities. In addition to the development of new leaders
devoted to ADRD research to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment and eliminate health inequities in
ADRD, the NM ADRC will contribute to the field by developing and disseminating novel research education
training models, and in particular those focusing on understanding vascular and inflammatory contributions to
Alzheimer's and cerebrovascular diseases, culture-centered mentoring, and engagement of minoritized groups
in research and clinical trials within the ADRC national network and beyond."

Epilepsy is a prevalent pediatric neurologic condition that remains treatment-resistant for 30% of patients. It is
increasingly recognized as a disorder of brain networks, with network changes shown to underlie seizures,
neurodevelopmental impairments, and treatment effects. Limited targeted therapies for epilepsy have been most
successful in high-risk populations when administered before seizures start, suggesting that they may prevent
pathologic brain network changes. Assessing the development of brain networks using functional connectivity
(fc) is therefore a promising technique for early prediction of epilepsy and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Thus,
to evaluate network changes as susceptibility markers, fc must be studied prospectively in populations at risk for
epilepsy. Very preterm infants (VPT; ≤32 weeks’ gestation) with high-grade intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH)
have increased rates of childhood epilepsy and may provide important insights into risk stratification if studied
early. This innovative proposal capitalizes on a time-sensitive opportunity to capture a critical period
before/during the development of epilepsy in an understudied, high-risk sample, enabling the identification of
risk biomarkers translatable to future clinical screening and interventions. To identify prospective biomarkers of
epilepsy susceptibility in VPT infants with IVH, the applicant will collect high-density (HD)-EEG data at the
bedside in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in parallel with a longitudinal R01 study collecting functional
(f)MRI data and developmental assessments of VPT infants with and without high-grade IVH. This K23 also adds
collection of early life epilepsy outcomes through a parent questionnaire and medical record review. The
applicant will use HD-EEG to detect clinical EEG abnormalities among VPT infants with high-grade IVH (Aim 1),
reductions in HD-EEG and fMRI measures of brain network connectivity, particularly in injured brain regions
(Aims 1 & 2), relationships between HD-EEG and fMRI connectivity measures (Aim 2), and relationships between
the strength of HD-EEG connectivity metrics, developmental outcomes, and a diagnosis of epilepsy in early life
(Aim 3). This award provides the applicant, a uniquely qualified pediatric epileptologist, formal training in
quantitative HD-EEG analyses and source localization, multimodal fc analyses, and developmental assessments
at an institution deeply committed to early career physician scientists, featuring field leaders in epilepsy,
neuroimaging, computational neuroscience, neurodevelopment, and one of the country’s largest NICUs. The
applicant’s multidisciplinary mentoring team assembles senior investigators with expertise in early life epilepsy,
neonatology, neurodevelopment, electrophysiology, functional neuroimaging, and advanced computational
methods. The foundational data and training from this K23 award will play a pivotal role in launching the
applicant’s independent career as a physician-scientist, preparing her to direct future studies to identify epilepsy
risk markers and assess disease-modifying treatments for infants and children at highest risk."

People infected with HIV can expect a near normal life on antiretroviral therapy. In the United States, cancer
has become the leading cause of death in the aging HIV-positive population. This includes the AIDS-defining
cancers Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and lymphomas, such as primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). Globally, KS is the
leading cause of death in the HIV-positive population today. Furthermore, as the HIV-positive cohort ages they
are at an increasing risk of developing KS, which is age dependent even in HIV-negative KSHV-carriers.
We, and others, have shown that KS and AIDS-associated lymphomas are highly dependent on the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway for survival. We previously reported that mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin
was efficacious in mouse models of KS and PEL and that rapamycin exhibited a direct anti-tumor effect
independent of immune modulation. This led to a successful clinical trial and first line use of rapamycin-
derivates in HIV+ and HIV- transplant KS.
In this application, we propose to investigate additional targets that impinge on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in
KSHV-associated cancers, as a model of HIV-associated cancers that are critically dependent on this pathway
for their survival. We also propose to utilize CRISPR screens, novel compounds, and innovative combination
strategies to delineate the molecular mechanism of different therapeutic targets. These investigations will
uncover the next generation of therapies against KS and lymphoma in the context of HIV infection. Importantly,
we propose to mostly evaluate drugs that currently are in human phase I safety trials or have passed phase I
safety trials. Thus, the advances made with the studies proposed in this application will be immediately
available for use in clinical trials for HIV-associated KS and lymphomas."
10866149,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adult mammalian brains have a remarkable plasticity, but its study in humans is challenging to conduct because
real-world needs and experiences are frequently unexpected or unpredictable. This proposal focuses on the
basic science of neuroplasticity in adult brains by studying early cochlear implant use in humans and rodents.
Cochlear implants are auditory neuroprostheses that restore hearing and speech perception to humans with
severe or profound hearing loss. Attaining adequate speech perception, however, does not happen
instantaneously and can take weeks or months, and in some rare cases years. This proposal aims to investigate
how the brain coordinates early adaptations to cochlear implants, resulting in something that is initially
unintelligible (i.e., initial cochlear implant use) becoming behaviorally meaningful. Understanding these
neuroplastic processes promises to guide strategies for neurorehabilitation including setting expectations for
outcomes, counseling on how holistic real-world experiences factor into outcomes, and developing therapeutic
targets for improving outcomes.
My long-term career goal is to establish an independent research program that investigates the fundamental
mechanisms and impactful outcomes of neuroplasticity within the auditory system in relation to cochlear implant
function. I propose to expand my skillset with additional training in longitudinal studies of human cochlear implant
users and to perform complimentary studies in rodent models of cochlear implant use. During the K99 phase of
the award, I will continue working toward independence by acquiring the remaining and essential tools and skills
to establish and run a lab. This includes attending workshops on putting together a successful job application
and chalk talk, learning effective strategies for the job interview, and developing lab management tools. By the
end of the R00 phase, I will have a strong publication record and preliminary data needed for a successful R01
application.
The K99 phase of the award will take place at the New York University Langone Medical Center, spanning the
Neuroscience Institute, Department of Otolaryngology, Cochlear Implant Center (CIC), Clinical and Translational
Science Institute (CTSI), and Rusk Rehabilitation. My primary mentors Dr. Robert C. Froemke and Mario A.
Svirsky have a combined 60+ years of experience in neuroscience, neuroplasticity, and neuroprosthetics, I will
benefit from their expertise and mentorship in rodent and human studies of cochlear implant use. Additionally,
with the support from Dr. Karen Adloph, Dr. John-Ross Rizzo, and Cochlear Ltd. I will begin to study how early
cochlear implant use in the real-world engages neuroplasticity within central auditory pathways to improve
speech perception."
10866261,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nigeria has the highest burden of maternal mortality globally with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP)
contributing significantly to these deaths and posing long-term risks for adverse cardiovascular health. A large
proportion of maternal deaths occur during the postpartum phase when care transitions between obstetricians
and other providers. This phase has become crucial for monitoring and treating women, emphasizing the
urgent need to address the knowledge-to-action gap in implementing evidence-based postpartum care
practices. Dr. Mahmoud led the design and conduct of a feasibility study to contextualize and evaluate
implementation of a postpartum blood pressure (BP) monitoring program in women with HDP in Abuja, Nigeria.
The study achieved high adoption (100%) and 6-week retention rates (97%), demonstrating the feasibility of
implementing a postpartum home BP monitoring program. Based on these findings, the program was adapted
to address key barriers identified during the formative study resulting in the creation of the HDP
Implementation Bundle. This career development award proposal includes a type 1 hybrid, stepped-wedge
cluster randomized trial among 4 sites and 900 women with HDP in Nigeria, to evaluate the preliminary
effectiveness and implementation of the HDP Implementation Bundle in improving postpartum BP control
compared with usual care. The study will include a formative qualitative study to guide further adaptation of
strategies included in the HDP Implementation Bundle using FRAME-IS, an evaluation of preliminary
effectiveness that will be assessed by between-group difference in change in systolic BP from baseline to 6
weeks (primary outcome), and an assessment of implementation using the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness,
Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) framework. This proposal aligns with research priorities identified
by NHLBI and will leverage implementation science frameworks to guide local adaptation and enhance
success. Dr. Mahmoud proposes training in qualitative research methods, proficiency in implementation,
translation and dissemination science to build on her background in cardio-obstetrics and health policy. This
career development plan will offer pragmatic training in a highly supportive environment with experienced
mentors led by Dr. Mark Huffman at Washington University in St. Louis alongside Drs. Ojji (Abuja), Dávila-
Román (WashU) and Lindley (Vanderbilt). This career development award will provide the necessary training
and support for Dr. Mahmoud to achieve her overarching goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist
in global cardio-obstetrics. Insights gained from this study will pave way for a larger trial to assess the
implementation and effects of the HDP Implementation Bundle on cardiovascular outcomes in a wider
population through an R01 or similar-level grant to support the candidate’s development as an independent
physician-scientist with expertise in global cardio-obstetrics."
10869876,"Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and serious long-term disability with motor impairment
as one of most common complication. Despite significant efforts, effective motor rehabilitation
strategies are still lacking. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a promising non-
invasive brain stimulation technique that combined with motor task training can facilitates
neuroplasticity and motor learning. However, limited understanding of the neurophysiological
effects, dose-response relationship, post-stroke motor outcome, safety, and tolerability issue have
prevented the successful application of tACS in rehabilitation settings. Individual variation of
collateral vessel density it is a critical factor that influence stroke outcome, but likely alters cerebral
blood flow (CBF) and activity-dependent plasticity mechanism that support circuit remodeling and
motor recovery after stroke. Therefore, we hypothesize that monitoring the interaction between
motor rehab training, tACS, and CBF recovery can advance post-stroke rehab intervention. To
address the role of the collateral circulation and CBF in recovery, we will assess the ability of
tACS (10Hz) to improve motor performance in isogenic strains of mice (males and females at 6
and 12 months of age) and compare it with mice without extensive collateral vasculature. Specific
Aim 1: During the four weeks of post-stroke intervention, we will assess the effects of local CBF
increase in response to tACS in conjunction with motor rehabilitation training on long-term motor
function using local CBF as surrogate maker of neuronal activation and dose-response
relationship in WT and collateral-deficient Rabep2-KO mice. Specific Aim 2. To assess the effect
of tACS neuronal and vascular plasticity in relationship with stroke outcome We will compare the
effects of the motor rehabilitation protocol with and without tACS on post-stroke brain
neuroplasticity in relationship to neurological and cognitive function in WT and Rabep2-KO mice.
For our model of stroke, we will use a distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) plus
ipsilateral common carotid artery ligation (CCA) model with reperfusion after 24hr, which is a
suitable model for the study of long-term stroke outcomes in young adult and older mice. This, in
turn, results in consistent infarct size and significant long-term sensorimotor impairment. Rehab
training h to mimic traditional early upper limb motor recovery +/-tACS, (2 dosing groups) will start
72hr after stroke. Long-term recovery mechanisms to be studied include an assessment of motor
performance, which will be correlated with post-stroke neurovascular plasticity, neurological and
cognitive function. Successful completion of this study will determine treatment effect of TACS on
long-term post-stroke motor recovery and utility of CBF as intracranial biomarker for determining
effective stimulation protocol."

Lung transplantation is a potentially lifesaving option for patients with end-stage lung diseases, such as
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, the median survival following lung transplantation is less than
six years, limited primarily by chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). Emerging data suggest that
dysfunction of telomeres, the nucleoprotein caps that protect chromosomes during cellular replication, can
result in IPF. It is unknown whether telomere dysfunction also plays a role in CLAD. Were that to be the case,
the same pathophysiology that necessitated transplant might also underlie its failure. Our preliminary data
show that shorter telomeres in peripheral blood of lung allograft donors predict decreased survival in lung
allograft recipients. We also have found that telomere dysfunction in airway progenitor cells is sufficient to
induce the pathologic hallmarks of CLAD in an experimental murine model. In humans, progenitor cells such
as type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2) can proliferate and differentiate to restore epithelial integrity following
injury. Thus, AEC2 failure, driven by telomere dysfunction, could lead to denuded alveolar epithelium that is
replaced by fibrotic tissue. With the support of this award, we will test the innovative hypothesis that telomere
dysfunction is a molecular driver of CLAD. In Study Aim 1, we will evaluate the associations between telomere
genetic variants and CLAD in a large, established, multi-center cohort of lung transplant recipients. Common
genetic variants resulting in short telomeres will be sequenced, and telomere length will be determined by
quantitative PCR. We will use adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the links between donor
telomere length or genotype and CLAD-free survival time. These findings will help distinguish the contributions
of innate and acquired telomere dysfunction to poor post-transplant outcomes. Study Aim 2 will test the
association between short allograft AEC2 telomeres and CLAD-free survival in a longitudinal cohort. AEC2
telomere length will be determined by fluorescence-in situ hybridization with a telomere-specific probe (Telo-
FISH) on transbronchial biopsy tissues co-labeled with the AEC2 maker, surfactant protein C. We will test the
association between AEC2 telomere length within the first 60 days post-transplant and CLAD-free survival
using adjusted Cox models. This aim will directly assess the link between early AEC2 telomere dysfunction
and CLAD. In Study Aim 3, we will determine whether transplant-associated lung injury and lymphocytic
inflammation are associated with time to CLAD, using a novel murine model of telomere-mediated CLAD
pathology. Overall, this proposed investigation has the potential to challenge our conceptual understanding
of CLAD and inform cutting edge therapeutic interventions. Establishing telomere dysfunction as a molecular

10870064,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease characterized by an obliterative vasculopathy of
the distal pulmonary circulation. Adverse structural remodeling and increased pulmonary vascular resistance
result in cardiac hypertrophy and ultimately failure of the right ventricle, with annual mortality averaging 10%.
Current therapies can improve symptoms and delay disease progression, but there is no cure. There is a critical
need to develop new therapies that effectively halt and reverse the disease by targeting the cellular and
molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of PAH. In Sox17 mutant PAH patients, we postulate
that loss-of-function mutations in the Sox17 gene result in insufficient upregulation of Sox17 during normal
reparative responses to vascular injury allowing increased RUNX1 signaling to drive aberrant angiogenesis.
Thus, our central hypothesis is that loss of repression of Runx1 by endothelial SOX17 predisposes to the
development of PAH through impaired arterial endothelial differentiation and aberrant angiogenesis. To test our
hypothesis, we plan the following specific aims: Aim 1. Determine if endothelial SOX17 deficiency leads to higher
susceptibility of developing PAH. Aim 2. Determine if SOX17/RUNX1 imbalance leads to impaired arterial
differentiation and aberrant angiogenesis following SuHx-PH induction. Aim 3: Determine if Sox17 mutant PAH
patient iPSC-derived ECs have impaired arterial differentiation and defective angiogenic capability."
10870066,"The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate basic principles of chemosensory
perception. It seeks to explain at the molecular and cellular levels how chemosensory
information is encoded. The experimental plan takes advantage of the fruit fly Drosophila
melanogaster as a model system, which allows incisive molecular genetic analysis of
chemosensory receptors and neurons and of the functions that they perform.
 Olfaction and taste have been considered as separate senses since the time of Aristotle.
This project examines the coding of odorants by the taste system; it attempts to bridge the two
systems in an unprecedented way.
 The first aim analyzes physiological responses elicited from taste neurons by odorants in
solution. The aim is designed to elucidate principles by which the taste system encodes
odorant quality and quantity. This aim could provide a new dimension to our understanding of
how odorants are detected and discriminated in a natural context.
 The second aim analyzes behavioral responses elicited by odorants via the taste
system. Four behaviors will be investigated, using olfactory-deficient animals and a diverse
panel of odorant solutions. The relative roles of the olfactory and taste systems in mediating
behavior will be examined. The results of this aim could reveal that a surprisingly wide variety of
odorants can drive behaviors via taste circuits.
 The third aim seeks to identify taste receptors that underlie the responses to odorants.
The aim tests the hypothesis that some of these responses depend on the Ionotropic Receptor
(IR) coreceptor IR25a, together with other IRs with which it acts. The proposed study should
reveal whether an individual taste neuron detects different odorants via different receptors, and
whether an individual odorant is detected by multiple receptors across multiple neurons. This
aim may advance in a new way our understanding of the molecular logic of chemosensory
coding.
 Diseases carried by insects afflict hundreds of millions of people each year. These
insects detect their human hosts, their food, and their mates largely through their chemosensory
systems. This project may lead to the development of new kinds of insect repellents that act on
the taste systems of insect vectors of disease. Such repellents could be useful in controlling
these insects and the diseases that they transmit."

 Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become increasingly integral to the practice of clinical oncology,
where its ability to scalably examine hundreds to thousands of targets now routinely enables identification of
prognostic and therapeutically actionable markers that support the practice of precision medicine. There are
many applications for which it would be useful to detect and quantitate cancer-associated genotypes at ultra-
low levels (<1 in 10,000 or more), such as identifying drug-resistance mutations in tumors, detecting residual
cancer cells after therapy, or early cancer detection. Nevertheless, standard NGS technologies are hampered by
a relatively high error rate (~1 in 100bp), below which true biological variation cannot be distinguished from
noise. Various methods have been proposed to bypass this issue by allowing error correction of NGS sequence
reads, but such techniques require redundantly sequencing individual template molecules at high depth such
that an error-corrected consensus sequence can be produced. As a result, those methods require a large amount
of sequencing power, are costly, and are limited in the number of specimens and genomic targets that can be
examined. They have consequently seen little uptake in clinical use. There remains an unmet need for highly
accurate sequencing methods that are cost-effective, scalable, and allow interrogation of enough gene targets for
meaningful use in clinical practice. We have recently developed a new experimental paradigm, termed “Linked
Duplex Sequencing”, that addresses these limitations. In our approach, we join the two strands of DNA from
an initial template fragment into a single, covalently linked molecule. Error correction of the duplex can be
performed by comparing separate reads from the two linked strands, thereby eliminating the need for redundant
sequencing of template molecules. This innovative technology provides robust error correction with scalability,
cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and quantitative precision, and is compatible with low-to-mid output short read
sequencing platforms (ie, Illumina) that are already in widespread clinical use. In our first Aim, we will develop
workflows to support Linked Duplex Sequencing, will develop supportive bioinformatic analysis pipelines, and
will characterize the cardinal performance metrics of the approach using fresh and formalin-fixed reference
material. In our second Aim, we will develop protocols for the targeted enrichment of genes or variants of
interest for Linked Duplex Sequencing, and will evaluate performance using a variety of clinical materials. This
work will provide information and deliverables with immediate, direct, and transformative benefit to cancer
patients by substantially improving the quality of oncology sequencing assays while imbuing them with
enhanced diagnostic capabilities for the ultrasensitive detection of cancer associated mutations relevant to
disease emergence, relapse, and therapy resistance in routine clinical practice. Our goal is to make ultrasensitive,
error corrected sequencing so inexpensive and straightforward that it will be used as standard operating
procedure for NGS clinical oncology assays and cancer research studies."
10870166,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering a regulation that would reduce nicotine content in
cigarettes to non-addictive levels. This could have profound implications for the health of the US population as
cigarette smoking remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and incurs nearly $170 billion in annual
health care costs. An FDA analysis shows that a reduced nicotine cigarette policy could avert over 8 million
premature deaths through 2100, but no study has evaluated its potential economic impact. It is also unknown
how this policy could affect vulnerable populations, defined as groups at greater risk for poor health due to
social factors or illness and disability. Clinical trials suggest that reduced nicotine cigarettes decrease smoking
among vulnerable populations, but no study has evaluated their potential long-term implications.
I plan to use simulation modeling methods to conduct health and economic impact analysis of a reduced
nicotine cigarette policy for two vulnerable populations: 1) people with major depression, who continue to have
higher smoking rates and less success with quitting compared to the general population; and 2)
socioeconomically disadvantaged women of reproductive age, whose smoking increases risk for adverse
maternal and infant health outcomes. I will extend a simulation model of smoking and depression that I
previously developed to incorporate morbidity and economic outcomes, including direct medical costs and
productivity losses. I will also develop a smoking model specific to women of reproductive age and level of
educational attainment. This model will simulate smoking during pregnancy and its adverse effects on maternal
and infant health, including premature delivery, low-birth-weight, small for gestational age, and sudden infant
death syndrome. For both vulnerable populations, I will simulate the potential effects of e-cigarette use and an
illicit market for normal nicotine cigarettes under a reduced nicotine cigarette policy.
To be successful with this study and accurately assess the impact of the proposed regulation on costs to
society, I need training in economic evaluation. I also need to deepen my understanding of the science of
addiction and acquire background in reproductive health. To that end, I will enroll in formal coursework in cost-
effectiveness analysis, addiction neurobiology, and reproductive health. I will also receive training from my
team of mentors, who consist of NIH-funded investigators in tobacco regulatory science, health and economic
modeling, behavioral pharmacology, and reproductive and mental health. At Yale, I will access a rich research
environment through regular opportunities offered by the Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science, the Public
Health Modeling Unit, and the Program in Addiction Medicine. This award will provide me with the skills and
training I need to become a leading expert in health and economic modeling of addiction in vulnerable
populations, and secure my path to career independence in tobacco regulatory science."

 More than 6 million people live with neurodegenerative diseases in the United States, receiving care and
support from both unpaid care partners and paid workers. The paid workforce is large and diverse, employing
millions of people, most of whom are in occupations that do not require a college degree. The largest occupation
by far is the “direct care” workforce, which consists of 2.4 million personal care aides, 1.1 million nursing
assistants, and 800,000 home health aides. These workers are affected by a range of policies and programs
that vary across states, payers, and healthcare organizations, including differing training requirements, state-
level regulations regarding what services direct care workers are allowed to provide, and reimbursement
strategies that may affect demand for and wages of direct care workers. We have little evidence to guide
evaluation and refinement of policies even as the importance of ensuring an adequately-sized and well-prepared
direct care workforce is growing. There also is an urgent need to identify effective approaches to support direct
care workers in their interface with an increasingly diverse population of people living with dementia and with
other healthcare professionals.
 To advance research on the direct care workforce that serves people living with dementia, we will establish
the AWARD (Advancing Workforce Analysis and Research for Dementia) Network. Workforce researchers come
from a range of academic disciplines (e.g. public health, economics, sociology, medicine, nursing) and are
spread throughout the nation with few centered at any one institution. They often are in separate departments
or research units from scholars with expertise in dementia care, limiting opportunities for interdisciplinary
research collaborations and mentoring of early-stage researchers in the theories and practicalities of conducting
studies of the healthcare workforce. The AWARD Network will offer programs and activities to create a strong
community of researchers engaged in research on the direct care workforce and its role in care for people living
with dementia.
 Activities of the AWARD Network will include: (1) hosting an annual meeting, (2) holding monthly virtual
trainings, webinars, and workshops, (3) organizing two Summer Training Institutes, (4) supporting competitive
research internships, (5) directly funding pilot research, and (6) developing resources and data to harmonize and
accelerate research.
 The AWARD Network will develop infrastructure and relationships to generate research that supports
evidence-based policy and practice to advance the capacity of the direct care workforce in serving PLWD. This
work will ultimately inform policy leaders and healthcare organizations striving to ensure appropriate care and
reduce health disparities for this population."

 Posterior fossa group A (PFA) ependymoma is a type of central nervous system tumor primarily found
in the brain or spinal cord of infants and toddlers. PFA ependymoma is thought to be an epigenetically driven
tumor characterized by a global loss of H3K27me3 levels, which promotes cancer cell proliferation. Polycomb
repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is the sole enzyme responsible for histone H3K27 methylation in mammalian
cells. Low H3K27me3 in PFA ependymoma is dictated by at least two mechanisms, including PRC2 inhibition
and metabolic rewiring. EZH1 and EZH2 are the catalytic subunits of PRC2. The EZH1/2 inhibitory protein
EZHIP (a.k.a. CXorf67) is normally expressed in gonads. EZHIP is abnormally expressed in PFA ependymoma,
where it inhibits PRC2 enzymatic activity using a protein sequence mimicking the H3K27M oncohistone. The
H3K27M-like sequence occupies the lysine-binding channel at the active site of PRC2 and thereby precludes
histone substrate binding. FPA ependymoma cells are addicted to H3K27 hypomethylation, which underlies
enhanced expression of glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolism genes that help fuel cancer cells. PRC2
inhibition by EZHIP ultimately depends on their physical interaction. Using a hybrid approach combining
AlphaFold structural modeling, biochemistry, structural biology, and crosslinking mass spectrometry, we will
clarify an important missing link between EZHIP and PRC2, which we found critical for PRC2 inhibition in the
preliminary study. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will build an atomic model of a previously uncharacterized EZHIP
motif bound to PRC2. We will also show that the newly identified binding interface between EZHIP and PRC2
can be specifically mutated or targeted to relieve PRC2 inhibition. Finally, we will generate a structural model
of full-length EZHIP engaged with a PRC2 holo complex by integrating spatial constraints from crosslinking
mass spectrometry into AlphaFold structural modeling. In Aim 2, we will be focused on the direct competition
between EZHIP and EPOP, a naturally occurring accessory subunit of PRC2, in PRC2 binding. This is an
exciting mechanistic model strongly supported by our preliminary data showing that EPOP competes off EZHIP
from PRC2 and restores H3K27me3 levels in EZHIP-expressing cells. Importantly, we will study the molecular
mechanism of how EPOP may impact the epigenetic and metabolic pathways by disrupting the EZHIP–PRC2
complex in PFA ependymoma cell models. In addition, EPOP-based protein inhibitors of the EZHIP–PRC2
interaction will be optimized and tested both alone and in synergy with metabolism-targeting drugs in the
treatment of PFA ependymoma."

The treatment of patients with high-grade gliomas remains a major medical problem. Transcranial MR guided
focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a unique technology for noninvasive focal therapy in the brain. When enhanced
by microbubbles, FUS can promote the transient opening of the blood brain barrier (BBB) to improve drug
delivery in brain tumors. This technique can lead to more than 4-fold increase in the delivery and penetration of
a range of anticancer agents, including small molecular weight chemotherapeutics. Recent clinical trials have
confirmed the increased BBB permeability observed in preclinical models, demonstrated its safety, and provided
evidence of its efficacy. Despite these promising findings, the number of under-treated (i.e. moderate to low BBB
opening) and over-treated (i.e. MR-evident tissue damage) patients with FUS is above 40%, highlighting the
challenges for translation and the need for new methods and technologies for guiding this minimally invasive
intervention. An outstanding question in the field is how to map and control in the 3D space the microbubble
dynamics that mediate the BBB permeabilization but cannot be detected by MRI. This proposal aims to establish
novel closed-loop methods based on spectrally resolved passive acoustic imaging for mapping and controlling
the cerebrovascular microbubble dynamics through human skull. Moreover, by engineering an innovative
receiver array technology with high sensitivity, wide bandwidth, and adaptive active surface, this proposal will
provide the required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and directivity to detect the weak acoustic emissions generated
by the FUS excited microbubbles through human skull and throughout the brain. This array, which is amenable
to the proposed closed-loop methods, will be integrated to an MRgFUS phased array and used to characterize
the type and strength of microbubble vibration through human skull, expand the treatment window to theoretical
limits (i.e. single microbubble detection) and provide the ability to locally define and refine the exposure settings
during FUS interventions. In addition to optimum exposure settings for safe and robust BBB opening, longitudinal
assessment and quantification of the FUS-meditated changes in BBB permeability is crucial for identifying tumor
and drug-specific treatment windows. By recognizing that the transport across the BBB is bidirectional, it is
hypothesized that cancer soluble molecules can provide a simple, yet safe and effective method to longitudinally
assess the FUS-mediated changes to the BBB permeability and enable monitoring the response to therapy.
Thus, by integrating bioanalytical and computational methods, this proposal seeks to establish a minimally
invasive assay to guide FUS-interventions in the brain. If successful, the proposed methods, technology, and
findings, which will be tested in models of glioblastoma with a small molecular weight chemotherapeutic agent
and under clinically relevant conditions, will not only enable the delivery of tumor killing molecules to high-grade
gliomas but also facilitate the successful translation this potentially transformative FUS intervention to the clinics."

The goal of this short-term research training program is to utilize research training opportunities
in the areas of cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, and sleep disorders to increase the
readiness and competitiveness of students traditionally underrepresented in these areas as they
train for and enter careers in the biomedical research workforce. The limited pool of qualified UR
groups applying to graduate programs points to a clear need for focused mentorship and
training for students from UR groups as they prepare for graduate training. To address this
need, Brown University requests a competitive renewal of NIH NHLBI funding for the
Short-Term Training Program to Increase Diversity in Health-Related Research to permit 17 UR
undergraduate students per year to participate in an intensive 9-week summer research training
experience with exposure to multidisciplinary research directly related to cardiovascular,
pulmonary, hematologic, and sleep disorders.
 This will be achieved by creating immersive learning environments inside and outside
the lab. Selected students are paired with faculty sponsors for training in the lab and interact
with peer and faculty mentors in other academic settings. The specific aims of this program
are:
a) Enhance the scientific education and research skills of its participants;
b) Instill self-affirming practices in participants of this program who, in turn, will model this
 success to their peers;
c) Initiate the process by which participants become life-long learners by helping them to
 develop the skills and habits of scientists and scholars;
d) New Initiative: Foster a continuity of mentorship and training to support the progression
 of underrepresented students along PhD and MD-PhD training pathways and into the
 biomedical workforce;
e) New Initiative: Expose underrepresented students to research and role models to
 increase their competitiveness for PhD or MD-PhD training programs.
This project builds on our previous successes and fortifies efforts to increase the ranks of
underrepresented scholars in doctoral programs and the scientific workforce."
10873045,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Infectious diseases such as HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, and seasonal influenza epidemics and emergence of
new pandemics remain major global health problems highlighting the need for innovative approaches in vaccine
design. The precise kinetics of antigen exposure relative to inflammatory cues is known to play a critical role in
shaping a coordinated cellular and humoral immunity and thereby enhancing the vaccine immunogenicity and
efficacy. Current vaccination strategies, however, do not include mechanisms for the temporal control of antigen
and adjuvant exposure to lymphoid tissues. Here, we propose incorporating synthetic biology approaches
to create nucleic acid-based vaccines where the kinetics of vaccine (antigen and adjuvant) exposure can
be controlled using orally-available FDA-approved small molecule drugs. This strategy is enabled using
self-replicating RNAs termed replicons that encode antigens and cytokine molecular adjuvants and encompass
regulatory mechanisms governed by the FDA-approved small molecule drug, trimethoprim (TMP). This strategy
allows the delivery of replicons encoding antigens and cytokines in vivo with a single bolus injection and then
controlling the amplitude and duration of antigen and cytokine expression by oral administration of TMP. Using
the RNA replicon platform provides several advantages: (i) it allows antigens and cytokines to be produced in
their native conformation; (ii) it self-replicates and therefore persists inside the cells longer than mRNA and
sustains a steady supply of “fresh” antigen and adjuvant; (iii) unlike DNA therapeutics, it does not harbor the risk
of genome integration and also does not require delivery to the nucleus for transgene expression. An HIV
envelope immunogen, known as the engineered outer domain (eOD-GT8), will be used as the model antigen,
and interleukine-2 and interleukine-12 will be used as the cytokine molecular adjuvants.
The Specific Aims of this project are: (1) Generate small molecule-responsive RNA replicon vaccines enabling
control over the dynamics of antigen and adjuvant expression. (2) Identify optimal temporal patterns of antigen
and adjuvant exposure maximizing the protective immunity elicited by replicon vaccines. Results from this project
will establish a vaccine platform that allows modulating and promoting the magnitude and quality of T cell and
antibody responses following immunization by taking a drug available as an oral pill, as a simple and clinically-
translatable strategy to enhance vaccine-induced immunity. In addition, elucidating the optimal cytokine and
antigen exposure patterns that confer protection will provide critical information and insights for use in conceiving
better vaccine design strategies."
10873182,"Approximately 40% of patients with activated B cell (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma DLBCL
relapse or are not curable with current therapies. The mechanism through which ABC-DLBCLs are resistant to
current therapies are unknown but may be linked to the particular spectrum of somatic mutations in these
tumors, which are in concert with complex growth signals provided by the lymphoid tumor microenvironment
(Ly-TME). Many of the hallmark ABC-DLBCL mutations result in constitutive activation of B cell receptor (BCR)
and Toll like receptor (TLR) pathways in these malignant immune cells. Hence these pathways are emerging
as a source of therapeutic targets for the treatment of ABC-DLBCLs. However, to date, existing BCR pathway
inhibitors such as those targeting Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) are active in a limited subset of patients and
only for a short duration (few months), causes of which are unknown. The substantial differences in response
rates and response duration between ABC-DLBCL patients reflect the variable dependencies on BCR and TLR
signaling and/or differential regulation by the Ly-TME. Therefore, Ly-TME seems essential for ABC-DLBCLs in
spite of constitutive action of signaling pathways. ABC-DLBCLs have multiple cooperative and feed-back, and
bypass signaling pathways that promote tumor survival and personalized therapy will require combination
therapeutics to adequately suppress these networks. Unfortunately, the impact of Ly-TME on these signaling
pathways in ABC-DLBCLs and, consequently, on the efficacy of targeted therapeutics are poorly understood.
Therefore, the objective of this R01 is to develop an experimental therapeutics technology with Ly-TME and
determine the role of Ly-TME on ABC-DLBCL survival, signaling, and response to pathway inhibitors of the
Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) paracaspase. By integrating
the results of R01, the team will determine the role of Ly-TME in BCR-MALT1 and TLR signaling in ABC-
DLBCL and determine a more refined dosing scheme. Mechanisms from this R01 will increase “predictive
power” of MALT1 inhibitors, and provide mechanistic clues towards resistance to MALT1 inhibitors, and
discover combinatorial therapy to overcome resistance."
10873184,"The goal of this SBIR Phase IIB proposal is to develop a novel tarocin/-lactam combination agent suitable for
oral administration which could be used to safely and effectively treat patients infected by methicillin-susceptible
and resistant Staphylococcus aureus & Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSA, MRSA, MSSE & MRSE). MRSA
and MRSE are a major cause of bloodstream infections in the hospital and in the community, and are rising on
account of IV drug use fueled by the growing opioid crisis. Indeed, MRSA remains the second leading cause of
mortality by drug-resistant bacterial pathogens in the USA. Treatment routinely relies on vancomycin (VAN),
daptomycin (DAP), or oxazolidinones such as linezolid (LZD) and tedizolid (TZD), but all of these agents have
limitations, including IV-only administration for VAN & DAP, toxicities with prolonged use for LZD & TZD, as well
as growing resistance to all. Conversely, β-lactam antibiotics have historically had the greatest impact of any
class of antibiotics ever to treat bacterial infections, but their efficacy has been eroded by the emergence of
MRSA/E. Reestablishing β-lactams as a standard of care therapy for Gram-positive bacterial infections including
MRSA/E would provide clinicians with a new therapeutic option and would allow for improved antibiotic
stewardship to mitigate resistance to DAP and LZD. Under a preceding SBIR fast-track grant (R44AI136213),
we have discovered and developed a novel class of compounds called tarocins, which selectively inhibit the non-
essential enzyme TarO in Staph, and the resulting depletion of WTA re-sensitizes MRSA and MRSE to the lytic
effects of β-lactam antibiotics. This suggests that the combination of a tarocin with a suitable -lactam would
furnish a useful therapy for MRSA/E based on a safe and familiar drug class. Building on our previous work, the
deliverable resulting from the successful completion of the aims in this proposal would be a mechanistically
novel, safe, and effective PO administered tarocin/-lactam combination agent with bactericidal activity effective
against MDR staphylococci, including MRSA and MRSE, staged to enter IND-enabling studies.
Our aims for this proposal are:
Aim 1. PCC selection of tarocin potentiator suitable for PO administration.
Aim 2. Scale-up and Formulation of tarocin PCC.
Aim 3. Selection of optimum β-lactam partner.
Aim 4. Efficacy studies using tarocin PCC/optimum β-lactam partner combination.

There are no tests to aid in the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is the most common chronic
gastrointestinal condition in the U.S. and is thought to arise in part from gut host-microbe interactions. Here, we
propose to identify novel stool-based IBS biomarkers by sequencing exfoliated host gut cells and microbiota to
non-invasively assess gene expression and microbiome changes in the gut. Our proposed research comprises
two main aims. Firstly, we will establish a stool-based RNA sequencing method optimized for IBS and combine
it with gut microbiome measurements. Secondly, we will apply our method to patient cohorts to identify stool
RNA and gut microbiome features that could potentially diagnose and subtype IBS-D. This project will focus on
diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), using test and validation patient cohorts to determine the accuracy of our
method in distinguishing patients with IBS-D from healthy controls. We anticipate that this exploratory work will
deliver a novel method to generate stool-based biomarkers for IBS-D, thereby improving diagnosis, phenotyping,
and subsequent management of the disorder."

Small Grant Program R03 proposal aims to generate CD43-floxed mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology
and characterize the cell-specific antifungal functions of CD43 in hematopoietic and T cells using conditional
CD43 KO mice. The preclinical model systems have been invaluable, providing insights into the human
system, understanding the immune mechanisms, developing vaccines and immune therapeutics, and
facilitating novel discoveries relevant to human medicine. Fungal infections, in the face of a lack of vaccines,
cause significant mortality, rivaling TB and malaria, and instigated devastating complications during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the continuous rise in the immune-compromised or suppressed population by
both nosocomial and non-nosocomial factors, as well as the expansion of fungal habitat due to climate change,
has heightened the risk of fungal infections and posed a horde of public health challenges. A major limitation in
the immune control of respiratory fungal infections is a lack of knowledge of protective host defense
mechanisms, both innate and adaptive. Sialophorin (CD43) is implicated in viral, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal
infections. CD43 research has shed light on its costimulatory/inhibitory, adhesive/anti-adhesive cell property,
inhibiting or promoting apoptosis, receptor microbes/microbial product, binding several ligands, and in the
aggressiveness of several lymphoid, myeloid, and epithelial cancer cells. The functionality and expression in
several cell types with often counterintuitive phenotypes in the functions of CD43 have clouded our
understanding and myopic views of its cell-specific functions. Regrettably, CD43-floxed mice are unavailable
and are necessary to address much confounding research, including ours. Our preliminary data showed that
CD43 (using global KO) is essential for immunity in a mouse model of pulmonary fungal infections, but we
unexpectedly found its role in non-hematopoietic cells, contrary to our understanding its role in hematopoietic
cells. In line with this, differing from the mouse model of viral infection, we found an essential role of CD43
(using global CD43 KO) for CD8+ T cell responses to fungal vaccinations and vaccine immunity. Therefore, we
propose generating a CD43-floxed mouse to address the cell-specific role of CD43 in immunity against fungal
infections by developing conditional CD43 KO. Our overarching hypothesis is that CD43 is integral in
hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell responses in immunity against respiratory fungal infection. We aim
to (1) generate CD43-floxed mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to develop conditional KO mice and (2)
Characterize CD43-floxed mice by generating conditional KO mice for immunity against fungal pneumonia and
responses to the fungal vaccine. The outcomes of our projects will help advance our understanding of the cell-
specific functions of CD43 during fungal infection and open universal applications in biomedical research to
address confounding roles of CD43 in infectious, transplantation, tumor, and auto-immunity research thrusting
new immunotherapeutic avenues."

Infectious keratitis, also known as corneal infection, is frequently caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses, or parasites.
Each pathogen needs a unique treatment approach. Hence, rapid determination of the underlying pathogen
causing the disease is of utmost importance. However, current gold standard still includes culture of corneal
samples, which not only can take days to identify the pathogen, but also still leads to false negative results in
many cases. The delay in identifying the appropriate treatment strategy causes significant complications and
unfavorable clinical outcomes, including blindness, which is why infectious keratitis is the 5th leading cause of
vision impairment and blindness and the main cause of corneal blindness worldwide. Together, more rapid
methods to determine pathogens are urgently needed, and would present a significant improvement in patient
care. Here, we describe the development of a novel TaqMan-based assay, termed TLLPS (Thermal Lysis Low
Input Pathogen Screen) that can rapidly distinguish between the most common pathogens causing infectious
keratitis, with several advantages over other approaches: First, we designed our system to work with genomic
DNA, which allows avoiding RNA-extraction, reverse transcription steps, and the significant challenge of
heterogeneity emerging from isolating small amounts of heavily degraded RNA from the eye surface. Second,
our assay allows using 1 µl of raw and un-processed biological fluids, which are submitted directly into a thermal
lysis and genomic pre-amplification step, avoiding any purification steps, which would introduce variability and
cause sample loss of the small amounts extracted from the ocular surface. Here we propose to expand and
prospectively validate the assay. Further, we will test the use of ocular swabs for more rapid detection. With the
completion of this proposal, we envision to have developed a clinically feasible, quick, and reliable way to identify
the most common pathogens causing keratitis, and significantly improve patient outcomes through rapid
identification of the correct treatment strategies.

Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) can occur in healthy individuals wearing contact lenses and it is a painful blinding
infection of the cornea caused by a free-living ameba Acanthamoeba. Complications include chronic ocular
inflammation, corneal melting and scarring. Current treatment for AK relies on a combination of chlorhexidine,
propamidine isethionate, and polyhexamethylene biguanide. However, in 10% of cases recurrent infection
ensues, because of the difficulty in killing both trophozoites and double-walled cysts. Therefore, development
of efficient and safe drugs is a critical unmet need to avert blindness. Because AK is a rare disease, there is a
paucity of drug discovery efforts by the pharmaceutical industry and drug discovery for this infection largely
relies on academic research centers. To reduce the cost, time and risk associated with the development of
new AK therapies, we focused on repurposing of the FDA-approved sterol biosynthesis inhibitors pitavastatin
and isavuconazonium for the treatment of AK. Identification of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) inhibitors and
sterol 14-demethylase (CYP51) inhibitors, which are amebicidal, and combination of novel cysticidal assay with
phenotypic trophozoite screen laid the foundation for this proposal. We have generated significant data
showing that (1) pitavastatin and isavuconazonium are potent trophocidals against three clinical strains of A.
castellanii, (2) isavuconazonium sulfate and its major metabolite isavuconazole exhibit low nanomolar potency
against trophozoites, (3) both isavuconazonium and isavuconazole suppress excystment of cysts into
trophozoites, (4) combination of pitavastatin and isavuconazole is synergistic on trophozoites, and (5)
isavuconazole targets A. castellanii CYP51 and parasite HMGR may be a relevant target for pitavastatin.
Based on these results, we propose to 1) evaluate mammalian cytotoxicity and trophocidal and cysticidal
activities of combination of pitavastatin and FDA-approved form isavuconazonium and compare that with the
effect of pitavastatin and isavuconazonium alone, 2) conduct tolerability and pharmacokinetic-
pharmacodynamic studies of topically administered pitavastatin and isavuconazonium, both monotherapy and
in combination therapy and 3) test in vivo efficacy of topical pitavastatin and isavuconazonium, alone and in
combination with each other, in an animal model of AK caused by Acanthamoeba of two different genotypes.
This study is a necessary step toward repurposing of topically administered pitavastatin and isavuconazonium
for the treatment of AK. To successfully achieve the proposal goals, we rely on our existing collaboration that
combines the unique expertise of Dr. Debnath (PI) in Acanthamoeba parasite biology and Dr. Afshari in
ophthalmology. Drs. Debnath and Afshari's expertise and experience in parasitic eye infection has potential to
elevate our drug repurposing platform to a translational level."

The goal of the proposed work is to develop and test innovative health information technology (IT) tools that
support an outpatient geriatrics care Age-Friendly Learning Healthcare System with a point of care clinical
decision support (CDS) system that leverages patient generated health data (PGHD) and electronic health
record (EHR) data and population-level reports that support Age-Friendly Health System care. Age-Friendly
Health System care is a general approach to care – a transformational movement rather than a model of care
– developed and promoted by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. An Age-Friendly Care Healthcare
System provides care for geriatrics patients related to the “4Ms” – what matters most, medication, mentation,
and mobility. Age-friendly care is tailored to the needs and values of geriatrics patients (e.g., what matters
most to them meaning their goals and motivations) as well as assessment and healthcare actions related to
this population’s specific needs such as falls assessments (mobility), avoidance of medications interfering with
what matters most (medications with problematic side effects), and assessment and treatment for dementia
and depression (mentation). Age-friendly care is evidence-based but we need specific and repeatable ways to
gather stronger evidence to support specific age-friendly care actions and to tie this care to meaningful patient
outcomes. To fully realize the potential of age-friendly care using the 4Ms, it is essential to develop and
implement health information technology (IT) systems for effectively harnessing and displaying data at
institutional and point of care levels. Point of care CDS will support clinical practice quality of care. Data display
tools for institutional decision-makers support sense-making by decision-maker users by facilitating their
access to and synthesis of data to detect patterns in screening, understand variation in care practice, and
explore associated healthcare outcomes. Throughout the study, will use the interoperable SMART on FHIR
framework such that the tools we develop can be used across healthcare systems. We will develop prototype
age-friendly care digital tools. We will incorporate PGHD and EHR data relevant to the 4Ms in a 4Ms clinical
decision support (CDS) module built on our existing work in a prototype clinician-facing, dynamic display. In a
process of successive iteration and improvement we will integrate prototype Age-friendly digital tools into
clinical care and optimize workflow. We will complete rigorous assessment of institutional decision-maker,
clinician, and patient and caregiver users’ perceptions of usefulness of the age-friendly digital tools. Tools will
include a 4Ms PGD collection tool, 4Ms CDS tool, and 4Ms outpatient population-level report. We will examine
the associations of age-friendly digital tools at the point of care with comprehensiveness of 4Ms care and
explore additional health outcomes."

 Poor adherence to oral medications is highly prevalent in 40-50% of patients with chronic diseases worldwide.
Close monitoring of medication adherence is a critical part of successful routine patient care and drug efficacy trials but
traditional observation methods of medication monitoring have had limited reliability and scalability. Thus, there is an
urgent need for effective methods of remote patient monitoring to ensure proper medication adherence. Moreover, this need
for remote monitoring and healthcare delivery was accentuated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our proposal seeks to
advance the field of medication adherence monitoring and support.
 A promising novel technology-based intervention, video directly observed treatment (VDOT), has been shown to
improve medication adherence monitoring and support in patients with TB and HIV. VDOT enables patients to use a
smartphone app to record and submit videos of daily medication intake. The health workers are able to access and manually
review the videos remotely to confirm adherence and take follow up actions when doses are missed. Although VDOT is
highly acceptable, effective and cost-saving, its large-scale adoption is limited by the requirement for the manual task of
reviewing daily medication videos. Harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence (AI), we propose to create an innovative
machine learning (ML) model that enhances the efficiency of the VDOT by eliminating the need for manual review of the
medication intake videos by the health workers. We seek to build on our promising results from a ‘proof of concept’ model
that was based on a small sample of video images from TB medication. We will develop a robust and more effective model
that focuses on fine-grained medication ingestion behaviors by patients, not captured in previous ML models.
 We have access to ~20,000 medication intake videos collected from our recently completed VDOT study of
consenting patients with TB in Uganda. This large video image dataset will facilitate the training of a robust machine
learning model for proper detection of medication adherence.
Specific Aim 1: To construct a large, high-quality dataset of video images for training AI models for recognition of fine-
grained patient actions using existing TB medication videos and open source human activities videos.
Specific Aim 2: To develop, train and validate a novel machine learning model for robust recognition of fine-grained patient
behavior.
 The results of this study will provide a robust AI-based model that will be further validated in routine clinical
settings for optimum performance. We expect the new model to serve as tool that will accelerate the adoption of VDOT and
be adapted for various chronic diseases."

A fundamental question in cancer virology is, how do some viruses persist as chronic viral infections that can
lead to cancer? Virus latency–in which the virus does not replicate independently of the host cell or produce
active viral progeny–is required for long term viral escape from immune surveillance. This leads to prolonged
persistence and chronic infection. Latency is well-defined for herpesviruses and retroviruses but not for other
viruses such as Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). This proposal seeks to investigate how MCPyV controls its
own replication to achieve persistence/latency with new technologies developed in our laboratory.
The MCPyV Large T (LT) oncoprotein is a replication helicase needed for MCPyV genome replication. Other
MCPyV viral factors including small T protein, miRNA, circRNA, as well as cellular elements (e.g. Skip-Cullen-F
box (SCF) E3 ligases, Vam6p, USP7) regulate MCPyV replication by changing LT protein accumulation at the
viral origin or by changing LT functional activity.
In Aim 1, we will characterize LT binding and helicase activity by single molecule visualization of LT protein
binding to MCPyV genome DNA using LUMICKS C-Trap. These studies will allow us to directly determine in
situ LT binding, multimerization kinetics, initiation of helicase activity, and, potentially, initiation of DNA synthesis.
This allows us to separate molecular LT binding to DNA from its transcriptional activities that feedback to regulate
LT. Non-origin LT binding sites that may serve as transcription factor binding sites will also be investigated.
Accessory factors regulating LT-origin binding will be determined in subsequent aims. In Aim 2, we will extend
our findings on proteostatic viral latency for MCPyV using CRISPR-Cas9 library screening of 72 clonal cellular
Skip-Cullen-F box (SCF) E3 ligase knockouts to search for novel LT-E3 ligase interactors regulating MCPyV
replication by targeting LT for degradation. Confirmation of these factors will be performed by gene knockout
and mutation of putative LT phosphodegron sites. In Aim 3, we will use live cell imaging of a novel MCPyV
fluorescent reporter virus in a single round replication system to monitor cellular factors, such as cell cycle stage
using FUCCI stable cells, and viral factors found in Aims 1 and 2 to determine when and how these factors
regulate viral replication at the single cell level.
Completion of these aims will build a fundamental understanding on how a small DNA tumor virus
regulates its own replication. These studies make use of new technologies applied by our laboratory to
examine MCPyV replication. Taken together, these aims will define whether a programmed MCPyV latency
lifecycle exists and, if so, how this lifecycle impacts virus persistence. These studies will have direct importance
to the understanding of the genesis of Merkel cell carcinoma and may point toward targeted therapies to control
persistent MCPyV, as well as other polyomaviruses causing diseases among cancer and immune suppressed
patients."

Thalidomide and its analogs, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, have revolutionized the treatment of patients with
multiple myeloma (MM) and other hematologic malignancies. However, therapeutic resistance still limits their
efficacy and represents a critical unmet medical need. These drugs work through a unique mechanism leading
to the targeted degradation of oncoproteins. Because only the protein levels of the drug targets are affected,
they have been difficult to study using conventional technologies. We developed a novel targeted mass
spectrometry assay to measure these proteins and now propose in Aim 1 to use this assay to study the
relationship between the level of thalidomide analog targets and the development of lenalidomide resistance in
patients. In an orthogonal study to identify mediators of thalidomide analog resistance downstream of substrate
degradation I have performed multiple genetic screens in a MM cell line and have identified the retinoic acid
receptor alpha and the nuclear corepressor as potential mediators of lenalidomide resistance. In Aim 2 I propose
to further characterize these genes and their roll in mediating the response to thalidomide analogs in MM cells.
Collectively, this work will further outline two major pathways of resistance to a clinically important class of drugs
and shed new light on methods to overcome resistance. The applicant, Dr. Adam Sperling, is an oncologist at
the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). He spends 80% of his time in translational research and 20% in clinical
practice caring for patients with cancer. He has outlined a five-year career development plan to meet his goal of
becoming an independent investigator in translational research. Dr. Sperling has assembled an Advisory
Committee of internationally recognized experts to provide scientific and career mentorship. He has established
collaborations with experts in cancer epigenetics, mass spectrometry, and applied biostatistics to provide
experimental advice and specific training in the field. Dr. Sperling will conduct this research at the DFCI and
leverage the exceptional research and teaching environment at the DFCI, Harvard, and the Broad Institute. The
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, which harbors an outstanding research community and has a long track record
for successful mentorship of independent physician scientists, is an ideal environment for completion of these
experiments and the realization of Dr. Sperling’s long-term career goal of being an independent physician-
scientist."
10876393,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious illness with extremely high morbidity and mortality rates. Clearly
efficacious treatments are lacking for adults with AN, especially during the post-acute stage following higher-
level care (e.g., residential, partial-hospital program [PHP]). Most patients achieve symptom stability in
intensive treatment, but up to 50% relapse and more experience residual or co-morbid (e.g., affective)
symptoms after discharge. Appropriate outpatient treatment is often unavailable or inaccessible in this stage.
 Despite a rapid growth in the knowledge on the biobehavioral mechanisms promoting AN, this information
has rarely been incorporated into treatment. One set of mechanistic targets increasingly acknowledged as
relevant to AN are those of the reward system. The reward (a.k.a., positive affect or valence) system has been
implicated in maintenance of myriad psychiatric disorders, including common AN co-morbidities (e.g., mood
and anxiety disorders). A wealth of evidence, including our pilot data, suggests that individuals with AN show
deficit reward sensitivity to experiences generally considered rewarding (e.g., social interactions, eating),
similar to those with affective disorders. However, distinct from other psychiatric illnesses, individuals with AN
also show elevated reward sensitivity to weight-loss experiences and cues (e.g., exercise, low-calorie foods).
Starvation in acute AN appears to exacerbate these processes. However, these same problems affect weight-
restored AN, suggesting they represent core illness mechanisms. Although reward anomalies have long been
noted in the literature, currently no treatments for AN designate positive affect as a primary intervention target.
To remedy this gap, we will test whether a remotely-deployed psychosocial treatment targeting positive
affect, Positive Affect Treatment (PAT), can alter reward mechanisms and enhance treatment outcomes in
post-acute AN. PAT is a cognitive-behavioral therapy originally designed to treat mood and anxiety disorders
and adapted by our team to target reward anomalies in AN (PAT-AN). Our pilot data suggest that PAT-AN,
delivered in person or via teletherapy, effectively targets positive affect and reward sensitivity to improve BMI
and eating disorder, anxiety, depressive symptoms. We will extend this investigation to the post-acute period of
AN, during which we expect to even more effectively engage the reward system, due to the removal of the
biological constraints of starvation. Adults with broadly-defined AN (N = 70) leaving residential or PHP will be
randomized to 24 weeks of PAT-AN or active control (psychoeducation and behavior therapy) as adjunctive to
treatment as usual. Treatment will be delivered via the highly accessible and scalable format of teletherapy.
Throughout treatment and follow-up, subjects will complete a novel multimodal battery (e.g., mobile-delivered
and neurocognitive measures) assessing measuring reward sensitivity and clinical symptoms. This project will
allow us to precisely test wither an innovative therapy informed by biobehavioral mechanistic science can, for
the first time, directly target the reward disruptions long believed to contribute to post-acute AN."

Computational modeling methods have been widely applied in protein structure prediction, drug
discovery and enzyme bioengineering to provide atomic-level insight into enzymatic reactions and
functions. Accuracy and efficiency are the two goals that motivate the development of new
methods in this field. However, the methodological best practices are still lacking in achieving high
throughput and accuracy. In quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) and QM-cluster
enzyme modeling, series of decisions such as molecule partitioning into QM and MM regions,
protonation states of residues, and computational setting rely on good understanding of the
problem and knowledge of the enzyme as well as available computational methods. In this
proposed project, machine learning methods will be applied in computational enzyme modeling
for a better and more systematic solution. The proposed project is innovative as it combines a)
data mining and machine learning on published experimental and computational works which will
efficiently and systematically collect knowledge for research; b) machine learning methods can
weigh different components of computational modeling and make optimal decisions automatically;
c) the results of this work will provide a rational strategy for accurate and efficient QM/MM and
QM-cluster simulations in future studies of different protein systems, drug design and even other
scientific research domains. The proposed project will focus on two enzyme systems that will
serve as case studies: a) Chorismate Mutase which is a potential target for designing antibiotics
and b) the Cytochrome P450 superfamily of metalloenzymes which are largely involved in drug
metabolism via various reaction mechanisms."
10875938,"Prehospital pediatric care is a low-frequency, high-stake event. Medication errors and delayed interventions are
common in this domain, which could lead to severe consequences. The occurrence of many safety events can
be attributed to the relative lack of prehospital provider experience and knowledge in the care of acutely ill and
injured children in the out-of-hospital setting. Despite some efforts, there is still a lack of effective cognitive
support for prehospital providers to promote recognition of clinical conditions, reinforce protocol adherence, and
support a shared mental model in the care of children by EMS. In this project, our goal is to design and develop
a novel evidence-based, context-sensitive cognitive aid for prehospital providers to support their treatment of
pediatric patients in the out-of-hospital setting while considering three prominent research gaps: First, prior work
primarily relied on simulation to assess medical errors in prehospital children care. Even though simulation is a
promising approach for identifying medical errors and areas for improvement, the assessed medical scenarios
and identified medical errors are often limited. Second, limited research has focused on developing digital
cognitive aids for prehospital pediatric care that can account for and alert various prehospital pediatric patient
safety events. Third, the challenges of implementing cognitive support interventions in the dynamic, fast-paced,
and cognitively consuming prehospital context still persist and remain unaddressed, such as misalignment
between system design and clinical workflow, and cognitive overload of using the system under time pressure.
Considering these research gaps, we propose three compelling specific aims: 1) Characterize medical errors in
prehospital care of children through a “human-in-the-loop computational approach. 2) Design and develop
cognitive aids for prehospital providers. 3) Implement and evaluate the proposed technology solution in simulated
environments. To carry out these research activities, we formed an interdisciplinary team consisting of experts
from pediatric emergency care, human-computer interaction, natural language processing (NLP), and artificial
intelligence (AI). Our work will contribute novel knowledge, including a comprehensive assessment and
categorization of medical errors occurred during prehospital children care through a large-scale EMS EHR data
analysis, approaches to generate decision recommendations, and design insights regarding how to present
cognitive supports and suggestions to fast-paced medical teams in an easy-to-absorb, less distractive manner
to avoid alert fatigue and disruptions to workflow. This proposal aligns with the priorities of NIH in developing
novel digital health technologies to improve healthcare services delivery at the point of care."
10880571,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
More than one million women undergo labor induction in the U.S. annually and over one-third of inductions end
in cesarean delivery (CD). While many factors contribute to the CD rate, shifting the start of labor induction (e.g.
cervical ripening) from an inpatient to outpatient setting is an intervention that can shape the early course of
labor and significantly reduce the risk of CD. Possible mechanisms for the lower CD rate include improved sleep
and relaxation at home, but also decreased time in the hospital and in turn, a decrease in medical interventions
as well as a decreased exposure to variability in the diagnosis of abnormal labor progress. Based on published
evidence that reduced time in the hospital is associated with reduced interventions, as well as early effectiveness
data from small studies of outpatient Foley, we hypothesize that shifting the first part of the induction process
from hospital to outpatient setting will be a promising and underutilized way to decrease CD rates.
Furthermore, care delivery at home, in the outpatient setting, has been shown to improve healthcare utilization
and cost by decreasing time in the hospital within internal medicine. The COVID-19 pandemic has further
highlighted now as a critical time to think of novel and innovative ways to keep patients out of the hospital. This
will be the first large, multicenter trial on outpatient cervical ripening powered to determine both effectiveness
and safety of outpatient Foley.
We propose a large (2300 women), multicenter, pragmatic, randomized trial to test the central hypothesis that
outpatient cervical ripening with a Foley catheter will 1) decrease the primary CD rate and 2) reduce maternal
and neonatal morbidity. Given the long time-lag between effectiveness studies and widespread implementation,
we will additionally explore barriers and facilitators to implementation to enable rapid uptake and dissemination
of our findings. Through a Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study, we will pursue the following specific
aims: (1) Determine the effectiveness of outpatient Foley for cervical ripening in reducing the rate of CD among
nulliparous women undergoing labor induction, (2) Determine the effectiveness of outpatient Foley in reducing
maternal and neonatal morbidity and improving patient satisfaction, and (3) To characterize patient, provider,
and organizational implementation determinants relevant to outpatient versus inpatient cervical ripening with a
Foley catheter. Additional analyses will also compare maternal and neonatal resource utilization.
A trial of this size and rigor is critical to changing the standard of care for millions of delivering women.
Of critical importance, even if our primary effectiveness aim is negative, we will be powered to evaluate
secondary effectiveness and safety outcomes, and the primary implementation aim will yield insight into
ways to improve the induction process for thousands of patients through comparison of implementation
determinants and resource utilization between the two arms."

Adolescents and young adults (AYA) ages 13-24 accounted for 21% of new HIV diagnoses in the United
States in 2019. New infections in AYA disproportionately affect Black, Latino, multiracial, and American
Indian/Alaska Native men who have sex with men. Geographic areas of the United States are also
disproportionately affected by new infections: Northeast > South > West followed by the Midwest. The specific
aim of the applicant is to serve as the Operations and Collaborations Center (OCC) of the Adolescent Trials
Network (ATN). Westat is in an ideal position to expertly perform the ATN OCC scope of work (SOW) as
outlined in RFA-HD-23-021 due to our prior and current successful experience supporting HIV pediatric and
adolescent research programs. The newly designed ATN network will be made up of a Scientific Leadership
Center (SLC) and OCC. As the OCC, Westat will work collaboratively with the ATN SLC and provide
operational and logistical infrastructure to support the ATN Executive Committee (EC). This is critical to the
EC's success in achieving its scientific leadership agenda and in its collaborations with the ATN External
Scientific Panel (ESP), National Institutes of Health (NIH) program staff, and external research networks and
investigators. The overall aims of the ATN OCC are to: (1) Provide administrative management and coordinate
Network external collaborations; (2) Provide operational support for cross-network protocols, collaborations,
and other projects (e.g., conduct trainings, develop manuals of operation, Network public support relations,
provide Network website maintenance, support communications and conference calls, convening committees
and meetings); (3)Train Network participants on a breadth of research-related topics; (4) Manage resources
and execute performance-based subcontracts with site consortiums, vendors, and collaborators; (5) Provide
regulatory infrastructure for cross-network protocols, collaborations, and emerging projects (e.g., site
performance monitoring, quality assurance procedures, and protocol registration); (6) Provide mechanisms and
metrics to monitor subject screening, recruitment, retention, and dropout, and procedures for adjustment if
enrollment targets are not being met; (7) Provide detailed systems for tracking study progress and
performance of site consortia and reporting to the EC (e.g., support of a study progress and performance
monitoring committee). Routine tracking and reporting will include defined metrics, milestones, timelines, and
quality-control measures to ensure studies stay on track and within budget. Relevance: Westat will provide the
appropriate technical, organizational, administrative expertise, and resources to efficiently design, implement,
and simultaneously manage a broad portfolio of therapeutic, behavioral, and community studies. Study findings
will be used to develop interventions for reducing HIV transmission and acquisition among AYA, safe and
effective forms of long-acting HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and long-acting antiretroviral therapies
(ARTs) for improving adherence and long-term health outcomes of AYA living with HIV (LHIV)."
10880696,"Project Summary/Abstract
Colorectal cancer (CRC), the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the US, can be prevented
through colonoscopy, during which potentially pre-cancerous polyps are removed from the colon. Serrated
polyps may precede up to 30% of CRC, but unlike adenomatous polyps (their more common counterparts),
there is limited data about their outcomes and natural history. Current clinical guidelines highlight that there is
a critical lack of evidence available on future risks in patients with serrated polyps. To address this
knowledge gap, this project proposes to combine the comprehensive data on colonoscopy patients,
procedures, and pathology of the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry (NHCR), which has been collecting
data from endoscopy sites across NH since 2004, with the statistical and risk prediction modeling expertise of
the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College and the internationally recognized micro-simulation
modelers of the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Network (CISNET). The development and application of
microsimulation models to characterize how digestive diseases progress is a key need for improving public
health.
In Aim 1.1, NHCR data, including key information on polyp subtype, size and location in the colon as well as
the interval between index and subsequent colonoscopy, will be used to develop a risk-prediction model that
can generate accurate personalized estimates of future risk in patients with serrated polyps. In Aim 1.2,
NHCR data on patient risk factors and characteristics will be added to this model, to further refine the
personalized estimates of future risk. In Aim 2.1, these risk estimates and additional NHCR data from patients
with serrated lesions will be used by members of the CISNET Colorectal Group to inform and expand
existing colorectal cancer micro-simulation models (SimCRC and MISCAN), and, in Aim 2.2, adding data
from the literature, to validate these models. Aim 3.1 will use these expanded micro-simulation models to
assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of recommended follow-up intervals for colonoscopy
surveillance in patients with serrated polyps, stratified by specific polyp characteristics. Aim 3.2 will use
the models to assess the effectiveness of recommended follow-up intervals for surveillance in patients with
serrated polyps stratified by both polyp and patient characteristics.
By linking the data of the NHCR with the biostatistical tools of risk-prediction and micro-simulation modelling,
this study will significantly advance the scientific evidence-base and transform the landscape of serrated polyp
management, helping colonoscopy achieve its tremendous potential for reducing CRC incidence and mortality."

research experience in basic or clinical investigation, complemented by a didactic component appropriate to
the training goals. The trainees are primarily MDs and MD/PhDs who desire careers in investigative
endocrinology and academic medicine, as well as PhDs who want further research training. The trainees are
selected from a large applicant pool on the basis of prior academic and/or research achievement and evidence
of strong commitment to a career in biomedical investigation. The Program Director (K. Miller) and the
Associate Director (J. Florez) are senior Physician-Scientists who govern in conjunction with the Endocrine
Division Education Council, a committee of experienced endocrine scientists. The faculty consists of 42 active,
well-funded scientists, whose interests range broadly across the subdisciplines of endocrinology and from
clinical, bedside investigation to genetic and molecular mechanisms. The trainees are supervised closely by a
primary faculty mentor, and interact extensively with junior faculty, who often serve as co-mentors. In addition,
individual Scientific Advisory Committees provide ongoing scientific and career counsel. Internal and External
Advisory Committees provide evaluation and recommendations for Program improvement. Formal Program
and Mentorship trainee surveys and frequent (at least twice annual) one-on-one meetings between the
Program Director and trainees provide specific actionable input re: the Program and mentorship. An extensive
program of didactic sessions complements the research activity. This includes several weekly scientific series,
including Endocrine Grand Rounds, and a monthly Career Development didactic series designed for the
Training Grant trainees specifically. The productivity of past trainees during training has been very high overall,
as judged by the number and quality of trainee publications, number of trainees who obtain subsequent grants

Novel statistical and computational tools have enabled the broad adoption of genomics technologies and served
as the foundation for the modern age of human genomics. Indeed, the recent advent and popularity of single cell
genomics platforms – most notably single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) – has led to a proliferation of single-
cell data processing, QC, and analysis frameworks. However, to fully realize the promise of single cell genomics
approaches we need to connect cell-type level regulatory phenotypes with complex disease. The most promising
approach to this challenge is to identify functionally relevant genetic variation by mapping quantitative trait loci
(QTLs). Indeed, studies identifying regulatory variation associated with a number of regulatory phenotypes,
including but not limited to gene expression (eQTLs), DNA methylation (meQTLs), chromatin accessibility
(caQTLs), and protein (pQTLs), have been carried out extensively in bulk samples. These studies have
advanced our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of complex disease, but the lack of granularity
provided by bulk analyses continues to hinder progress. As we move these approaches towards the cell-type
level analyses enabled by single cell genomics it has become clear that the methods developed for bulk samples
are not well suited to handle the complexity and specific characteristics of single cell data; or indeed to take full
advantage of the resolution and richness of single cell data. Here we propose developing, validating, and
deploying methods for mapping QTLs using data from single cell `omics technologies. We believe it is critically
important to build these methods using relevant data obtained from primary human tissue in a disease state.
Thus, we will jointly collect scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and single cell protein levels from two tissue types: lung
and peripheral blood collected from patients with pulmonary fibrosis (PF) or healthy controls. This data collection
will be facilitated by our existing biorepository and build upon our expertise building tools for analyzing genomic
data, mapping QTLs for regulatory phenotypes, and analyzing scRNA-seq collected from lung tissue from
patients with PF. Using these data we will build methods for univariate scQTL mapping, multi-omic scQTL
mapping, the identification of context specific scQTLs, and integration of scQTL results with the results from
GWAS studies. These methods will be released as open-source software packages enabling broad adoption by
the field. Our team brings together unique expertise in statistical genomics, computational biology, functional
genomics, single cell genomics, and disease specific expertise in PF making us particularly well suited to carry
out this work."

Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, progressive adult-onset autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder
characterized clinically by cognitive, psychiatric and motor deficits. Degeneration of striatum medium spiny
neurons (MSN) is the most prominent neuropathological change observed in HD. At present, there are no
neuroprotective treatments for HD and symptomatic treatments are also largely ineffective. The mutated
huntingtin (mHTT) protein is widely expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal cells, yet significant
neurodegeneration is only observed for a subset of neurons in the brain. Understanding the toxicity produced
by mHTT in a given cell type, the cellular interactions and underlying molecular changes in HD that contribute
to the classic behavioral deficits and selective degeneration are likely to be critical in the design of effective
therapies for the disease.
 One goal of this proposal is to expand our knowledge of the contribution of full length-mHTT (fl-mHTT)
expressing astrocytes to deficits in striatal MSNs. Astrocytes are critical to the proper function and
development of the nervous system. They modulate synaptic activity and neurotransmission. We have
demonstrated that fl-mHTT expressing astrocytes in conditional fl-mHTT BACHD mice contribute to behavioral
and neuropathological phenotypes observed in HD.
 Electrophysiological studies in BACHD mice revealed increased inhibitory input onto MSNs and a
reduction of tonic inhibition in these neurons. There is increased spontaneous firing of striatal somatostatin
GABAergic interneurons in the BACHD striatum. We found increased extracellular GABA (e[GABA]) in the
striatum of 12 month old BACHD mice that is reduced with a decrease of mHTT expression in astrocytes. In
protein extracted from the striatum of the 12 month old BACHD mice, we identified a decrease in GABA
transporter 1, GAT1. The GAT1 transporter is responsible for uptake of e[GABA].
 Recent studies revealed that astrocytes respond to activation of GABAergic somatostatin interneurons
in the cortex through GAT3 and increases their inhibitory activity onto downstream pyramidal neurons. We
hypothesize that deficits elicited by mHTT in somatostatin interneurons and astrocytes interact to contribute to
the increased GABAergic inhibitory activity onto MSNs. We have designed experiments to assess the
contribution of mHTT expressing astrocytes to the increased inhibition and reduced tonic conduction of MSNs.
Furthermore, we will provide the first assessment of the role fl-mHTT expressing somatostatin interneurons
play in the development of the electrophysiological changes in medium spiny neurons and the HD-like
phenotypes in the BACHD mice. We will also assess whether overexpression of GABA transporters in the
striatum decreases the electrophysiological deficits and e[GABA] observed in MSNs in the BACHD mice."

10881706,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major public health concern. Veterans are at a higher risk for dementia late in life
due to in-service exposures and epidemiological factors. The goal of Dr. Galvan’s research is to understand the
molecular and biochemical alterations that cause AD, with a focus on those that link aging to AD and potentially
other dementias, and to identify interventions to prevent or treat AD. Advanced age is, by far, the greatest risk
factor for AD. A VA Merit-funded project (1I01 BX002211-01A2) in Dr. Galvan’s lab focused on the use of
rapamycin, the first drug that was experimentally proven to slow aging in mice, to treat and/or block progression of
AD. Dr. Galvan’s Merit-funded work led to the first clinical trial of rapamycin in Alzheimer’s disease and established
a novel area of research in the vascular etiology of AD by revealing novel mechanisms of vascular contributions to
cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), an area of high relevance to Veterans’ health and of specific interest
for NIA and NINDS. Pathogenic tau protein is causally implicated in AD. Based on evidence for pathogenic tau
accumulation in vasculature of AD brain provided for the first time by Dr. Galvan’s team, a second VA Merit-funded
project in Dr. Galvan’s lab (5 I01 BX002211-06) will define mechanisms of pathogenic tau-induced brain vascular
dysfunction. Dr. Galvan’s studies are important for Veterans’ health because they will test immunotherapy targeting
pathogenic tau, that can be combined with immunotherapy targeting amyloid-beta, recently approved by the FDA,
to efficaciously treat AD. Molecular damage during aging leads to cellular senescence. Senescent astrocytes
accumulate in aging and are markedly increased in AD. Dr. Galvan’s laboratory showed, for the first time, that
pathogenic tau enters astrocytes, where it potently induces cellular senescence. Collaborative studies
(1RF1AG068283-01) of Dr. Galvan and Dr. Holly Van Remmen (OKC VA Health Care System, VAHCS) will
define mechanisms of pathogenic tau-induced astrocyte senescence, understand its contribution to AD etiology,
and test drugs that kill senescent cells and immunotherapy targeting pathogenic tau to treat AD. With her recent
move to OKC VAHSC and affiliated institution University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC), Dr.
Galvan expanded her established collaboration with Dr. Van Remmen and with Dr. Arlan Richardson (OKC
VAHSC) on the role of necroptosis in the activation of cellular senescence in brain in aging and AD. Dr. Galvan’s
move to OKC VAHCS promoted her established collaboration with Dr. Zoltan Ungvari (OUHSC) on brain
microvascular mechanisms of AD. Funded collaborative work of Dr. Galvan with Dr. Ungvari and with external
investigators Dr. Viviana Perez (OSU, now NIA) (1RF1AG057964) and Dr. Rakez Kayed (UTMB) provided first
evidence for pathogenic tau transmission to brain vascular endothelial cells, accumulation of pathogenic tau in
endothelial cells and endothelial cell dysfunction and senescence in AD. These studies, currently in 2nd round of
review in Nature Communications, showed that tau immunotherapy may be used to treat vascular tauopathy in
AD. Dr. Galvan is co-Investigator in 2 additional NIH grants, an Alzheimer’s Association/Gates Foundation grant
and a Michael J. Fox Foundation grant. She serves as co-Director of the Center for Geroscience and Healthy Brain
Aging at OUHSC, and is involved in leadership of the NIH/NIA P30 Oklahoma Nathan Shock Center of Excellence
in the Biology of Aging (NSC) at OUHSC and OMRF. She served as Core Co-Leader in the NSC and as Associate
Director of the NIA T32 Training Program in the Biology of Aging at her prior affiliated institution, UT Health San
Antonio, and in the GRECC at her prior station, South Texas VAHCS. Dr. Galvan has received eight awards, is
President of the American Aging Association, and serves as Co Editor-in-Chief of Geroscience. Her work has been
cited over 6,400 times with h-index=45. She served in VA BLRD NURD and NURC review panels and is a standing
member in the NIH/CSR CMAD Study Section. Dr. Galvan mentors or mentored a CDA-2 trainee, 4 junior faculty
and clinician/scientists, 4 graduate or MD/PhD students, 2 MD student fellows, and 4 postdoctoral fellows among
other trainees, most of which have gone on to successful careers in science and science-related professions."

autonomic, metabolism and cardiovascular functions are regulated. I am especially focused on
identifying the cellular and molecular processes and circuits that underlie the control of the autonomic

laboratory are also directed towards uncovering how these pathways and neuronal circuits are
dysregulated in disease conditions such as obesity and hypertension, which are major causes of
morbidity and mortality in the VA population. Detailed understanding of the processes involved in
metabolic and cardiovascular regulation in health and disease is necessary to develop new
treatments for complex disorders such obesity and associated diseases. We plan to build on our
previous work to extend our studies to identify new molecular and neuronal processes underlying
metabolic and cardiovascular regulation and their pathophysiological role in obesity. We will focus on
understanding the mechanisms mediating autonomic, metabolic and cardiovascular control by
mTORC1 signaling. We will also investigate the mechanisms involved in autonomic, metabolic and
cardiovascular regulation by a protein complex called the BBSome. New insights into the
physiological and pathophysiological role of mTORC1 and the BBSome will inform the feasibility of
targeting these molecular mechanisms for the treatment of obesity and hypertension. I will also
continue training the next generation of biomedical researchers by mentoring and guiding young
scientists, both basic and clinical, to maximize their career potential as biomedical investigators. This
is crucial to ensure a bright future for medical advances that can improve the health and lives of the
Veterans. In addition, I will continue my commitment to serve the VA, affiliated University of Iowa, and

The overarching goal of Dr. Freeman’s research has been to understand how alterations of the
genome/epigenome contribute to aging and how therapies could potentially target these changes to maintain a
‘youthful’ epigenome that retards aging, delays/prevents age-related diseases, and improves the health and
quality of life of the elderly. Epigenetic dysregulation is a hallmark of aging, but exactly how this contributes to
cellular dysfunction and disease is not known. To elucidate this contribution, Dr. Freeman’s VA research has
focused on epigenomic regulation in astrocytes, microglia, and neurons in the hippocampus with aging. Using
novel cell isolation and advanced sequencing approaches, cell-type specific base resolution maps of both
methylation (mC) and hydroxymethylation (hmC) in CG and non-CG contexts are being generated. With paired
RNA expression data, bioinformatic techniques are being used to understand the regulation of gene expression
with aging. This type of base-specific, genome-wide, and cell-type specific studies have not been performed in
aging research and will potentially offer the most in-depth view of epigenomic changes with aging to date.
Further, to demonstrate the prevention of age-related epigenomic changes, caloric restriction is being used. In
total, these studies will not only increase the understanding of the neuroepigenomics of aging but also provide
targets for future interventional studies using epigenome editing. Importantly these studies examine both males
and females to provide sex-informed insight as his prior studies have demonstrated that the majority of age-
related epigenomic changes are sexually divergent.
Dr. Freeman is also PI or co-PI on three NIH projects and one foundation funded project. These studies extend
his VA research in aging through use of novel transgenic mouse models and anti-aging interventions in the brain,
retina, and GI system. These models developed by his lab allow temporally controlled, cell-type specific tagging
of nuclei and ribosomes to isolate DNA for epigenomic analysis and RNA for expression analysis without the
need for cell sorting. In the brain and retina, heterochronic plasma transfer, in which plasma from young mice is
administered to old mice for rejuvenation, is being used to determine if age-related epigenomic changes can be
reversed after they have occurred. In parallel, using proteomic approaches, DNMT and TET interacting proteins
are being identified that target them to specific genomic regions for epigenomic alteration.
More broadly, Dr. Freeman also has an extensive collaborative portfolio with other OKC VAMC investigators. In
these VA and NIH funded studies, Dr. Freeman is examining cell-type specific mechanisms of aging in muscle,
brain, ovary, joints, and colon. In addition to bringing molecular and biochemical expertise to these studies, a
common thread of epigenetics of aging allows comparisons and contrasts to be made across the organ systems.
These collaborations are paired with his work as Director of the Genomics Sciences Core of a recently renewed
P30 NIA Center grant: the Oklahoma Nathan Shock Aging Center. This core provides epigenomic and
transcriptomic analyses as well as mitochondrial genomic assays for aging researchers across the country.
Additionally, Dr. Freeman leads many cross-institution (OMRF, OUHSC) initiatives focused on trainee and faculty
development, including training students and post-docs (F-Troop) and junior faculty (NeuroGrant Seekers) in
successful preparation and submission of grants. He has also worked with leaders at the OKC VAMC to help
recruit new, highly successful investigators to the VA system, one of which has received a MERIT award with
three more investigators having MERIT applications currently under review."
10878406,"ABSTRACT
Impaired wound healing is an alarming problem in diabetes, attributed to the development of over 750,000
diabetic foot ulcerations (DFU) and 70,000 lower extremity amputations per year in the USA. Single-cell RNA-
sequencing (scRNASeq) analysis provides valuable insights into transcriptional features and disease
pathophysiology by allowing the profiling of individual cells in heterogeneous tissues. A recently conducted study
in our unit primarily focused on divergent characteristics between DFU patients who healed their ulcers (Healers)
and those who failed to heal them (non-Healers) and investigated molecular changes via scRNASeq analysis of
surgically removed DFUs. Our analysis revealed the enrichment of a unique population of fibroblasts,
overexpressing MMP1, MMP3, MMP11, HIF1A, CHI3L1, and TNFAIP6 genes in the Healers. Ongoing work in
our lab has shown that specifically designed alginate bandages that can provide controlled lipid nanoparticle
(LNPs) delivery of modified CHI3L1mRNA, IL-17AmRNA, FGF-2 and IL-2mRNA considerably improve wound
healing in diabetic db/db mice. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that topical wound treatment with new
biomaterials that can release the above mRNAs can lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that combination of various mRNAs with specific temporal delivery can
physiologically imitate the activation of pathways that are associated with DFU healing.
To fully explore our hypotheses, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1.) Develop a modified-mRNA-LNPs
therapeutics delivery system to target different stages of diabetic wound healing and provide proof of concept
regarding their efficacy in wounds of diabetic mice. Alginate hydrogels fabricated into bandages capable of
sustained release will be employed to deliver mRNA-LNPs in 3D human skin equivalents and wounds of db/db
mice. We will identify the most efficient mRNA or combination and the most appropriate dosing and timing of
delivery in improving diabetic wound repair. 2.) Investigate efficacy in a larger animal model, the diabetic Yucatan
minipig and confirm mechanisms of action in both animal models. We will also examine mechanisms of action
of pro-healing mRNA(s) and will compare them to the results from the rodent studies. 3.) Conduct translational
studies in human diabetic wound healing to verify the therapeutic potential. We will conduct ex vivo wound
healing studies with discarded skin from patients with and without diabetes and in vivo studies with wounding of
human skin engrafted onto diabetic nude mice. We will also employ targeted multi-omics analyses to establish
molecular mechanisms of action and compare them with the ones that have been observed in our previous
extensive human studies. We believe that our proposal involves state-of-the-art “bench to bedside” research that
can culminate in the development of innovative new therapeutic approaches. Successful completion of the
project will facilitate the conduction of Phase I/II clinical trials in DFU patients."
10878531,"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects 15% of individuals in the U.S. and is an independent risk factor for
cardiovascular disease (CVD) in multiple meta-analyses and cohort studies. In late stage CKD/dialysis the
phenotype shifts to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), diastolic dysfunction, preserved ejection fraction heart
failure, and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Importantly, in patients with CKD, traditional Framingham risk factors
do not fully explain or predict the increased risk of LVH, diastolic dysfunction, or SCD in patients with CKD
supporting the importance of non-traditional risk factors specific to CKD, called uremic toxins as causative of
CVD in CKD. These toxins include 1) low molecular weight solutes including phosphate and parathyroid
hormone, both inducing arterial calcification and LVH, 2) middle molecules such as fibroblast growth factor 23
that induces LVH, and 3) protein bound uremic toxins that are generated from intestinal microbiota such as
indoxyl sulfate (IS) that are associated LVH and prolonged QT interval in patients. Indoxyl sulfate is a ligand for
the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) important in detoxification and regulation of inflammation and senescence.
Our model of progressive CKD, the Cy/+IU rat, spontaneously develops LVH, myocardial fibrosis, arrythmias,
heart and arterial calcification, and sudden cardiac death, emulating advanced human CKD. Our preliminary
data supports that dietary inulin (non-fermentable fiber) reduced the levels of indoxyl sulfate close to normal and
improved left ventricular mass index, and reduced heart fibrosis, senescence and oxidative stress. However,
inulin did not affect FGF23 nor normalize PTH and these toxins are known to cause LVH, arrythmias, suggesting
an additional contribution to CVD in CKD. We hypothesize that cardiovascular disease in CKD is due to
the interaction of PTH, FGF23 AND the gut microbiome derived uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate. To test this
hypothesis we will test the following specific aims: Aim 1: To determine if concomitant lowering of PTH and
FGF23 with a calcimimetic is additive to dietary inulin to lower indoxyl sulfate in improving cardiovascular
structure, function and arrythmias in a rat model of CKD. Aim 2: To confirm the cardiovascular effects of indoxyl
sulfate are mediated through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in the adenine mouse model of CKD. Primary
outcomes will be cardiac function measures of LVH and longitudinal strain by Echo and ECG in vivo, arrythmias
by optical mapping and left ventricular mass index ex vivo. Additional outcomes are blood levels of indoxyl sulfate
and CKD-MBD, cardiac pathology/gene and protein expression for fibrosis/hypertrophy and connexin,
senescence, oxidative stress, and inflammation. These studies examine clinically available treatments to lower
uremic toxins and determine if doing so results in a reduction of cardiovascular disease in CKD, the leading
cause of death."

IMPACT: Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) is a long-term progressive disease of the liver and gallbladder
characterized by inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts which normally allow bile to drain from the
gallbladder. Patients who suffer from PSC may be asymptomatic or suffer from a myriad of symptoms such as
jaundice, itching and abdominal pain. In addition, most patients with PSC (upwards of 75%) also suffer from
inflammatory bowel diseases like Ulcerative Colitis, thus complicating their treatment strategies. The risks of
PSC include increased incidences of CCA, but also colorectal cancer and gallbladder carcinoma are found in
more patients with PSC then without. The causes of PSC are not fully known; however, some studies point to
genetic links, malfunctioning immune systems and a dysregulation of the gut microbiota. Treatment options for
patients with PSC are severely limited. There is a sub-population of patients who get relief from treatment with
the bile acid, ursodeoxycholate; however, not all patients respond. Liver transplantation remains the most
definitive “cure” or treatment for PSC, but there is a chance of recurrence following transplantation. The estimated
survival time from diagnosis is ~20 years depending upon the stage of discovery and management throughout.
Our work has demonstrated that histamine (derived primarily from mast cells) levels are increased in patients
with PSC and patients with CCA. In addition, we have shown that mast cell numbers increase in these patients
and are found close to bile ducts, thus making this work highly clinically important. This proposal aims to identify
biomarkers and potential novel therapies to both alleviate symptoms and offer curative advances without
transplantation. In addition, since PSC can develop into CCA (which is increased in a subpopulation of U.S.
Veterans), we will also aim to understand the transition of PSC and signaling mechanisms that regulate this
development of CCA."
10878408,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Meiosis is the cell division process in which a diploid cell undergoes one round of DNA replication
followed by two rounds of chromosome segregation to ultimately produce haploid gametes. Errors in meiotic
chromosome segregation can result in miscarriage and trisomy conditions, such as Down syndrome.
Therefore, studying meiotic chromosome segregation is important for understanding how errors in this process
occur. The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms that regulate proper chromosome
segregation, focusing on unique events in meiosis I and meiosis II. These studies leverage the model organism
S. cerevisiae, due to the ease of developing tools to address mechanistic questions. These innovative tools will
allow the investigation of how cells establish microtubule-kinetochore attachments, how cells correct improper
attachments, and how cells monitor the attachments through spindle checkpoint activity, which delays the cell
cycle in the presence of unattached kinetochores. The rationale for the proposed research is that the questions
focus on processes that are unique to meiosis but are likely to be highly conserved, allowing the findings in
budding yeast to uncover general mechanisms of meiotic regulation. Strong preliminary data guide the
following three specific aims: 1) determine how the number of crossovers and crossover position along the
chromosome affects the establishment of correct kinetochore-microtubule attachments in meiosis I; 2)
investigate how cells prevent persistent spindle checkpoint activity during meiosis; and, 3) determine how the
phophoregulation of proteins at the meiotic kinetochore ensure proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments in
meiosis II. In the first aim, strains have been developed to target crossovers at particular locations on a
chromosome arm. Using time-lapse imaging, the strains will be monitored for the timing of establishing
bioriented kinetochore microtubule attachments, and for the number of rounds of error correction of improper
attachments. The second aim tests the novel hypothesis that cells have a developmentally programmed
mechanism to overcome persistent spindle checkpoint activity in meiosis to ensure the production of gametes.
The third aim analyzes how protein phosphatases counteract kinase activity to specifically ensure kinetochore
assembly and the establishment of kinetochore-microtubule attachments specifically in meiosis II. The
innovative approach of combining the latest imaging technologies to monitor kinetochore-microtubule
attachments in engineered strains allows the testing of novel hypotheses about cell-cycle regulation. The
proposed research is significant because the results are expected to reveal general principles of meiotic
regulation important for proper chromosome segregation. Ultimately, the results will further our understanding
of how errors in meiosis facilitate developmental abnormalities."
10881717,"Alterations in metabolism especially lipogenesis are unique to prostate cancer progression and the changes
from benign to malignant prostate epithelium involves a switch from mitochondrial oxidative metabolism to
generate energy needs for cellular processes to aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells. This process is critical for
cell proliferation and new cell membrane synthesis including the continued proliferation driven by the androgen
receptor in most castration resistant prostate cancers (CRPC). Mechanisms driving these metabolic alterations
are not fully understood but the endogenous increase in endogenous lipogenesis by fatty acid synthase
(FASN), an androgen receptor driven gene, and a decrease in 5’AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) activity are
crucial components of the altered metabolic processes driving CRPC. In our Preliminary Data we demonstrate
that alteration in function of these two genes, inhibition of FASN and activation of AMPK, by two new drugs will
suppress growth of enzalutamide castrate resistant tumors in vitro and in vivo. We have shown that alteration
in metabolism will suppress the growth of tumors driven by AR constitutively active variants that were the basis
of my current VA Merit Review. The hypothesis of this project is that targeting activation of AMPK
suppresses PCa proliferation by regulating lipogenesis with subsequent inhibition of AR expression and
activity. In order to address this hypothesis we will first demonstrate expression of AMPK, AMPK-related
subunits (e.g., phospho serine 486, p-acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase), and FASN in tissue microarrays (TMA)
of primary prostate cancer, metastatic CRPC tumors, and prostate cancer patient-derived (PDX) models, and
determine correlation with AR, AR-V7, and AR-variants. We have previously shown a strong correlation
between FASN expression and AR in CRPC in metastatic prostate cancer. In addition, other studies have
shown activated AMPK levels decrease in progression from primary to metastatic prostate cancer and for
primary PCa, this may be predictive of development of metastatic disease. Therefore, we will examine use the
extensive patient material available in the University of Washington/Fred Hutchison prostate cancer program to
determine clinical expression of these cancer progression factors. Next we will determine the mechanism by
which AMPK is activated by BKI 1553 and affects AR transcriptional output. Our preliminary data indicates that
activation of AMPK by the dephosphorylation of Ser486 suppresses growth of AR-driven CRPC. Further, this
activity is activated by BKI 1553 but only in PCa cells that are AR positive. In this aim we will determine the
MOA of BKI 1553 activation of AMPK, potential target(s) and its subsequent mechanism of suppression of AR
expression and transcriptional activity. Next we will assess if antiproliferative actions of BKI 1553 include
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of enzymes in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUSFAs)
metabolism. Finally, demonstrate in vivo activity of AMPK activation and FASN inhibition on CRPC. We will
expand to PCa PDX models identified in Aim 1 where FASN and/or AMPK expression has changed in
progression to CRPC in order to better show the applicability of BKI 1553 and IP1991 to a range of CRPCs."
10915678,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Zambia is a global epicenter for HIV with a large number of adolescents and young adults living with HIV
(AYAHIV). Compared with their uninfected peers, AYAHIV are at increased risk of developing cancer, most
frequently Kaposi sarcoma (KS), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), and cervical cancer (CC). To reduce this
premature mortality, evidence-based strategies should be implemented to both diagnose cancers at an
earlier stage and help AYAHIV complete recommended cancer treatment. We will use theory-informed
multilevel strategies to create the AYAHIV Role-based Responsibilities for Oncology-focused Workforce
(ARROW) program to increase uptake of services for early diagnosis and improve compliance with cancer
treatment for KS, NHL, and CC. Our overall approach is based on the evidence-based strategy of peer
support for engagement and learning. At the individual level, we will address barriers by embedding peer
counselors to support AYAHIV. At the provider level, we will create a peer-to-peer learning network to build
linkages between those specializing in pediatric and adult HIV treatment and cancer care. At the health care
system level, we will bring together health care administrators and Zambian Ministry of Health policy makers
to review barriers and to develop and implement collaborative solutions. We will use implementation science
methods to evaluate effectiveness, implementation outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of the ARROW
program compared with a one-time education campaign by pursuing the following aims:
Aim 1. Conduct randomized trials to compare the ARROW program with the one-time education campaign in
increasing services received by AYAHIV to facilitate early diagnosis (physical exam for KS and NHL, CC
screening, and timely diagnostic testing) and in improving adherence to cancer treatment.
Aim 2. Use mixed methods to assess implementation outcomes of the ARROW program compared with one-
time education based on acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, fidelity, and sustainability.
Aim 3. Perform economic evaluations to assess cost-effectiveness and return-on-investment scenarios.
Successful completion of these aims will yield a set of data-driven strategies that can be scaled up to reduce
premature cancer mortality among AYAHIV. To support future implementation efforts, we will generate
incremental cost-effectiveness estimates, conduct policy simulations, evaluate implementation outcomes,
and assess challenges and facilitators to optimize the ARROW program. The model tested in Zambia can
serve as a blueprint for other Sub-Saharan African countries to ensure AYAHIV receive optimal services to
facilitate early diagnosis and ensure completion of guideline-recommended treatments. The ARROW
program will also provide a framework for implementing expanded services, such as preventive services and
survivorship care, to further reduce the burden of cancer AYAHIV face."
10878019,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Problem: The long-term outcome of tissues regenerated with stem cell-based therapies requires functional
vascularization and enervation and a microenvironment that is supportive of the maintenance of undifferentiated
stem cells. In the 1st funding cycle of this project, we demonstrated that neural crest-derived dental pulp stem
cells (DPSC) can differentiate into vascular endothelial cells. In the 2nd cycle, we showed that DPSC-derived
vessels mature upon investment by mural cells and anastomize with host vasculature to become fully functional
blood vessels. During these studies, we observed that a sub-population of DPSCs functions as neural progenitor
cells and differentiate into neural cells while other DPSCs remain undifferentiated via stem cell self-renewal.
Collectively, these tightly modulated events enable the generation of neurovascular stem cell niches in tissues
regenerated with DPSC. However, mechanisms underpinning the generation and maintenance of these niches
are unclear. Therefore, our ability to engage the full potential of DPSCs in tissue regeneration is limited. Premise:
It is known that Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is critical for neurogenic differentiation of progenitor
cells in the central nervous system (CNS) during embryonic development. In contrast, N-Cadherin was shown
to maintain neural progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state in the CNS. Here, we will determine what is the
role of these two signaling pathways in the balance between self-renewal (i.e. maintenance of stemness) and
neurogenic differentiation of neural progenitor cells in the peripheral nervous system using DPSC as a prototypic
mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) population. Further, using single cell RNA sequencing we found that untreated
DPSCs are heterogeneous exhibiting 8 unique cell clusters. Here, we propose studies to understand how DPSC
heterogeneity and plasticity impacts the generation and maintenance of neurovascular stem cell niches in the
pulp. Our overall hypothesis is: “a balance between BDNF-induced neurogenic differentiation and N-Cadherin-
induced self-renewal of neural progenitor cells enables the generation and maintenance of DPSC-derived
neurovascular stem cell niches”. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims: S.A.#1: To define the role
of autocrine BDNF on the neurogenic differentiation of DPSC; S.A.#2: To define the role of N-Cadherin signaling
on the maintenance of neural progenitor cells in DPSC-derived neurovascular stem cell niches; S.A.#3: To define
the function of DPSC heterogeneity and plasticity on the generation and maintenance of neurovascular stem cell
niches. Significance: Successful completion of this work will unveil mechanisms that orchestrate the generation
of neurovascular stem cell niches. These niches create a microenvironment that supports the maintenance of
undifferentiated stem cells that can be activated for replacement of dead terminally differentiated cells (e.g.
odontoblasts, neural cells). Understanding processes underpinning the formation and maintenance of
neurovascular stem cell niches will enable novel mechanism-based regenerative therapies and inspire new
approaches to enhance the long-term outcome of tissues regenerated with dental pulp stem cells."

Attention deficits cause life-long challenges affecting academic and job performance, social relationships, and
life satisfaction. Attention problems typically begin at an early age and children with attention problems struggle
in school. Ideally, attention deficits would be identified before a child enters school. A primary limitation in the
field is our limited knowledge of the neural signatures of attention in young children. Children with prenatal
alcohol exposure (PAE) and children with a diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) related to PAE
experience persistent attention deficits, and PAE is present at birth. Therefore, studying children with and
without PAE provides us with an opportunity to examine neural signatures of attention at a young age in a
group of children at high risk of attention deficits. Children raised in lower socioeconomic households are also
at greater risk of attention problems, and due to high rates of poverty in New Mexico, we are well-positioned to
examine its role in attention in children with and without PAE. Research in adults indicates that alpha
oscillations play a key role in directing attention, but it is unknown how alpha oscillations are related to
attention early in development. Alpha oscillations are easily elicited during rest, modified during tasks, and
measurable across development. This study builds on (1) prior research demonstrating thalamus drives some
cortical alpha oscillations whereas others are driven by cortico-cortical connections or local network dynamics
and (2) studies in preclinical PAE models and research in children with PAE indicating disrupted cortico-
thalamic and cortico-cortical tracts with PAE. Aim 1 will establish the role of alpha oscillations and cortico-
thalamic or cortico-cortical connectivity in attention by measuring alpha oscillations during rest and task using
magnetoencephalography (MEG) and white matter integrity (WMI) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in
typically developing children aged 4-7 years. Aim 2 will assess alterations in alpha oscillations and WMI and
their relation to attention deficits in children with PAE, relative to typically developing children. Aim 3 will
examine the developmental trajectory of alpha oscillations and WMI and their role in attention by following the
same children longitudinally until age seven. We hypothesize that alpha oscillations are directly related to WMI
and attention in typically developing children. Furthermore, alpha oscillations will be reduced in children with
PAE, and these reductions will be related to disruptions in WMI and attention deficits. We expect these effects
to be mediated by poverty in both typically developing children and children with PAE. We will test our
hypotheses by measuring alpha oscillations using MEG during 3 tasks that robustly manipulate alpha
oscillations in parietal cortex, somatomotor regions and the fronto-parietal network and examining how these
oscillations relate to WMI and attention. This study will provide foundational knowledge about the role of alpha
oscillations in attention in young children and may indicate potential biomarkers to improve early diagnosis and
intervention for FASD to inform our understanding of attention deficits broadly."
10871872,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United
States. The discovery and targeting of adaptive immune checkpoints (like PD-1 and CTLA4) has been a boon
to cancer patients. Unfortunately, only a subset of patients will respond and those that do often relapse. In an
attempt to improve the efficacy of adaptive immune targeted therapy, several clinical trials have been proposed
or are underway, exploring the combination of checkpoint blockade with chemotherapy. One rationale for
combination therapy is that chemotherapy induces immunogenic tumor cell death which provides robust
activation of the anti-tumor response by releasing neo-antigens and Damage Associated Molecular Patterns
(DAMPs) that initiate the innate pro-inflammatory response.
 We discovered and characterized a novel innate immune checkpoint utilized by tumor cells to suppress the
immune response during chemotherapy. We found that tumor secreted proteins bind and activate the
macrophage Mer receptor, leading to a reduction in the expression of the key Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) adapter
protein MyD88. In the absence of MyD88, macrophages are no longer able to respond to DAMP/TLR signaling,
effectively preventing the pro-inflammatory response during chemotherapy. This suppressive mechanism is
characteristic of tumors of diverse origins including melanoma, lung, pancreas and breast cancers.
 Our mechanistic studies have identified that ligand-activated macrophage Mer induces ternary complex
formation, increasing the association of Mer, Stat1 and a phosphatase known as PTP1b. This complex
reduces the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Stat1 which leads to a decrease in MyD88
expression. Treating with a PTP1b inhibitor blocks this immune suppressive process and restores DAMP-
mediated activation in vitro and in vivo. Combining PTP1b inhibition with chemotherapy causes ~50%
decrease in tumor growth in multiple murine cancers, including chemotherapy resistant models.
 We hypothesize that by targeting the Mer:PTP1b axis, we may be able to improve the innate, and
subsequent adaptive, immune response during chemotherapy. To test our hypothesis we propose to 1)
determine the regulatory mechanism governing tumor secretion of Mer ligands and whether their expression in
human tumors is predictive of chemotherapy response, 2) identify which forms of chemotherapy yield the most
robust immune activation in combination with PTP1b inhibition and 3) ascertain the effects of
chemotherapy/PTP1b inhibition combination therapy on the adaptive immune response."
10871873,"ABSTRACT
Suboptimal linkage to and retention in HIV prevention and care is prevalent among high risk women who use or
inject drugs in both the US and globally, stemming, in part, from high levels of stigma. In Kazakhstan, increasing
engagement in the HIV care and prevention continuum is a major public health goal, as the number of new HIV
infections doubled from 2010 to 2017 and AIDS-related deaths increased by 32%. Among high risk women who
use drugs in this context, our research has found that ~30% are HIV-infected and that they are less likely to test
and receive care. Numerous studies have documented that experienced, anticipated and internalized stigma,
especially from health care providers (HCP), are key barriers to HIV testing and treatment in global contexts. For
high risk women who use drugs, HIV and associated stigmas, specifically stigma related to sex and drug use,
as well as gender discrimination, work independently and synergistically to inhibit access to HIV prevention and
treatment; yet, there are no existing anti-stigma interventions designed and tested in Kazakhstan for this key
population of women and that focus on HCP as sources of stigma. Here we propose to design and assess
acceptability, feasibility, and generate information in order to power a preliminary effectiveness trial of a three
component, multi-level participatory intervention to reduce HIV-associated and intersectional stigma - and thus
increase access to HIV prevention and care. The first component is aimed at high risk women and designed to
increase stigma resistance/coping and reduce anticipated/internalized stigma via: a) crowdsourcing of anti-
stigma messaging for HCP; and b) adaptation of a HCP training for optimal sexual health and healthcare
engagement among high risk women who used drugs. The second and third components, aimed at the HCP
and other clinic staff and emerging from the execution of the first component, include: a) the resultant messaging
campaign; and b) the training that will be delivered to HCP. Both the messaging campaign and the training
components will be designed to reduce enacted stigma by HCP/staff (and thus experienced stigma among
women) and increase stigma resistance and resilience among high risk women who use drugs. All components
will work synergistically to reduce enacted, experienced and internalized, intersectional stigma. The approach
relies on evidence-based methods, including media campaigns, to reduce HCP enacted stigma, and integrates
innovative methods, like crowdsourcing and participatory research, to increase stigma resistance. Results of this
study will be unique in utilizing multilevel anti-stigma approaches for both high risk women who use drugs and
HCP and have important implications for advancing HIV prevention and care engagement among highly
stigmatized populations globally and in the US."

10872187,"The Research Development Core of the Oklahoma Nathan Shock Center is an innovative departure from the
traditional structure of similar cores in Nathan Shock Centers. Research Development Cores generally support
a limited number of junior faculty members (2-4) within the academic institution using a fixed monetary pilot
award (e.g. $25,000-50,000). The Development Core of the Oklahoma Nathan Shock Center is designed to
provide unprecedented service and outreach to the scientific community. Our goal during the previous funding
period was to increase a) the number of investigators across the country that conduct research in aging by
providing funded access to a series of highly relevant and specialized technologies not often present within an
individual laboratory, and b) educational, mentoring, and collaborative resources that aide in the development
of, and/or transition to, an independent career in the biology of aging and age-related disease (geroscience).
These goals, originally developed by our center have been highly successful, and have been adopted by, and
are now the standard for, all Nathan Shock Centers. Three goals are proposed for the Research Development
Core: Aim 1. Support pilot/feasibility projects for young investigators interested in conducting research in the
biology of aging; a. investigators outside of Oklahoma will be supported through the Nathan Shock Center, and
b. investigators inside of Oklahoma will be supported, in large part, through local funding sources. Aim 2. Provide
collaborative opportunities for mid-level and senior investigators with interests in Geroscience e.g. investigators
with experience in diseases associated with aging but with limited experience in conducting aging research. Aim
3.a. Disseminate novel technologies to the aging community b. Train researchers in best practices, and c.
Evaluate strengths and weaknesses of the Research Development Core. The goals of the Development Core
are highly leveraged using resources available to us from the Center for GeroScience, OUHSC/OMRF/VAMC

promote/publicize the services of the Research Cores as well as evaluate their performance. The Program
Enhancement Core will also administer two novel programs: an annual Oklahoma GeroScience Symposium
and the Geropatholgy Research Resource. The specific aims of the Program Enhancement Core are:
 Aim 1. To provide administrative/management support for the Center. The Core will be responsible for the
day-to-day management of the center; will oversee budgets, including cost recovery for the Research Cores;
and will promote the integration of services among the Research Cores. In addition, the Program Enrichment
Core will evaluate the progress or the Center in two ways: an Internal Advisory Committee consisting of
administrators and research leaders at the three host institutions that will annually evaluate the Center and the
External Advisory Committee consisting of five leaders in aging who will evaluate the Center every other year .
 Aim 2. To promote/publicize services and activities provided by the Cores. The Core will be responsible for
making the scientific community aware of services provided by the Research Cores through a series of
mechanisms, e.g., a website, the Shock Centers Coordinating Center with the American Federation for Aging
Research, and Core Leaders attending aging meetings such as the Gordon and Keystone Conferences and
the annual meetings of the American Aging Association and Gerontological Society of America.
 Aim 3. To provide the intellectual and organizational leadership to stimulate interest in aging and
geroscience in Oklahoma and the nation. Interest in aging and geroscience in Oklahoma City and Oklahoma
as well as the nation will be stimulated through a variety of activities, e.g., organizing a seminar series in aging
at OUHSC/OMRF, hosting the Summer Training Course in Experimental Aging Research when it is in
Oklahoma City, and participating in the bi-annual Nathan Shock Summits at the annual meeting of the
American Aging Association. Most important will be the annual Oklahoma GeroScience Symposium, which will
be organized and managed by the Program Enhancement Core.
 Aim 4. To provide investigators with pathological analysis specifically designed for studying aging mice
through the Geropathology Research Resource (GRR). The GRR will provide investigators with the unique
geropathological analysis developed by the Geropathology Research Network, which will allow investogators
to evaluate the effect of age and aging interventions on the pathological status of mice. The GRR will also
collaborate with the University of Washington Shock Center to continue the functions of the Geropathology
Research Network and promote the use of the Geropathology Grading Platform to veterinary pathologists."
10872190,"Administrative and Research Services Core (AR): Abstract
The overall goal of the Administrative and Research Services Core (AR) is to promote and support outstanding
population-based research on aging through management of all Center activities and resources. The AR Core
will provide scientific leadership, consult with the Center’s Advisory Committee and Faculty Council to refine
the Center strategic vision, coordinate all center activities, and serve as the communications hub for the Center
(between Center Cores, as well as among CAPS, NIA, and the Coordinating Center). The AR Core will share
administrative resources with the highly successful Population Research Center (PRC) at UT Austin. The
extensive experience and expertise of PRC administrators and staff will be leveraged to efficiently manage, plan,
and coordinate CAPS AR Core support for exceptional population-based research on aging. The Administrative
and Research Support Core has 4 Specific Aims: 1) Refine the Center strategic vision, 2) Build a vibrant,
interdisciplinary community of scholars to advance population-based research on aging, 3) Manage Program
Development and Pilot (PD) Core programs and activities that lead to inventive pilot projects and future NIA
funding, and 4) Provide outstanding administrative and research services to support large-scale funded
research projects that advance population-based research on aging.
To achieve these aims, the AR Core will form an internal Faculty Council and an external Advisory committee to
advise and support the AR Core Director in the refinement of the Center’s strategic vision, programmatic priorities,
and pilot project program. The AR Core will also design and manage activities to build a scientifically stimulating
research culture that fosters collaborations within CAPS, across UT, and with the wider network of Centers on
the Demography and Economics of Aging (e.g., speaker series, conferences and workshops). The AR Core
Director will work with UT leadership to leverage hiring and institutional resources to support and expand
CAPS faculty, and will work closely with the PD Core to design and manage activities to support a successful
pilot project program. The AR Core will manage logistics for all phases of pilot projects (e.g., solicitation, review
procedures, monitoring research compliance, tracking outcomes, meeting reporting requirements) and organize
activities that cultivate pilot development and success indicated by consequential publications, impact on the field,
and NIA grant submissions. The AR Core will provide comprehensive administrative services to facilitate
successful scale-up of CAPS pilot projects to the next level of funded research and support all large-scale
research projects of CAPS faculty. Sharing resources with the Administrative and Scientific and Technical
Cores of the Population Research Center (PRC) significantly enhances the AR Core’s capacity to provide
outstanding administrative and research services to the new Center on Aging and Population Sciences at UT
Austin."
10872191,"The goal of the Genomic Sciences Core (GSC) is to provide researchers in aging and geroscience across
the country with access to state-of-the-art genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic analyses targeted to biology
of aging research questions and that are not typically provided by institutional cores. Specifically, the GSC will
offer services in the analysis of mitochondrial genomes, DNA modifications (methylation/hydroxymethylation),
and single-cell transcriptomics. In coordination with the GeroInformatics Core, these services will take
investigator-submitted samples from data generation to analysis and interpretation. In the previous cycle, our
epigenomic and mitochondrial genomic services were widely used and will continue to be offered. New services
will integrate whole genome epigenomic analyses, differentiation of methylation from hydroxymethylation and a
suite of single cell RNA-Seq services. The rationale for focusing services in these areas are: 1) Accumulation of
mitochondrial DNA mutations/deletions and copy number changes are a central mechanistic hypothesis in
mitochondrial dysfunction with aging. 2) Epigenetic mechanisms are a conserved, and potentially causative,
factor in aging. Growing evidence demonstrates that not only does the epigenome change with aging, but anti-
aging interventions can prevent age-related changes to the epigenome. 3) Modern molecular biology has opened
a new door to understand cellular heterogeneity a research area at the heart of current geroscience research
(e.g., cellular senescence). Single-cell transcriptomic approaches move past bulk RNA-Seq of whole tissues to
individual cell types and sub-types. Central to the design of the GSC services are bioinformatic workflows to take
investigators from sample to fully analyzed data. The GSC will have three aims: 1) Perform quantitatively precise
DNA modification analyses, ranging from genome-wide to gene-specific using advanced epigenetic
technologies, 2) Measure mitochondrial genome heteroplasmy and copy number for comprehensive variant
analysis and absolute quantitation, and 3) Single-cell transcriptomics for analysis of cellular heterogeneity. GSC
services are designed such that aging research investigators can take advantage of specific analyses or whole
workflows as meets their experimental needs, and almost all services can be performed on stored nucleic
acids/cells. The Genomic Sciences Core has developed a set of tools highly relevant to aging research that are
not widely available to investigators, either in their own laboratories or through institutional core facilities, both in
terms of instrumentation and expertise, meeting a need for a resource provider in the field. Furthermore, the
interaction with the GeroInformatics Core provides a workflow where not only can geroscience investigators from
across the country have data generated by the GSC but it is analyzed into an investigator-usable form."
10872192,"Program Development and Pilot Core (PD): Abstract
The overall goal of the Program Development and Pilot Core (PD) is to promote innovative research to offer
new insights critical to furthering the health and well-being of an aging and diverse US population. The
Program Development and Pilot Core (PD) will be charged with guiding and nurturing the development of the
Center’s research program and pilot project portfolio relevant to the Center’s three thematic research areas: 1)
Life-course precursors of advantage and disadvantage at older ages, 2) Family demography, social
engagement, and social isolation, and 3) Place, aging, and health. The PD Core has 3 Specific Aims: 1) Foster
the development of innovative pilot project ideas and proposals, 2) Provide programs and activities to ensure
pilot project productivity and success, and 3) Ramp up inventive pilot project results to develop larger projects
that advance the field.
Activities to foster innovative pilot ideas and high caliber pilot proposals include large conferences focused on
issues at the forefront of NIA research priorities; focused workshops concentrating on conceptual innovations,
state-of-the-art methods, and novel and rich data sources; and pilot proposal development sessions. Pilot
projects will focus on research questions central to NIA strategic priorities and CAPS research themes to
illuminate how exposures and experiences throughout life influence diversity in aging and health. Activities to
ensure pilot success include benchmark monitoring and response plans, administrative and research services
to support pilot research, and assignment of a faculty mentor to early-career investigators. Pilot projects will be
selected based on their potential to advance scholarship on aging and lead to a larger project and NIA grant
submissions. The transition from pilot to larger research projects and the preparation of grant submissions
based on pilot results will be supported by a Grant Writing Bootcamp to train new investigators in
grantsmanship and by mock NIA-review sessions via the Workshop that Grant program for both established
and new investigators. The PD Core will work closely with the AR Core to develop and deliver programs and
activities to ensure pilot project development and success, including high-impact publications and NIA grant
submissions for larger studies based on pilot projects. The ability to achieve these goals is greatly enhanced by
the shared resources and vibrant community of population scientists associated with UT Austin’s nationally-
recognized Population Research Center (PRC); the PRC has extensive experience in managing pilot programs
and activities, as well as in the preparation and submission of large research project proposals."
10872196,"The goal of the Multiplexing Protein Analysis Core (MPAC) is to provide users with specialized tools to
determine the dynamic regulation of the proteome. As in the previous cycle, our primary service includes the
rigorous, sensitive and precise quantification of panels of proteins relevant to the basic biology of aging and
age-related disease. For this cycle, we expand the capabilities of the core by adding stable isotope tracer
experiments with deuterium oxide (D2O) to measure the turnover of proteins. Although core facilities that offer
discovery-based proteomics are relatively common, only a few cores offer these targeted methods. Further, the
Core offers these assays in panels that interrogate specific biochemical pathways important in aging and can
design new assays and panels on request for any protein from any animal with a sequenced genome. In
addition, the Core can use its targeted approaches for post-translational modifications such as
phosphorylation. There are also relatively few laboratories with the expertise to measure protein turnover rates
using stable isotopes. Measuring synthetic rates with tracers requires proper study design, mass spectrometry
with appropriate sample preparation and analysis, and correct interpretation of data. The advantages of D2O
for Core users are significant. Specifically, it is cheap, highly sensitive, flexible, biologically inert, lends itself to
long-term labeling, and can be used to measure the synthesis of a variety of molecules. The combination of
D2O labeling and targeted proteomics in one sample allows users to understand changes in the content of
individual proteins, the turnover processes that drive the changes, and mechanisms such as cell proliferation
and ribosomal biogenesis that contribute to these changes. Finally, the analyses provided by the core are
made on frozen samples, facilitating ease of sample collection for outside users. The Core proposes two
specific aims: 1) Develop and apply high throughput multiplexed protein quantification for panels of proteins,
including post-translational modifications, in experimental systems used by Geroscience investigators,
including mice, rats, fruit flies, C.elegans, and yeast, and 2) Use stable isotope labeling and analysis in
combination with multiplexed protein quantification to measure turnover of individual proteins as well as
processes that contribute to the regulation of protein abundance. To accomplish the aims, the MPA Core uses
selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) in tandem mass spectrometry
systems or high-resolution accurate mass (HRAM) selected ion monitoring (SIM) in an orbitrap mass
spectrometry system, as well as GC-MS based analysis of supportive measurements. The ability to adapt
these procedures to multiple cell types, tissues, and model organisms make the MPA Core a significant
resource for the aging research community."
10872311,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cells must organize their contents spatially and temporally. The microtubule cytoskeleton and its associated
molecular motors, dynein and kinesin, are the main system used by cells to move cargos, ranging from protein
assemblies to entire organelles, including the nucleus. Dynein (~0.5MDa) is a member of the AAA+ family. Active
dynein complexes, the only ones capable of transporting cargo, are ~4MDa and consist of two dynein dimers
bound to the ~1.0MDa dynactin complex, and an adaptor protein that links them to cargo. Lis1, another
essential regulator of dynein, is necessary for their formation. Previously, we showed how Lis1 regulates
dynein’s mechanochemistry. Here, we will focus on understanding how the 90kDa Lis1 dimer helps activate
and assemble the 4MDa transport complex.
 Chromatin, with the nucleosome as its basic unit, provides both a solution to the problem of packaging
the genome, and a tool to regulate access to it. Among the factors involved in controlling chromatin dynamics
are ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelers, which couple ATP hydrolysis to the non-covalent modification of
nucleosome structure. Both remodelers and the modifications they catalyze are very diverse, even though all
remodelers use the same mechanism, and conserved catalytic core, to break histone-DNA contacts. I am
interested in how this common underlying mechanism is modulated to result in the wide array of
outcomes of which remodelers are capable. Previously, we focused on model systems representing two of
the four families of “canonical” remodelers. Here, we will focus on Rad26 (the yeast ortholog of CSB), an “orphan”
remodeler that uses its remodeling-like activity to act on RNA Pol II to help it overcome obstacles or initiate
Transcription Coupled DNA Repair (TCR) when the obstacle is a DNA lesion. We aim to understand how
Rad26 helps RNA Pol II recognize a lesion from other obstacles and recruit downstream repair factors.
 We take a structure-guided approach to addressing fundamental mechanistic questions, with cryo-
electron microscopy (cryo-EM) as our main technique. We use the structures we generate to formulate
mechanistic hypotheses that can be tested, either in house or in collaboration, using a range of techniques
including single-molecule biophysics, biochemistry, and cell biology. We have made major contributions to our
understanding of the mechanochemical cycle of dynein and its regulation, and to the functional diversity and
regulation of nucleosome remodelers. We are also interested in developing tools to solve challenges we
encounter along the cryo-EM pipeline and have made important contributions to cryo-EM grid preparation and
data processing in the cloud. We are currently developing approaches to increase the efficiency of data
collection."
10869841,"PROJECT SUMMARY
TOGA-DKD is a pilot/feasibility study of the use of hospitalization as an opportunity to identify patients
with high-risk diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and link them to a pharmacist-led transition of care (TOC)
program to ensure access to guidelines-based medications post-discharge. Kidney disease affects up
to 37 million Americans, 800,000 of whom have end stage kidney disease (ESKD). DKD is the leading
cause of ESKD, is a major risk for mortality and disproportionately affects racial-ethnic minorities. New
therapies have revolutionized treatment of DKD and adherence to updated guidelines can save lives.
However, implantation challenges prevent adherence to guidelines in those patients that need them the
most, patients like ones served by Montefiore Health System. Frequent hospitalizations and a
fragmented healthcare delivery system that enables clinical inertia, both of which are worsened by
unmet social needs, exacerbate DKD progression in minoritized populations. Transitions between
hospital and discharge site, and patients and their community networks, are far from seamless,
rendering patient self-management and adherence to guideline-recommended care challenging.
Pharmacists have the necessary skillset to overcome these challenges because of their ability to
interface with patients, navigate complicated formulary requirements, titrate medications according to
clinical findings, and coordinate care with health care providers. Hospitalization presents an opportunity
for pharmacists to implement initiation of these medications while providing transition of care coaching.
This study will test the feasibility of adapting a transition of care program already embedded in the
institutional mission to reduce readmissions among heart failure patients, to meet the population health
goal of reducing kidney disease progression. An essential component of the pharmacist intervention is
determination of social needs of patients, a necessary part of any effort to reduce health disparities,
using the validated Montefiore Social Needs Screener. We will test recruitment feasibility of 100 patients
by 2-3 pharmacists within 7 months, because this is a pilot study to inform a large multicenter
randomized controlled trial that tests the effectiveness of TOGA-DKD to improve adherence and reduce
DKD progression. Process outcomes testing will help determine best workflow strategies of the
pharmacist and coordination efforts among multiple ambulatory disciplines for the larger study. Rate of
completion and positive responses to the Montefiore social needs screener will support its use in the
TOC process, and any successful linkage to social services or community resources will show feasibility
of this approach to impact on those needs. Exploratory outcomes will give insight into sustainability of
intervention at 30 days post-discharge which will inform a longitudinal program component of the future
larger intervention.
The study team and study advisory board are institutional stakeholders, leaders, and experienced
investigators at the forefront of health delivery innovation, sparked by the unique needs of the patient
population served and accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Montefiore is a Learning Health System
and serves a predominantly underserved racial/ethnic minority population at disproportionate risk of
kidney disease. Research findings will be disseminated to policymakers, health system administrators,
the scientific community, and patients. TOGA-DKD will lay the foundation for the implementation,
scalability and health delivery redesign for those populations who struggle with complex comorbidity
and unfavorable social circumstances."
10869035,"Project Summary
Depression affects 1-in-5 individuals in the United States and has a tremendous cost burden for our economy
at $210 billion per year. Depression is hard to treat given that it is a heterogeneous illness associated with
affective, cognitive and behavioral dysregulation. Around 33% of depressed individuals will not respond to the
first two treatments offered. In this context, there is increasing evidence that cognitive functioning in major
depression may be an independent factor predicting treatment response, quality of life, disability and suicide,
and cognitive control (CC) deficits may persist even when other depression symptoms remit. For instance,
FDA-approved therapies for treatment-resistant-depression (TRD) such as repetitive transcranial magnetic
stimulation (rTMS) target the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) brain region that is crucial for CC. But
rTMS studies show remission rates of only ~30%, and there is no evidence that rTMS for depression improves
CC. This suggests that for individuals with TRD, synergistically targeting CC alongside treatments like rTMS
may augment depression treatment response, improve quality of life and potentially reduce morbidity and
mortality. While multiple options may exist for targeting CC, based on our preliminary evidence, here we
propose to use a digital breath-focused attention training paradigm paired with DLPFC rTMS. We hypothesize
that this multimodal neurotherapy will significantly improve CC, and result in better antidepressant treatment
response than observed with extant rTMS treatment, particularly by engaging the neural target of default mode
network (DMN) activity suppression.
Our rationale for pairing digital breath attention training with rTMS is that mindfulness-based interventions that
have a core foundation in training attention to internal sensations such as breathing, can improve CC and also
ameliorate ruminative symptoms of depression. Digital training, compared to therapist delivered, allows for
greater scalability, immediate feedback on performance and application of algorithmic closed-loop training
methods tailored to each subject’s performance. From a cognitive neuroscience viewpoint, the CC deficits that
occur in depression are linked with impaired top-down control of DMN activity. Both DLPFC rTMS and
mindfulness training are hypothesized to work, in part, by enhancing efficacy of top-down/prefrontal
suppression of DMN, suggesting potential synergy of these distinct approaches. We therefore hypothesize that
our multimodal neurotherapeutic strategy of pairing a digital breath attention training that is akin to mindfulness
training, with rTMS will result in improved CC, as well as enhanced antidepressant effects. The R61 phase of
the project will focus on dose response of the multimodal therapy for neural target engagement, i.e. DMN
activity suppression, while the R33 phase will replicate neural target engagement and also aim to show
improvement in CC and greater depressive symptom response to treatment in a randomized controlled trial."
10865865,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly those blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, have improved
the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), supporting the premise that evasion of immune
destruction contributes to NSCLC pathogenesis. Nonetheless, NSCLCs with EGFR mutations often exhibit
intrinsic or acquired resistance to ICIs, emphasizing a critical need for defining the mechanisms that drive
immune evasion and developing agents to circumvent them.
 Work in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) has demonstrated that EGFR mutant NSCLC
cells activate the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and increase production of proinflammatory cytokines that suppress T
cell activity in the tumor microenvironment (TME). As a mechanistic basis for those findings, we found that the
oncogenic MUC1-C protein, which is of importance for NSCLC progression, contributes to induction of PD-L1
expression and a program of immune suppression.
 Other studies showed that targeting MUC1-C in immunocompetent NSCLC tumor models reverses the
suppression of immune recognition and destruction. These findings have collectively supported the premise
that MUC1-C contributes to an immunosuppressive NSCLC TME and is a potential target for advancing
NSCLC treatment. Accordingly, we generated novel antibodies against the non-shed MUC1-C extracellular
domain that are under development as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs).
 What is needed now, at least in part, is to more precisely define how MUC1-C promotes immune evasion to
advance the immunotherapy of EGFR mutant NSCLCs and to determine whether targeting MUC1-C is
effective in reversing immune suppression and resistance to ICIs in NSCLC treatment. The aim of this
proposal is to identify novel therapeutic strategies using anti-MUC1-C ADCs alone and in combination with
ICIs that restrain the progression of NSCLC through activating anti-tumor immunity.
 Our overall hypothesis is that MUC1-C plays an important role in immune evasion of EGFR mutant
NSCLCs, which will be addressed in studies of (i) human NSCLC cell lines, (ii) GEMMs, and (iii) NSCLC tumor
specimens. The objective of the proposed work is to advance our understanding of how MUC1-C activates
immunosuppressive pathways in EGFR mutant NSCLC by targeting MUC1-C with ADCs that, based on our
preliminary findings, could provide new opportunities for improving NSCLC immunotherapy."

neurodevelopment in children. In this proposal, I will acquire training, knowledge, and skills in career
development, toxicology, advanced statistics, and growth/metabolism to transition into an independent
transdisciplinary investigator and become a leader in pediatric environmental health. I have assembled an
expert team of mentors and collaborators with transdisciplinary expertise in exposomics, neurodevelopmental

executive function development; 2) Dania Valvi, MD, Ph.D., MPH, in phthalates toxicity, epidemiology and
obesity development in children; 3) Shelley Liu, Ph.D., in statistical methods to assess mixtures and novel
statistical approaches for neurodevelopmental tests including advanced latent variable modeling and
longitudinal statistical applications; 4) Deborah Cory-Slechta, Ph.D., in neurotoxicology and interpretation of
operant testing assessment; and 5) Syam Andra, Ph.D. in toxicology and analytical chemistry. This research
proposal will integrate concepts of toxicology, growth/metabolism, eating behaviors, brain development, critical
windows, and advanced statistical applications for chemical mixtures, using BMI trajectory data and measures
of inhibitory control and reward processing assessed as mediators in a longitudinal study, estimating the total,
direct, and indirect (i.e., causal mediation) effects of phthalates. The proposed research and training plan will
position me to achieve my long-term goal of identifying and evaluating neurotoxic exposures that longitudinally
influence child health and neurodevelopment among minority children and adolescents. I will use this K99/R00
as a foundation for a future R01 grant and the transition to a tenure-track independent investigator aimed to
understand these complex inter-relationships."

Exposure to outdoor air pollution (AP) is a risk factor for “accelerated” aging and Alzheimer’s disease, but very
few studies have used neuroimaging to define the mechanistic underpinnings of these relationships. Existing
studies are further limited by the confluence of biopsychosocial factors that have been shown to modify systemic
health consequences of air pollution but have not been modeled in studies of the brain. Finally, the lack of
geospatial diversity in existing studies of air pollution and aging brain health raises numerous questions about
the generalizability of existing neuroimaging findings that predominantly come from high-income countries with
“low” annual levels of exposure. This proposal is designed to address these challenges and limitations through
a new environmental working group within the ENIGMA consortium – ENIGMA-Environment – consisting of 46
individual cohorts from 21 countries. In this proposal we leverage unprecedented geospatial diversity to 1.

white matter trajectories across the lifespan. Outcomes will provide the first translatable model of AP
neurotoxicity in the context of BPS variables, providing a transformative framework for enhanced
detection of individuals at risk for “accelerated” brain aging and AD."
10867721,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lipid metabolism, including lipid synthesis and degradation, is essential for the immune system and cellular
functions. Lipid droplets (LDs) are major lipid storage organelles that modulate macrophage function and are a
potential therapeutic target. The molecular mechanisms that link LDs and macrophage functions are still poorly
understood. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease in which efferocytosis, or clearance
of apoptotic cells, by macrophages is impaired. Current medications for SLE rely on nonspecific
immunosuppressive drugs with severe toxicities, and new targeted approaches are necessary. Two ancient
innate molecules, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and C1q, have unique features in SLE. In humans, C1q
deficiency is highly associated with SLE. Conversely, HMGB1, which functions to block efferocytosis, is
significantly elevated in the serum of approximately one third of patients with SLE. We identified an interaction
between C1q and HMGB1, demonstrating that exposure to both proteins polarizes monocytes to an anti-
inflammatory (M2-like) phenotype. We also showed that exposure to HMGB1 plus C1q enhances LD quantity in
M2-like macrophages compared with macrophages exposed to HMGB1 alone, which exhibit an M1-like
phenotype. We replicated our findings in alternatively activated (M2) macrophages differentiated from human
monocytes. The M2 macrophages had significantly more LDs than classically activated (M1) macrophages. In
addition, M2 and M2-like macrophages showed better engulfment of apoptotic cells than M1 and M1-like
macrophages. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that LDs carrying specific lipids and proteins in
M2 and M2-like macrophages support efferocytosis function in response to exposure to apoptotic cells. In this
proposal, we describe experiments to (i) characterize LDs in macrophage subsets, and (ii) determine if we can
change macrophage functionality by manipulating the content of LDs. In Aim 1, we will characterize LDs using
biochemical and histologic approaches based on quantitative mass spectrometry, lipidomics, proteomics, and
high-resolution imaging. In Aim 2, we will define how LDs from M2 macrophages are associated with
efferocytosis and determine if targeted LD modulation either in quantity or composition can shift macrophage
function. Collectively, we expect this work to uncover the connection between LDs and macrophage function and
to reveal a mechanism by which HMGB1 and C1q promote immune tolerance in macrophages. If our hypotheses
are correct, we will continue these studies to help pinpoint new therapeutic targets in SLE based on the
manipulation of LDs and macrophage function."

Chemoenzymatic construction of synthetic human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) glycome
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) constitute a major component of human milk which provides everything
that breast-fed infants need in the first several months of their lives. There is an increasing appreciation of the
multifaceted contribution of HMOs to the health of breast-fed infants. Exploring the applications of HMOs as
infant formula additives, nutraceuticals, and/or therapeutics has begun but has been slow due to the limited
access to structurally defined HMOs in sufficient amounts. The structures of more than 150 HMOs are known.
Despite efforts and advances in developing chemical, enzymatic, chemoenzymatic, and fermentation methods
for HMO synthesis, the access to a complete HMO glycome has not been achieved synthetically. HMOs can be
purified from human milk but the amount is limited. We plan to lower the technical barrier to access HMOs by
developing highly efficient user-friendly glycosyltransferase-based chemoenzymatic methods and construct a
comprehensive synthetic HMO glycome. Other than the enzymes, the chemoenzymatic synthetic strategies, and
the production processes that have been developed, additional innovation will be introduced for substrate and
process engineering. New enzymes will be identified, engineered, characterized, and used for the synthesis of
HMOs in a systematic target-oriented manner. Maps for chemoenzymatic synthetic routes will be developed. A
comprehensive library of HMOs including branched and long-chain linear structures with or without L-fucose
and/or sialic acid that have been identified from human milk and potential isomers that have not been identified
will be constructed. The synthetic HMO glycome will provide well characterized pure compound standards for
identifying and profiling of HMOs in the milk from different nursing mothers, at different lactation stages, and with
or without infections or other diseases. The chemoenzymatic synthetic process is programmable, can be adapted
for automation, and is readily scalable for large-scale production of HMOs in the future."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is an incalcitrant malignancy with a 5-year survival of only 10%.
Therefore, targeting PDA precursors is an area of the highest priority. Amongst the most prevalent and easily
identifiable high-risk individuals with PDA precursors are patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm
(IPMN). Currently, patients with IPMN are managed with active surveillance (AS) and surgery to develop high-
risk stigmata. FDA-approved non-operative treatment of IPMN to prevent progression to PDA does not exist.
Challenges to developing an effective IPMN agent include identifying agents that can be tested in human
clinical trials, availability of an appropriate group of high-risk patients that can be entered into a clinical
prevention trial, and identifying potential biomarkers that could predict the efficacy of chemoprevention agents.
Recent work from our team has identified δ-tocotrienol (DT3) as a novel apoptosis-inducing agent for IPMN,
MUC4 as a driver as well as a predictive biomarker of IPMN progression, and an ideal cohort of motivated
patients with IPMN on AS, that provides new opportunities to address each of these high-priority challenges. In
a recently completed NCI-sponsored Phase I window-of-opportunity trial, we observed that DT3 is safe and
significantly induces apoptosis in the neoplastic cells of patients with IPMN. Our preliminary studies also
suggest that MUC4 expression is associated with response to DT3. Further, we observed that MUC4
expression in the background of oncogenic KRAS results in the development of IPMN in mouse pancreas.
Thus, the overall hypothesis for this proposal is that DT3 will block IPMN progression by targeting
pathways that are crucial for the initiation, maintenance, and progression of IPMN precursor lesions.
This hypothesis will be tested in two aims: In Aim 1, we will conduct a Phase II multi-institutional, randomized,
placebo-controlled trial of DT3 in the prevention of IPMN progression (106 patients/arm) utilizing individuals
from Moffitt Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Mayo Clinic. The primary endpoint will
be IPMN Progression-Free Survival based on international guidelines criteria after three years. Patients will be
monitored with MRI/MRCP and endoscopic ultrasound-based on a standard of care. Further, correlative
studies will utilize radiomics and tissue and serum samples to study the biomarkers of response and discern
the mechanism of action of DT3. In Aim 2, we will define the molecular targets of DT3, the mechanism of
biochemical responses, and identify biomarkers of DT3 in the genetically engineered model of IPMN (KC-
MUC4 Tg) that harbors the mutational combination of oncogenic KRAS and inducible MUC4 overexpression.
Insights gained from the studies in Aim 2 will be validated with biospecimens obtained from patients in Aim 1.
This multidisciplinary proposal will allow opportunities to reduce PDA mortality by advancing a
promising noninvasive paradigm for reducing the risk of IPMN progression to PDA and providing novel
insights into the molecular mechanisms contributing to the pro-apoptotic effects of DT3."

Representation of minority groups in biomedical research, including research on alcohol effects and alcohol
use disorders, is low; and individuals who identify as members of underrepresented minority groups (URMs)
pursue such careers at far lower rates than expected considering the demographics of the U.S. This project will
focus on cultivating the interest of undergraduate students in alcohol related research to increase the pool of
diverse applicants pursuing alcohol-related research careers. We have established a partnership between
Duke University (a private, R1 university) and North Carolina Central University (NCCU; a public HBCU). Our
program, entitled Duke-N.C. Central Alcohol Research & Education (D-CARE) will provide educational,
research training, and intensive mentoring for undergraduates from both institutions. D-CARE will: 1) Focus
entirely on undergraduates; 2) Pair laboratories and academic courses from Duke and NCCU to provide
innovative alcohol-related academic and research opportunities to URM students from both institutions; and 3)
Provide a wide range of professional development opportunities and track the progress of participants as they
complete their undergraduate training and move forward into graduate or professional education. A primary
goal of the program will be for students from each institution to study and train with students from the other,
thereby leveraging the distinct strengths of each university. Aim 1 will promote in-depth understanding of the
biomedical, public health, social and cultural impacts of alcohol through didactic training, and engagement with
the Research Triangle alcohol research community by providing a semester-long course focused on alcohol
and its various biological, clinical, and social impacts. This Aim will also establish a rich professional network
through which D-CARE participants will acquire specific skills and guidance toward careers related to alcohol
research. Aim 2 will provide an immersive summer alcohol research experience in Duke and NCCU
laboratories that includes personalized research mentoring, and both group and individualized professional
development education. Aim 3 will provide continuing professional development and mentoring opportunities
for participants, and an empirical evaluation component to document participants' progress toward career
goals and follow their progress beyond their undergraduate experience. The program will continue to support
participants by providing monthly meetings with program mentors throughout the following academic year. In
addition, meetings and resources will be provided to support students' specific research endeavors including
advice on poster construction, presentation planning, graduate school/employment applications, and evolving
career development considerations. The program will also provide specific preparatory advice and support for
participants attending scientific conferences in the academic year following the summer research experience."

Within the colon, early life bacterial colonization events favorably influence host health, but simultaneously
establish a vast reservoir for antimicrobial resistance genes. Bacteroides fragilis represents up to 2.5% of the
human gut microbiota and is often found in neonates within the first month of life. B. fragilis is the leading cause
of anaerobic sepsis and deep tissue infections. While long recognized as an antimicrobial resistance threat, an
increasing number of B. fragilis clinical isolates now express high-level resistance to b-lactam antibiotics
including the carbapenems which are considered agents of last resort. Genetic analysis has revealed two distinct
phylogenetic clades of B. fragilis, termed clade I and clade II. Clade II strains exclusively harbor the cfiA locus
which encodes for metallo-b-lactamase (MBL) activity - an antibiotic resistance enzyme for which no available
inhibitors have yet been defined. We have discovered a novel B. fragilis toxin that is specifically expressed in
clade II isolates, termed Bcf1. Bcf1 appears to play a critical role in interbacterial competition between B. fragilis
isolates, positioning this toxin to enable dominance of clade II strains within the B. fragilis niche, expanding the
reservoir for MBL-encoded resistance. The primary goal of this proposal is to examine the molecular mechanisms
by which Bcf1 facilitates interbacterial competition. Our preliminary data suggest that competition may rely on
the ability of Bcf1 to limit nutrient access within the niche. We will explore this through a series of in vitro and in
vivo studies utilizing engineered bacterial genetic variants to discover the protein(s) targeted by Bcf1 and
evaluate the necessity of Bcf1 in inter-clade competition within the B. fragilis niche in a mouse model of colonic
colonization. These studies will benefit from the use of a novel model of B. fragilis vertical transmission in which
the temporal and genetic determinants of niche colonization and interbacterial competition by B. fragilis can be
evaluated in young mice. Through a comprehensive dissection of the mechanism by which Bcf1 ensures the
success of clade II B. fragilis strains, this study has the potential to illuminate a novel mechanism by which
antibiotic resistance to the potent metallo-b-lactam antibiotics is achieved. By focusing on the ecological niche,
these studies may discern critical early events in niche occupancy that are subject to perturbation, or alternatively
highlight novel probiotic-based strategies by which to re-shape interbacterial competition events mediated by
Bcf1 to selectively reduce the prevalence of clade I MBL-expressing strains within the colonic microbiome.

 Binge drinking of alcohol beverages hinders tissue repair and amplifies the susceptibility to infection. The
prevalence as well as the risks associated with binge drinking poses a significant concern in the United States.
Binge drinking impairs the three key phases of wound healing: inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling.
Specifically, during the inflammation phase, binge drinking diminishes the function of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
neutrophils, and macrophages, thus compromising the innate immune system's ability to combat pathogens. The
efficacy of current wound healing methods is constrained by the vulnerability to wound infection which is
exacerbated by concurrent binge drinking. Cold Plasma (CP) has recently gained substantial attention in clinical
practice due to its regenerative properties and its ability to prevent infection. Previous studies have shown that
CP treatment is involved in the wound healing mediated by the Nrf2 pathway and Wnt/β‑catenin signaling
pathway.
 Taken these solid premises together, we hypothesize that CP will improve impaired wound healing and
mitigate the increased vulnerability to infection caused by binge drinking. To substantiate these hypotheses, we
have proposed two following specific aims using F344 rat model and human skin organoid model, respectively.
Aim 1 is to characterize wound healing properties of CP in F344 rats following binge exposure to alcohol.
This aim is to examine wound closure properties of CP and to reveal molecular mechanisms underlying CP
modulation of wound healing in binge EtOH intoxicated F344 rats. Aim 2 is to generate an in-vitro wound
healing model using hiPSC derived skin organoids and to investigate the potential wound healing
properties of CP in these skin organoids given binge level of EtOH. This aim represents the translational
aspect of our studies. We first will develop and characterize 3D skin organoids using human induced pluripotent
stem cells (hiPSC) and then identify the potential wound healing properties of CP in alcohol-treated human skin
organoids. In addition, we will study molecular mechanisms and signal pathways underlying CP modulation of
wound healing in alcohol treated skin organoids using both immunofluorescence and gene expression analysis.
 These studies are highly significant because 1) we are to demonstrate the medical use of CP in wound healing
associated with EtOH intoxication, and 2) we are to address the translational value of the proposed studies using
F344 rat model and human culture of skin organoids. Successful completion of this small R03 grant award will
provide valuable therapeutic clues in CP modulation of the wound healing during EtOH intoxication. The study
outcomes shall shift the paradigms regarding the interplay between wound healing properties of CP and alcohol-
induced impairment of wound healing, eventually leading to clinical application of CP in wound healing during
EtOH intoxication. We expect a full R01 project to be developed in conclusion of this small R03 project."

Myosin 5b is responsible for transporting key apical proteins to the surface of epithelial cells. Myosin 5b is most
widely studied because of its association with Microvillus Inclusion Disease, a congenital diarrhea disorder in
which inactivating mutations in Myosin 5b is a primary cause. Individuals with Microvillus Inclusion Disease
frequently present with cholestasis in addition to their intestinal defects; indicating potential alterations in liver
function arising from loss of Myosin 5b. Data acquired under my NIDDK K01 career development award
demonstrates that germline Myosin 5b knockout mice exhibit alterations in liver function in terms of polarity and
bile acid profiles. We also observed that Myosin 5b knockout mice had lipid accumulation and altered
mitochondrial function which suggests that Myosin 5b has diverse roles in liver metabolism. This R03 proposal
seeks to build upon findings from my K01 award and identify the role of Myosin 5b in regulating liver metabolism.
The central hypothesis of this research proposal is that Myosin 5b transports and positions lipids, glycogen stores
and mitochondria within hepatocytes. We propose that in the absence of Myosin 5b lipids and glycogen stores
are immobilized preventing the proper process of these molecules. Additionally, we postulate that Myosin 5b
regulates mitochondria dynamics and function. We base our hypothesis on preliminary data generated from our
mouse model which shows changes in lipids, glycogen stores and mitochondria in the liver of Myosin 5b knockout
mice compared to littermate control mice. Liver organoids generated from Myosin 5b knockout mice exhibited
decreased oxygen consumption rates compared to control organoids demonstrating decreased mitochondrial
function. For this R03 application, we propose to use germline Myosin 5b knockout mice to address deficits in
lipid metabolism, glycogen mobilization and mitochondria in vivo and in vitro. Specific Aim 1 will define changes
in lipid and glycogen in hepatocytes resulting from loss of Myosin 5b. Specific Aim 2 will determine the role of
Myosin 5b in regulating liver mitochondrial function. We will use cutting edge research techniques including high
resolution confocal imaging, live imaging of liver organoids as well as metabolic profiling. At the completion of
these studies, we expect to have elucidated the role of Myosin 5b in the regulation of metabolic pathways in
hepatocytes. Funding of this R03 proposal would provide support and new preliminary data to base a NIDDK
R01 application. Additionally, this project will provide new research avenues for my lab that are very distinct from
my postdoctoral work and my postdoctoral mentor’s scientific interests. This R03 proposal highlights the need
for a better understanding of the function of Myosin 5b within the liver and in regulating pathways that have
historically not been linked to Myosin 5b."
10873047,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are myeloid malignancies most commonly diagnosed at an advanced age.
They are considered a spectrum of malignancies that can range from low to high grade and they are classified
based on an international prognostic system. This prognostic system separates them into a range from very low
risk with survival rates of several years to very high risk with survival rates of less than a year. Therapeutic
interventions have focused on targeting higher risk MDS (from intermediate to very high risk), as the benefit of
disease-modifying therapies far outweighs the risk of adverse effects from such therapies. Research aimed at
developing targets for this disease has described the presence of a subpopulation of leukemia stem cells, which
give rise to the disease and are therefore a critical target to eradicate this malignancy. Prior studies have defined
metabolic properties of leukemia stem cells, including their reliance in mitochondrial function and oxidative
phosphorylation; therefore, targeting oxidative phosphorylation is a potential avenue for eliminating this
subpopulation within MDS cells. There are currently very limited therapies aimed at targeting leukemia stem
cells, and this is an unmet need in this field. The candidate’s long-term goal will be to develop new therapeutic
strategies aimed at targeting this subpopulation. The hypothesis of this study is that signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) regulates mitochondrial function of leukemia stem cells via regulation of
several nuclear-encoded genes that are crucial for proper function of the mitochondria, while also translocating
to the mitochondria and modulating the function of the electron transport chain. Aim 1 will elucidate whether the
IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway regulates nuclear genes involved in survival of intermediate to very high risk MDS
stem cells. Aim 2 will determine whether IL-6/STAT3 signaling regulates the mitochondrial function of higher-risk
MDS stem cells. This will be studied by investigating the importance of STAT3 interactions with other proteins in
the mitochondria. To determine if either of these roles is essential for survival of leukemia stem cells, Aim 3 will
investigate whether targeting IL-6 or STAT3 decreases the engraftment potential of human primary MDS patient
samples in immune-deficient mice. Based on these findings, targeting STAT3 and IL-6 will be tested in in vivo
models."

Texas A&M University has a long history of training in the genetic sciences, with the first graduate degree having
been awarded in 1919. The first Interdisciplinary Program (IDP) in Genetics was the first IDP established at
Texas A&M in 1983, and has been at the forefront of diversifying not only the trainee pool that will contribute to
a diversified workforce, but is also leading in the preparedness of students for diverse career paths. The Genetics
IDP preceptors have world-renowned research programs providing unique opportunities for trainees to perform
dissertation research in laboratories using cutting-edge technologies that are addressing important and impactful
questions in modern genetics that impact human health and well-being, while also having extensive mentoring
and career development opportunities. This innovative training program aims to be a model for ‘preparing diverse
scientists for a diverse workforce’. The Genetics IDP has developed several initiatives and partnerships that
have resulted in a dramatic increase in diversity of applicants and matriculates to the program. Similar to the
need for a diverse genetics workforce, efforts are needed to diversify preparedness for future workforce needs
and career opportunities. Modern training in genetics and the sub-discipline of genomics not only requires
mastering classical Mendelian and quantitative genetics, but expertise in big data, interpersonal interactions that
is essential for convergence research, and project management that can be applied to diverse career
opportunities. The training program, which will support 4 new trainees each year for 2-year appointments (8
concurrent trainees), is designed to train the next generation of scholar in modern genetics by providing
contemporary skills and exposure to the increasingly broad range of career opportunities that these scholars will
pursue in order to have a profound impact on the future of genetic sciences. The goals of the training program
are to: 1) Provide doctoral students with balanced research and training opportunities that span the continuum
from basic science to applied applications and the scientific knowledge needed to excel in modern genetic
sciences irrespective of career path; 2) Offer a rigorous didactic training that provides the fundamentals in
Mendelian and quantitative genetics, statistics and experimental design, rigor and reproducibility, biostatistics,
big data computation skills, and a core set of competencies in communication, interpersonal interactions, and
leadership and team science that will be required for successful careers in academia, industry and government;
and 3) Ensure that trainees develop appreciation for, familiarity with, and exposure to various career
opportunities for well-trained geneticists through mentorship and introduction to experts in various fields."
10873055,"HIV remains a major public health problem, particularly for the Latina/o population. US-dwelling Latinas/os are
at increased risk for HIV-infection compared to non-Hispanic whites and suffer a disproportionate burden of
HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) which may be amplified with age. HIV-infected (HIV+)
Latinas/os of Puerto Rican origin have the highest prevalence of HAND (~78%) of any group in the US (HIV+
Mexican Americans: 44%; African Americans: ~40%, & non-Hispanic whites: ~40%). Older HIV+ Latinas/os
(50± years) appear to be at even greater risk for HAND and cognitive decline than their non-Hispanic white
counterparts, and the pattern of cognitive impairment in HAND appears to differ by ethnicity. In the general HIV
population, HAND is characterized by impairments in processing speed, attention, and executive functioning
consistent with involvement of the frontostriatal circuitry. HIV+ Puerto Rican Latinas/os present an atypical
amnestic memory profile more consistent with medial temporal lobe (MTL) involvement. Despite these
important disparities, differing cognitive profiles and possible differences in affected neural structures, the
literature on HAND in Latinas/os is almost entirely cross-sectional, does not include HIV-uninfected (HIV-)
controls, lacks studies focused on brain integrity in this population, and has yet to examine the mechanisms
underlying these disparities. Utilizing a culturally-tailored approach, the goals of this study are to investigate
whether older HIV+ Latinas/os of Puerto Rican origin demonstrate worse patterns of decline in cognitive
function and brain integrity compared to other ethnic/HIV status groups, and to uncover the biological (e.g.,
neuroinflammatory biomarkers [sTREM2, sCD14, sTNFR-II, & IL-6], cardiovascular burden) and sociocultural
(e.g., acculturation, social adversity, stress) mechanisms conferring risk for neurodegenerative and cognitive
changes in this population. To that end, this multidisciplinary study will deploy a longitudinal observational
design with 90 HIV+ and 90 HIV-matched control adults (both groups will include: 70% Latina/o and 30% non-
Hispanic white; aged 60-80 yrs) over 36-months. All participants will complete laboratory, neuromedical,
multimodal neuroimaging, and comprehensive cognitive and sociocultural assessments. Longitudinal structural
equation models will test relationships between ethnicity, HIV, and biological and sociocultural factors on
cognition (global, learning, memory, & processing speed) and MRI brain indices (white matter lesion & MTL
gray matter volumes; MTL intrinsic activity, & hippocampal intra-network connectivity). Addressing disparities in
cognitive and brain health outcomes in Latinas/os offers a vital opportunity to elucidate HAND
neuropathogenesis, disentangle the biological and sociocultural aspects of cognitive aging through the lens of
HIV-infection, and identify modifiable factors to mitigate risk for cognitive decline. As this population is the
fastest-growing sector of the US aging population, identifying culturally-relevant intervention targets to lower
age-related cognitive morbidity in Latinas/os is key for promoting brain health equity and public health."
10873191,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neural biomarkers are an important focus of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative, and they
are increasingly used in the context of genomic studies and clinical trials. The use of biomarkers with strong
psychometric reliability increases the likelihood of finding replicable effects, improves the validity of their
interpretation, and decreases the likelihood of missing real phenomena. Although fundamental psychometric
principles have long been a prominent concern among studies that use self-report measures, these principles
are underappreciated in studies of psychopathology that use biological measures. This lack of attention to
reliability limits the more widespread application of biomarkers in psychopathology and likely contributes to
replication problems. Generalizability theory is a multifaceted framework for identifying sources of
measurement error, and this framework is uniquely suited to assessing the reliability of biological measures
and to optimizing tasks for reliability. A critical need exists for tractable software to facilitate the application of
generalizability theory to time-frequency electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), facial
electromyography (EMG), and electrodermal activity (EDA). The objective of this project in response to PAR-
18-930 on measurement tool development for RDoC is to (i) develop an extensive treatment of generalizability
theory for psychopathology researchers, (ii) develop accessible software to implement it, (iii) show how to
apply these resources to optimize paradigms for individual-differences research, and (iv) disseminate the
software with a user-friendly guide. This project will facilitate the routine evaluation of reliability through these
specific aims: 1) Design and implement generalizability theory formulas for evaluating group- and subject-level
reliability for paradigm optimization; 2) Develop software to implement these formulas with data from widely
used psychophysiological software; 3) Apply results to optimize three commonly studied tasks; and 4) Develop
online educational material on the application of these resources to novel paradigms and measures. This
research project is innovative, because it represents a substantive departure from standard practice by shifting
the focus to the reliability of data from individuals, rather than groups, to identify sources of measurement error
and minimize their impact. This work promotes best practices in reporting psychometric properties of biological
measures and is applicable to data from any task with trial-wise scores. The resulting open-source toolbox, the
Psychophysiologist’s Reliability Analysis Toolbox (PsyRAT), can facilitate guidelines for optimizing paradigms,
making decisions about individual-subject data, and grounding individual-differences questions (central to
clinical research, especially for applications in precision medicine) in measures of reliability. The proposed
process for guiding biomarker evaluation through high-quality psychometrics will pave the way for better
selection of biomarkers and task development, ultimately improving the clinical utility of these biomarkers."
10873065,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Peanut allergy (PA) is the most common food allergy in the US; it is also one of the least frequently outgrown
and the leading cause of fatal food-allergic reactions. The landmark Learning Early About Peanut study found
that the ingestion of peanut products in infancy can decrease PA development by over 81%. Thus, in 2017 the
NIAID published the Prevention of Peanut Allergy (PPA) Guidelines. However, implementation of these
guidelines is unique in that they are a reversal of previous guidelines, posing additional challenges for all
stakeholders. For caregivers of young infants specifically, compliance with the PPA guidelines requires them to
understand the changing science around food allergy development, participate in early peanut feeding during
short time window (4-6 months of age), and accept the risks involved with feeding their infant a potentially
allergenic food. While studies involving pediatricians and allergists have been conducted, our current
understanding of caregiver opinions PPA guidelines and our interventions to support caregivers to adhere to
early peanut introduction are limited. Utilizing an established clinical network of over 30 pediatric clinics in Illinois
(primary mentor’s parent grant iREACH), this proposal will evaluate caregiver barriers and facilitators to the
PPA guidelines and investigate the key driving factors for adherence and nonadherence by conducting
qualitative interviews with caregivers of young children. This data will be incorporated into building a distinct
interactive intervention: iCARE (Intervention to Improve Caregiver Adherence Regarding Early Peanut
Introduction). Using web-, mobile-, and/or video-based applications, the goal of iCARE will be to address
caregiver barriers and unmet needs to facilitate early peanut introduction. After following an iterative
prototyping process to develop iCARE with stakeholders and experts, it will be tested among caregivers to
understand its efficacy, acceptability, and feasibility. This will provide preliminary data for an R01 proposal
studying the effectiveness of iCARE in a randomized clinical trial. As caregivers are the ultimate drivers of PPA
guideline implementation, this project addresses a gap in our current approach to PA prevention.
This K23 proposal addresses multiple gaps in Dr. Samady’s research skillset, providing additional training in:
1) qualitative data analysis, 2) behavioral science training, 3) development and evaluation of novel behavioral
interventions. Her primary mentor, Dr. Gupta is a national leader in food allergy prevention studies, her co-
mentor Dr. McGee is a leading expert in qualitative research and professional development, and her co-
mentors Drs. Van Horn, and Pongracic have additional expertise in developing and evaluating behavioral
interventions. Completion of these aims and training goals will support Dr. Samady’s long-term goal of
become an independent investigator and national leader studying infants with atopic disease, focused on
improving the implementation of current food allergy prevention efforts and identifying new prevention
strategies."
10873066,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease in the general population. AD is
associated with defective skin barrier function, microbial dysbiosis, as well as various cutaneous immune
abnormalities including type 2 inflammation and decreased cutaneous host defense. These abnormalities
translate into multiple phenotypes and endotypes that are not fully defined and therefore, effective targeted
therapies, beyond type 2 immune blockade, to reverse these various subsets of AD are lacking. Beyond its
effects on cutaneous defense, AD is associated with systemic inflammation and appears to be the first step in
the development of other atopic conditions including food allergy and asthma.
This grant application is being submitted in response to RFA-AI-19-014, Atopic Dermatitis Research
Network-Leadership Center (ADRN-LC). The goal of this proposal is to create an ADRN-LC which will
provide the overall scientific strategy and organizational structure to the ADRN and will interact closely with
the ADRN Clinical Research Centers (ADRN-CRCs), to support the conduct of multi-site clinical studies and
trials that will elucidate mechanisms of skin barrier dysfunction and cutaneous immune responses in
atopic dermatitis (AD).
The central hypothesis in this application is that different phenotypes and endotypes of AD are
associated with distinct defects in their skin barrier, microbiome, and skin immune responses which can
be characterized by novel approaches to skin sampling and open up avenues for paradigm shifting
therapeutic interventions to benefit patients with severe persistent AD. We will achieve our objectives
with the following Aims:
· Specific Aim 1: To establish an Administrative and Clinical Research Operations Leadership
 Center that will be responsible for implementation, coordination, and funding of clinical trials and
 studies for the ADRN-LC in research areas evaluating mechanism and treatment of AD.
· Specific Aim 2: To develop a Network-wide multi-center ADRN clinical trial to evaluate the long-
 term effects of targeted microbiome transplantation on clinical outcomes in AD as well as epithelial
barrier function, microbial dysbiosis, and cutaneous immunity.
· Specific Aim 3: To design a Network-wide ADRN one-year observational study to assess the
 stability of AD phenotypes/endotypes using a Network correlation analysis of transcriptomics
 (conventional and single cell RNA sequencing), skin tape proteomics, lipidomics, and microbiome
 over time in subjects with persistent mild vs. persistent severe AD and assessment of therapeutic
responses to topical corticosteroids and Dupilumab.
· Specific Aim 4: To carry out a Network-wide multi-center ADRN clinical trial to examine the effects
 of targeted IL-1 blockade on the clinical outcome, skin microbiome, epithelial skin barrier, and
cutaneous immune response in AD patients who have an inadequate response to IL-4/IL-13 blockade
using Dupilumab therapy.
Accomplishment of these Specific Aims will contribute to novel and important advances in our
understanding of mechanisms of host skin defense and paradigm-shifting treatments of AD. The
establishment of this ADRN-LC will also provide budgetary and scientific resources for the Systems
Biology of Early Atopy Birth Cohort study that is under development by the Consortium for Food Allergy
Research (CoFAR)."
10870942,"Project Summary/Abstract
Ovarian hormone fluctuations critically shape the brain and behavior and represent a major contributor to female
specific risks for neuropsychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety disorders. Another female-specific
factor is a double dose of the X chromosome, one of which is typically “inactivated” during development and
stays in a repressed form in somatic female cells including neurons. A subset of genes called “X escapees” are
able to escape this inactivation and contribute to sex-specific gene expression across tissues including the brain.
While some cell-, tissue-, and species-specific escapees have been described, “dynamic X escapees” are
unknown. However, in our recent study, we described putative “estrous cycle-dependent X escapees” associated
with substantial dynamism in 3D genome structure of the X chromosome across the mouse estrous cycle.
Intriguingly, we have a strong indication that the volume of the inactive X chromosome (Xi) changes in response
to fluctuating ovarian hormones. We hypothesize that Xi undergoes conformational changes in neurons across
the ovarian cycle, which can alter both X-linked and autosomal gene expression and contribute to behavioral
adaptation in response to reproductive hormone changes. In this project, we will perform two independent aims
to test our hypothesis, by studying the estrous cycle effects in two mouse genetic models. In Aim 1, we will use
the ΔXist mutant mice that will allow us to perform allele-specific genomics analyses and distinguish between
active (Xa) and inactive (Xi) X chromosomes and confirm hormone-induced Xi plasticity. In Aim 2, we will use
the 39,XO female mice that lack the inactive X chromosome and will allow us to assess the functional role of Xi
and its dynamics in gene regulation and behavior. In both aims, we will use cutting-edge, neuron-specific
genomics assays to characterize gene expression (RNA-seq) and 3D genome organization (Hi-C) in ventral
hippocampal neurons across the estrous cycle. We will also test anxiety-related behavior in XO mice and
compare it to XX and XY counterparts, to determine whether the inactive X chromosome interacts with the
estrous cycle to regulate behavior. Our findings can provide radically novel insights into sex-specific brain
regulation, opening new avenues for sex-and gender-informed treatments of brain disorders, with critical
implications for women’s mental health."
10870950,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage kidney failure in the USA and is increasing in prevalence at an alarming rate worldwide with no targeted therapy available. The pathogenesis of DKD is complex, influenced by genetics and the environment. The underlying genetic susceptibilities to DKD remain poorly understood.
To investigate the genetic basis of DKD, we studied diabetes-induced podocyte depletion associated with DKD susceptibility in inbred DBA/2J mice and C57BL/6J mice, well established mouse models for DKD susceptibility and resistance, respectively. We also examined the BXD recombinant inbred panel to map genetic loci (QTL) associated with podocyte number after long-term diabetes (6 months). These studies identified a genome wide significant cis-acting regulatory region for the Xor gene encoding xanthine oxidoreductase (Xdh+XO) and an important source for ROS production in diabetes. Our data show Xor expression and activity was strongly increased by diabetes in glomeruli of DBA/2J, but not C57BL/6J resistant mice. A functional role for Xor was confirmed by a significant amelioration of albuminuria, endothelial cell mtDNA oxidative stress damage and podocyte loss in diabetic DBA/2J mice co-treated with a Xor inhibitor. We hypothesize that Xors are key contributors to phenotypic consequences in diabetes, and differential Xor regulation can predispose to DKD. We used genome editing clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 to knock in the high risk Xor promoter variants in whole animals and generated B6-Xorem1 mice to comprehensively study the effects of Xor regulation and activity in diabetes. Diabetic B6-Xorem1 mice had increased diabetic kidney injury and significant podocyte depletion compared to the parental C57BL/6J strain. B6-Xorem1 mice showed increased oxidative stress and an accumulation of mitochondrial DNA damage specifically in the glomerular endothelial cells, which was prevented by a small molecule inhibitor of Xor. Therefore, differential regulation of Xor contributed to phenotypic consequences with diabetes. We also uncovered promoter XOR orthologue variants associated with high-risk for DKD in a large human cohort. Our proposed studies will advance our understanding of DKD genetics and determine the therapeutic potential for gene editing in 2 Specific Aims: 1) To edit the high risk Xor promoter variants for DKD using gene editing. 2) To interrogate the genetics of human XOR orthologues.
 
LONG-TERM: Our proposed studies will advance our understanding of mice and human genetics for risk of diabetic complications by investigating the role of Xor promoter risk variant, ROS, glomerular endothelial injury and cell crosstalk with podocytes. The study also proposes to edit the risk variants using gene editing with the potential for a future treatment for patients at risk of DKD."

 Our lab works in the general area of computational structural biology although it also includes an
experimental component. We carry out theoretical and computational research and develop software tools, with
our efforts being guided by a variety of applications of biomedical importance. In the past we have elucidated
the structural and energetic origins of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, developed methods
for protein structure prediction, and detected novel structural and functional relationships between proteins based
on their geometric similarity. We currently focus on two distinct areas: the exploitation of structural information
to predict protein function on a genome-wide scale and the molecular basis of cell-cell recognition. The former
topic is the subject of the current proposal which focuses on the prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs)
and protein interaction networks. Our overarching goal is to provide a structure-informed perspective in multiple
areas of systems biology, thus filling a major gap in this rapidly growing area of biomedical research.
 Our research plans are derived from our development of the PrePPI algorithm and corresponding
database of human PPIs. PrePPI provides proteome-wide structure-based predictions of PPIs, and discovers
relationships not obtainable from other methods. The P-HIPSTer algorithm, which is derived from PrePPI, offers
analogous information for virus-human PPIs for 1000 human-infecting viruses. The reliability of both resources
has been validated experimentally, and both have revealed novel biological insights. PrePPI, in common with
other PPI databases, is cell-context independent and, for example, does not distinguish among tissue and tumor
types. To address this challenge, we developed the OncoSig algorithm that uses machine learning methods to
combine PrePPI with regulatory interactions from patient genomic data. The generation of tumor-specific lists of
PPIs, called SigSets, can then be mapped onto a context-dependent PPI network, or SigMap. We have also
developed novel methodologies that link protein structure space with chemical compound space.
 The current proposal builds on these accomplishments with new methodological developments and new
applications to network biology. We plan to integrate PrePPI with PPI information derived from genetic
interactions derived from the correlation of gene profiles across many conditions (e.g. tumor types, cell lines or
drug treatments). This will provide an unprecedented structure- and context-dependent view of protein interaction
networks. Other plans include the extension of PrePPI to non-human genomes and the extension of P-HIPSTer
to bacterial pathogens. Our overall vision includes the development of an integrated set of software tools and
databases that will advance cutting edge biomedical applications. These tools will range in scope from protein-
protein interaction networks, structure-derived protein function annotation and to the linking of network biology
to chemical compound space which will suggest druggable targets within networks and provide leads for small
molecules that can target individual proteins."

Cardiovascular diseases are responsible for more deaths each year than cancer, which is why it is important to
study how to keep hearts healthy. Hearts undergo physiological remodeling; this is a structural and functional
adjustment that matches contractile capacity to hemodynamic demand. In cardiomyocytes, hormonal and
mechanosensitive signaling pathways maintain the balance between normal cell size, hypertrophy, or atrophy.
Pathologies develop when the adequate adaptation to a stimulus is mismatched. My long-term goal is to
establish an independent research program on understanding how mechanical load affects myocardial
structure and function and what are the contributing molecular mechanisms. My recent publication in the
Journal of General Physiology shows that changing mechanical stimulus of cardiac myocytes affects the
dynamics and post-translational modification of the Z-disc actin-capping protein CapZ. I wish to extend this in a
new direction working as an independent investigator. Accordingly, my central hypothesis is that mechanical
load of cardiomyocytes regulates protein homeostasis in sarcomeres through the balance between acetylation
and ubiquitination of lysine residues. Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is one known acetylation enzyme of
sarcomeric proteins. I focus on the Z-disc proteins CapZ and α-actinin because they both maintain sarcomere
integrity and because acetylation sites have been previously found in both proteins. My preliminary data shows
that unloading changes the relative abundance of CapZ and α-actinin ubiquitination and acetylation. The goal
of the K99 mentored phase is (1) to determine post-translational modifications arising from chemical or
mechanical unloading of isolated cardiomyocytes with focus on acetylation and K48-oligo-ubiquitination. The
goals of the R00 independent phase are (2) to characterize how HDAC3 activity in cardiomyocytes regulates
α-actinin and CapZ deacetylation with varying mechanical load and (3) to determine the changes in post-
translational modification of sarcomeric proteins by HDAC3 during left-ventricular unloading in whole hearts.
The innovation of this project lies in the combination of cardiomyocyte mechanobiology with post-translational
molecular biochemistry to understand how cardiac cells maintain sarcomeric protein balance through the
ubiquitin-acetylation pathway in response to mechanical stimuli. The outcomes of this project will expand our
knowledge about the signaling pathways responsible for modulating protein homeostasis in cardiomyocytes
that may develop new research lines for regulation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathies and sarcopenia. The
career development activities in this proposal, in addition to the exceptional mentoring team and research
environment at the University of Illinois at Chicago, will support my successful transition to a career as an
independent investigator."

five years. We will leverage accumulated expertise, training materials, networks of international collaborators,
and well-developed and tested online and face-to-face training curricula to expand the Tajikistan program and
to add Indonesia to the program. Close collaborations between US, Tajik and Indonesian faculty involved in this
proposal are well-established and fully functional. The expanded Center for Botanicals and Chronic Diseases
(CBCD) will cement and synergize these existing collaborations and provide quality international experience for
our trainees. In the next five years, CBCD will focus its training on the evidence-based, rigorous studies of local
botanicals for the prevention and treatment of common inflammation-associated chronic diseases and disorders,
such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis, and
intestinal and neurological disorders.
 CBCD will train 10 scientists in Tajikistan (5 Ph.D. students and 5 postdoctoral fellows) and 24 scientists
in Indonesia (16 M.S. and 8 Ph.D. students). Both countries are providing a significant financial match to enable
the training. Research training components will include: 1) Online courses and e-workshops; 2) One-on-one e-
mentoring and progress monitoring; 3) Annual in-country conferences and workshops with invited international
speakers; 4) Visits to mentor's laboratories in the US (funded by Tajikistan for Tajik students); and 5) Required
graduate and postdoctoral courses offered in partnering countries.
 CBCD will involve three U.S. institutions - Rutgers University, Pennington Biomedical Research
Center/Louisiana State University, and Eugenio María de Hostos Community College (CUNY), a minority serving
institution specializing in health-related training. Internationally, CBCD will involve three leading Tajik institutions
and two top-tier Indonesian universities. In addition to its official trainees, CBCD will open its distance learning
courses, on-line training and in-country events to a wider audience of local scientists and health professionals,
ensuring a broader community outreach.
 CBCD’s aim is to provide a sustainable foundation for intense research training and retention of local
scientists in the interdisciplinary studies of botanicals for the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. Our
integrated training program will leverage resources generated through other NIH-funded programs that involve
the research training faculty participating in this proposal: NIH National Center for Botanicals and Metabolic
Resiliency (2004 – present); NIH T32 Training Grant in Botanical Approaches to Combat Metabolic Syndrome
(just renewed for a 5 year third cycle) and the completed International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups (ICBG)
program titled “Building New Pharmaceutical Capabilities in Central Asia.” CBCD will also take advantage of the
world-wide research training infrastructure established by the Global Institute for Bioexploration (GIBEX)."

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a family of small-molecules in living systems that serve vital
roles in both signaling and stress. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide (O2•-), and hypochlorous
acid (HOCl), among others, are all examples of ROS that have been traditionally viewed as
sources of oxidative stress and damage. Aberrant ROS production contributes to a multitude of
pathologies such as neurodegeneration, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders. However, ROS
are also critical for maintaining metabolic homeostasis through activation of multiple classes of
proteins. This signal-stress dichotomy, coupled with the small and transient nature of ROS,
presents a challenge when attempting to decode the complex landscape of cellular redox
homeostasis. Fluorescent probes are frequently employed to visualize ROS in living systems
through fluorescence microscopy, however these probes are prone to diffusion after ROS
detection. This leads to inaccurate determination of ROS localization and poor signal-to-noise
responses. As such, there is a need to create probes amenable to the permanent recording of
ROS via fluorescence imaging. We hypothesize that activity-based cell-trappable fluorescent
probes can be used as a platform to gain further understanding of ROS-mediated inter- and intra-
cellular signaling. We propose three specific aims to test this hypothesis. First, we will synthesize
fluorophores caged with activity-based triggers and proximal fluoromethyl groups to serve as
latent equivalents of quinone methide upon ROS sensing. ROS responsive uncaging will allow
for the fluorescent labeling of adjacent biomolecules. Second, we will apply our probes across
multiple model live cell lines to monitor ROS fluxes. We will also map cell-to-cell communication
mediated by ROS using microglia-neuron co-culture as a biological model. This system will allow
us to probe transcellular redox signaling as microglia can be selectively activated in the presence
of neurons thereby dispatching H2O2 to nearby neurons. The third aim involves developing a
fluorescent polymer amplification strategy to increase signal-to-noise responses of tandem
activity-based sensing/labeling probes and will primarily be carried out in the R00 phase. Small-
molecule polymer initiators will be caged in a similar manner to the previously described
fluorescent probes. After ROS sensing and biomolecule labeling, polymerization will be performed
to generate fluorescent polymers from biomolecule surfaces thus enabling signal amplification
and visualization. This strategy will be carried over into live cell lines described above. This
research fits into the applicant’s goal of establishing a program which uses polymer chemistry to
probe fundamental questions in biological systems."

This is a new application for a T32 to support predoctoral training in Biochemistry, Cell and Developmental
Biology (BCDB) at Emory University. The award will replace the current T32 training program, which is in its 29th
year, and has successfully trained a diverse cohort of students for the biomedical research workforce. We are
requesting 7 positions and anticipate the duration of appointment will be 12-24 months. The mission of the BCDB
training program is to provide an outstanding training environment through evidenced-based learning
approaches and top caliber research mentors for development of our Ph.D. level workforce in academic-,
industry- and government-based research careers as well as other biomedical research-related careers. This
mission will be accomplished through a core curriculum that includes discussion-based, active learning
approaches to the fundamental principles of biological processes at the biochemical and cellular level and
development of oral and written presentation skills through classroom and seminar experiences. In addition, the
importance of rigor and reproducibility in biomedical research is emphasized throughout the training with a
required course as well as emphasizing this training as part of the courses, seminars and journal clubs. The
objectives of the training program are to use these approaches to provide Ph.D. scientists with the necessary
skills in critical thinking, experimental design and quantitative approaches as they acquire an understanding of
how to conduct their work in a manner that is responsible, rigorous and reproducible. The program has an
inclusive environment and is active in the recruitment and retention of students from diverse backgrounds. There
is also an established focus on training the faculty mentors to provide the most outstanding training environment
possible. The program also provides unique training opportunities to students supported by the proposed T32
training program through their responsibilities in running an innovative journal club as well as their role in
organizing the two annual BCDB symposia; one which highlights career opportunities for Ph.D. graduates. We
plan to continue our track record of training success while also introducing new and innovative aspects to the
training together with mechanisms to evaluate both student and program outcomes."

The cardioprotective benefits of omega 3 (n-3) highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) have been called into
question due to conflicting results of clinical trials. Our work over the past decade has revealed that genetic
variation in the fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1) gene and race may be significant drivers of the effectiveness of
n-3 HUFA supplementation. FADS1 is the rate limiting step in the conversion of the dietary n-6 and n-3
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), linoleic acid (LA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA), respectively, to n-6 and n-3
HUFAs, including arachidonic acid (ARA, n-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, n-3), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA,
n-3), and their biologically active oxylipin metabolites. The importance of genetic variation encoding the
desaturase steps in this pathway was recently highlighted when the FADS1-FADS2 gene cluster was identified
as the largest multimorbidity cluster in the entire human genome with over 40 phenotypes related to lipid and fat
metabolism, inflammatory disorders, and multiple cancers. A central discovery from our work and others is the
differential disease mechanism-relevant synthesis of HUFAs and metabolism to bioactive lipids across racial
groups. This is perhaps most apparent when comparing European Americans (EuAm) and African Americans
(AfAm) in that AfAm have much higher frequencies of FADS1 variants that are associated with the efficient
conversion of dietary LA to ARA and its pro-inflammatory/pro-thrombotic oxylipins. Clinical evidence in support
of this work comes from our re-analysis of the VITAL n-3 HUFA supplementation trial which demonstrated that
AfAm, but not EuAm may have strongly benefitted from n-3 supplementation, with an ~ 80% reduction in
myocardial infarction (MI). We then applied two machine learning methods to matched data from AfAm and
EuAm VITAL participants and found strong evidence that n-3 supplementation significantly decreased MI only
in AfAm with the odds ratio between the treatment and placebo groups of 0.178 (95% CI [0.046 0.69]). These
data lead to this proposal’s central hypothesis that gene-diet interactions drive an imbalance in ARA versus EPA
and DHA and their oxylipin products particularly in AfAm. We postulate that optimally-dosed n-3 HUFA
supplementation will decrease the ratio of ARA to EPA and DHA, providing a major benefit to AfAm. We propose
a two-site randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover n-3 HUFA supplementation trial that
leverages the extraordinary diversity and community-based recruitment experiences of our partnering institutions
to test our hypothesis. Specifically, we will supplement AfAm and EuAm participants stratified by FADS1
genotype with EPA-enriched n-3 HUFAs and evaluate changes in the balance of HUFA-containing lipids and
oxylipin products, as well as inflammatory and clinical biomarkers linked to CVD. This trial will provide critical
missing evidence for genetic and racial heterogeneity and resulting differential biological response to n-3 HUFAs
in AfAm and EuAm. These data are essential to the future design of definitive precision nutrition clinical trials to
prevent chronic diseases and reduce health disparities."
10878612,"Project Summary/Abstract
The rewiring of transcriptional circuits over evolutionary time is a major source of biological
novelty. This proposal seeks to determine the detailed molecular mechanisms that underlie
transcriptional rewiring using unicellular yeasts as a model system. The strategy is based on
direct experimentation in many different yeast species in the Saccharomycetaceae lineage, and
utilizes genome-wide transcriptional profiling, chromatic immunoprecipitation, phylogenetic
comparisons, and ancestral protein reconstructions. Circuit comparisons among these yeasts
uncover specific examples of transcriptional rewiring, and deeper analyses reveal the molecular
mechanisms by which the wiring changes occurred. Although much rewiring is probably neutral,
some of it appears adaptive: indeed a major mechanism for evolutionary novelty involves rewiring
transcriptional circuitry to allow new expression patterns of existing gene products. Thus, to truly
understand the structures of transcription circuits in modern species, we need to know the
mechanisms by which they rapidly evolve and how these mechanisms lead to and, thereby can
account for, modern structures."

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in American men and is responsible for 3% of total
deaths and 10% of deaths by cancer. Most patients experience a slow-progressing disease and are assigned
to active surveillance. These patients are spared immediate radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation that is
used for patients that have more advanced disease. Because assignment to active surveillance is imperfect,
some patients are unnecessarily overtreated, with the burdens of unnecessary side effects, cost, and lower
quality of life, whereas a few patients that need prompt radical treatment may experience delays. The limited
treatment options available for aggressive disease usual fail within a few years. Thus, there is an unmet clinical
need for low toxicity preventive/interceptive agents or natural products that prevent PCa progression either
during active surveillance or after RP or radiation treatment.
S phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) is a putative oncogene that targets several tumor suppressors for
degradation. The Skp2 gene is amplified in several human cancers. In PCa, Skp2 is overexpressed in pre-
malignant high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PIN) and in primary tumors, suggesting a role in
the early stages of PCa. Skp2 deletion blocks tumorigenesis in Rb1, p53, or Pten deficient mouse models,
suggesting that Skp2 may serve as an “Achilles' heel” drug target against pRb, p53 and/or Pten-deficient
cancer. However, inhibitors that disrupt Skp2 protein-protein interactions or cause degradation through the
proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) have had limited success. Thus, we propose to instead screen
directly for natural products that target Skp2 for degradation. In a collaboration with the National Center for
Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), we will use 500,000 natural product samples that are known to
include highly diversified chemotypes with cancer-preventive properties. To implement the screen, we have
developed a cell-based luciferase assay for degradation of Skp2 and several other resources including our
large PCa patient cohort, our prostate-specific human Skp2 knock-in mouse model of early prostate
carcinogenesis, our PCa patient-derived organoid cultures, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models.
In Specific Aim 1 (UG3) we will optimize our cell-base luciferase assay, develop a prototype HTS assay for
screening skp2 degraders, and perform mechanistic studies of products that have potential utility. In Specific
Aim 2 (UG3) we will quantitate Skp2 protein in PCa progression. This is a step towards identifying patients that
would benefit from interception via a Skp2 degrader, which will be important for developing a novel clinical trial.
In Specific Aim 3 (UH3) we will complete a full-scale HTS of up to 500,000 natural products with NCATS. We
will perform activity-based characterization and bioassay-directed isolation, structural elucidation, and perform
mechanistic studies of leads generated during screening. In Specific Aim 4 (UH3) we will determine the in vivo
chemopreventive efficacy, toxicity, and mechanisms of two confirmed compounds through dietary
administration in a novel prostate-specific human Skp2 knock-in mouse carcinogenesis model and in PDX
models.
Impact: Positive results from this study will identify novel natural products for interception of progression in
early stage PCa. Measuring Skp2 in a large PCa patient population will allow identification of patients most
likely to respond, allowing development of a novel clinical trial."

Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) are joint-lining non-hematopoietic cells that in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
contribute to local joint inflammation and damage. There is interest in discovering FLS-directed therapeutic
agents that could be combined with current immunosuppressant disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents
(DMARDs). This renewal proposal focuses on understanding the mechanism of action and regulation of the
tyrosine phosphatase PTPRS, which plays a critical role in FLS migration and invasion.
In the first cycle of this grant, we have shown that PTPRS is an important regulator of FLS aggressiveness during
RA and developed an approach to modulate PTPRS function in rheumatoid FLS. Our studies showed that on
the surface of RA FLS, PTPRS is kept in an inactive state through specific binding to the heparan sulfate (HS)-
proteoglycan syndecan-4 through a mechanism called the proteoglycan switch. Treatment of RA FLS with a
decoy fragment of PTPRS encompassing its two most extracellular proteoglycan-binding immunoglobulin
domains (called Ig1&2) causes detachment of PTPRS from syndecan-4. This leads to PTPRS-dependent
inhibition of migration and invasiveness via dephosphorylation of the PTPRS substrate ezrin. In vivo
administration of Ig1&2 reverses arthritis in multiple mouse models via a non-immunological mechanism. We
also find that PTPRS expression is inhibited on RA FLS by tumor necrosis factor alpha, suggesting that PTPRS
expression is regulated by joint inflammation.
In the second cycle of the grant, we would like to deepen our knowledge of the mechanism of action and
regulation of PTPRS in FLS and RA. Here we propose to a series of mechanistic studies in primary human FLS
and mouse models of RA aimed at understanding the regulation of PTPRS expression in RA FLS (Aims 1) and
how Ig1&2 and PTPRS regulate FLS-induced inflammation in arthritis (Aim 2). We will also use biochemical,
structural, and cellular biology approaches to understand the key molecular determinants for PTPRS regulation
by syndecan-4 (Aim 3).
Our long-term goal remains to understand the biology of PTPRS in RA FLS, which will help to complete the
validation of the PTPRS-regulated pathway as a therapeutic target for RA."

Prenatal alcohol exposure is estimated to impact 1-5% of children in the US alone. Yet, many
individuals who have been exposed prenatally to alcohol and suffer from fetal alcohol spectrum
disorders (FASD) fail to be recognized. This failure is due, in large part, to a paucity of specialized
clinics and expert dysmorphologists who are trained to identify FASD. Access to appropriate
diagnostic expertise is particularly limited in remote areas. Unfortunately, if individuals with FASD
are not recognized and diagnosed, they do not receive critically needed services nor can they
access potential interventions early in life, when intervention is most likely to be effective.
The CIFASD5 Diagnostic-Telemedicine Resource (DTR) will ensure consistent and accurate
assessment of the physical characteristics of FASD across the CIFASD research sites. In
addition, the DTR will address the critical need for increased diagnostic capacity through training
of non-expert practitioners across CIFASD5 sites using telemedicine-based methods. In the
previous CIFASD4 iteration, telemedicine approaches were tested for this purpose in a small
sample of clinicians and found to be an effective method for training and monitoring of new
examiners. In CIFASD5, this method will be extended to multiple sites and be employed in the
evaluation of over 1,800 children and adults.
However, telemedicine alone is insufficient to expand capacity and ensure consistency and
accuracy of diagnosis. To that end, several novel eHealth tools have been developed to assist in
the detection of physical features associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. These tools hold
promise in providing simple and efficient ways to screen and identify FASD. These include
MorpheusQ, a smart-phone based app that automates facial feature detection; Face-to-Gene, a
2D facial image diagnostic aid used by clinical geneticists to screen for potential syndromes; and
3D facial image signatures. These tools are scalable and have the potential to improve screening
and diagnosis across the globe, even in remote areas, such as in Alaska. However, the diagnostic
accuracy of these tools needs to be systematically compared to standardized dysmorphological
exams. It is essential to determine whether eHealth tools can effectively replace and/or improve
traditional exams before they are widely implemented."

Altered metabolism is a hallmark of malignancy. Metabolic pathway changes contribute to cancer cell growth,
transformation and survival. These differences can be exploited to image tumor tissue and provide predictive
information to patients. Importantly, these metabolic differences can also be exploited therapeutically. Thus,
understanding cancer metabolism has important implications for pathophysiology and clinical oncology.
Progress in translating these studies into new therapies is limited by the fact that much of knowledge in tumor
metabolism is derived from studies in cultured cells with unknown relevance to disease biology. Similarly, cell
line xenografts may not accurately recapitulate the cellular heterogeneity of a primary tumor. For these reasons,
little is known about tumor metabolism in vivo, and the factors that regulate this behavior. My proposal utilizes
clinical samples wherein the metabolic behavior of the primary human tumor is evaluated and characterized.
These tissues are translated to mouse models, where I will evaluate what metabolic phenotypes are retained,
as well as test what intrinsic and extrinsic factors promote metabolic behavior. During the mentored phase of the
grant, I will focus on identifying retained/intrinsic metabolic phenotypes, as well as extrinsic factors such as the
role of tumor perfusion on nutrient preference. With these insights, I will continue independent research focusing
on the molecular details of these factors, to identify combinations of factors influencing cancer metabolism in
vivo."
10878418,"ABSTRACT
Licensed influenza vaccines commonly elicit strain-specific immunity, failing to provide protection against
antigenically distinct strains with the capacity to cause pandemic outbreaks. Therefore, the development of a
universal influenza vaccine with the capacity to elicit lifelong protection against diverse influenza virus strains is
critically needed to prevent future influenza pandemics. Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) represents a key vaccine
target, as it is the major glycoprotein expressed on the surface of influenza virions and mediates viral entry and
fusion. HA comprises two distinct functional domains: (i) the globular head, which is highly variable due to
antigenic drift, and (ii) the stalk domain, which is structurally conserved among diverse influenza strains.
Influenza infection or vaccination commonly elicits immune responses against immunodominant, strain-specific
epitopes on the HA head. By contrast, immune responses against highly conserved epitopes are limited and
short-lived, despite conferring broad and heterologous protection. Refocusing the immune response towards
conserved, immunosubdominant HA epitopes, while avoiding eliciting strain-specific immunity, represents a
promising strategy for the development of a universal influenza vaccine that would confer broad protection
against diverse influenza strains. To achieve this, the proposed studies aim to develop and evaluate novel HA
immunogens, termed mosaic HAs (mHA), in which the immunodominant, strain-specific epitopes at the head
domain have been replaced from those of exotic HAs which humans are naïve, while immunosubdominant,
conserved epitopes have been retained. In previous studies, we have dissected the mechanisms by which
antibodies, through specific interactions of their Fc domains with activating Type I Fcγ receptors (FcγRs), such
as FcγRIIa on dendritic cells and with the Type II FcγR, CD23, on B cells modulate cellular and humoral immunity
against influenza, respectively. Given the immunomodulatory consequences of Fc-FcγR interactions, the
proposed studies will develop Fc-engineered mHA immunogens that will engage and activate specific FcγR
pathways on defined effector cell populations to elicit broad and long-lasting immunity against diverse influenza
strains. We anticipate that the proposed studies will lead to the design, selection, and pre-clinical evaluation of
innovative immunogens with the capacity to confer durable and heterologous protection against influenza. These
studies are expected to have important implications not only for our efforts towards the development of a
universal influenza vaccine, but also provide the framework for the design of vaccines with long-lasting and broad
protection against other viral pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2."
10881745,"Exposure to the ultraviolet (UV) rays of sunlight is the primary cause of skin cancer, which kills greater than
20,000 U.S. individuals each year. Veterans are at increased risk for skin cancer development due to increased
sun exposure during training and deployment. UV exposure also causes photoaging that results in cells
acquiring a post-mitotic phenotype called senescence. In addition to sun exposure, age and treatment with
immunosuppressants are the most significant risk factors for skin cancer development. In this proposal, we will
examine our novel 2 component cancer field model of cutaneous carcinogenesis that links photoaging and
immunosuppression to skin cancer development. Historically, the cancer field refers to multifocal areas of
otherwise normal epithelium that are at increased risk for cancer development. This epithelial cancer field is
characterized by the stepwise accumulation of mutations that eventually lead to malignant conversion. We
have shown that UV induces a multifocal dermal senescent field that is characterized by inflammatory
angiogenesis that can be visualized and measured by imaging the dermal hemoglobin (Hb) content. This
dermal field persists & expands following cessation of UV treatments and predicts sites of overlying epidermal
clonal expansion & tumor formation. In this proposal, we propose that a dermal field also exists and that the
key characteristic of this dermal field is the presence of senescent cells. These senescent cells produce and
secrete specific pro-inflammatory, mitogenic and immunomodulatory mediators that we propose drive the
continued development of the overlying epithelial mutant field. However, the immune system can recognize
and clear senescent cells (senescence surveillance). We predict that this immune-mediated clearance acts to
suppress the effects of the senescent dermal field on tumor formation. We expect that treatment with
immunosuppressive drugs would promote tumorigenesis by blocking immune-mediated clearance of dermal
senescent cells. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is a cytokine that is necessary for UV-induced
senescence and is produced by senescent cells. This TGF-β production can in turn result in the induction of
senescence in nearby cells (bystander senescence). We propose that bystander senescence, in an
immunosuppressed setting, provides a self-perpetuating mechanism that drives senescent field persistence
AND expansion. Finally, not all immunosuppressive agents have the same capacity to promote skin cancer
development. Cyclosporine A promotes skin cancer development, TGF-β production, and induces senescence.
In contrast, sirolimus has a limited effect on skin cancer risk, is known to suppresses TGF-β production, and
suppresses senescent cell formation and secretory activity. In this proposal, we will determine whether the UV-
induced senescent field is necessary for skin cancer development, determine whether immunosuppressive
therapy promotes senescent field development and persistence, and determine whether TGF-β signaling &
bystander senescence play central roles in this process. This will be done in three aims:
Aim 1: Determine whether senolytic therapy inhibits photocarcinogenesis and dermal field persistence.
Examine whether senolytic therapy and loss of TGF-β signaling block the ability of cyclosporine A to enhance,
and sirolimus to suppress, UV-induced tumor formation.
Aim 2. Use single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and dermal whole transcriptome sequencing and
differential expression analysis to characterize the differences between hyperemic and non-hyperemic foci.
Aim 3. Determine whether cyclosporine A suppresses senescence surveillance and promotes bystander
senescence in wildtype while sirolimus acts to suppress bystander senescence. The role of TGF-β on bystander
senescence will also be assessed."
10881746,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal and devastating human malignancies, with a 5-year survival rate of
approximately 6%. Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (CaP) is challenging due to lack of reliable diagnostic
markers and limited understanding of the etiological factors. Heavy alcohol consumption constitutes a
significant social problem and has been identified as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Alcohol use disorders
frequently co-occur in military veterans and civilians; thus, these populations are vulnerable to face a
disproportionate burden of increased risk to develop pancreatic cancer. This application will address evaluating
the cellular and molecular mechanism by which alcohol increases pancreatic cancer risk. It will be highly
significant and beneficial to understand the underlying mechanism of this complex disease association.
Therefore, the overarching goal of this application is to examine the biological role of alcohol toxicity in the
induction of pancreatic cancer and to identify genes mediating alcohol induced cellular transformation and
progression of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer growth and persistence depend on the cancer stem cells
(CSCs) that also induce recurrence and resist current chemo- and radiotherapies. Our preliminary data
demonstrate that ethanol induced cellular transformation of normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. Chronic
ethanol exposure induced malignant transformation of HPNE cells by causing inflammation (upregulated IL-6,
IL-8, TNFα, and IL-1β genes, inhibited glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and glutathione peroxidases (GPx),
and induced stem cell markers). Interestingly, we identified that the expression pattern of Engrailed-2 (EN2), a
homeobox-containing transcription factor was significantly altered in ethanol-transformed HPNE cells, and the
induction of EN2 correlated with the rate of transformation. However, the biological function and molecular
mechanism of EN2 in pancreatic cancer have never been examined. We demonstrate that overexpression of
EN2 in human pancreatic normal ductal epithelial cells induces malignant transformation by generating CSCs,
and regulating Notch-Hes1 pathway; suggesting that the expression of EN2 is oncogenic for pancreatic cancer.
Further, we have shown that EN2 regulates transcription of pluripotency maintaining factors, that are required
for sustaining the stem cells capacity for self-renewal and that the expression of EN2 is tightly regulated in
cancer. EN2 is highly expressed in pancreatic CSCs and cancer cell lines, but not in normal pancreatic cells or
normal pancreatic tissues. Further, we have shown that inhibition of EN2 attenuated CSC characteristics,
Notch pathway, and tumor growth in mice. Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that alcohol
induces inflammatory environment during transformation resulting in induction of EN2, which acts as a key
regulator of pluripotency and self-renewal and inhibition of EN2 in ethanol-transformed cells attenuates their
tumorigenic potential. To examine the role of alcohol in pancreatic cancer and address the above hypothesis
we propose to integrate functional, molecular, biochemical and histological approaches. Gain and loss of EN2
functional studies will be performed in vitro and in vivo. EN2 expression will be knocked down by CRISPR-
Cas9 technology in vitro. Novel triple transgenic mice (LSL-KrasG12D; LSL-EN2+/+; Pdx-Cre) will be generated
and effects of alcohol on pancreatic carcinogenesis will be compared in the presence or absence of EN2
(KrasG12D/EN2+/+, and KrasG12D/EN2-/- mice). We will examine the involvement of Notch-Hes1 pathway to
assess the biological effects of alcohol mediated by EN2. The studies proposed in this application will enhance
our understanding of the biology of ethanol-induced cellular transformation of normal pancreatic ductal
epithelial cells, which will be significant for the management of pancreatic cancer."

One in three youth in the United States are overweight, and 85% of all overweight youth have at least one 
Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) risk factor that increases their chance of developing cardiovascular disease. 
Comprehensive school- and evidence-based interventions (EBIs) that focus on students’ physical activity and 
fruit and vegetable consumption can reduce a school’s prevalence of overweight students by up to 8%. 
Additionally, multi-level interventions that target school health environments may be more effective than 
interventions that focus on individuals alone. Currently, there is an absence of multi-level EBIs for middle 
school students that address both physical activity and healthy eating behaviors and environments. Strong 
Teens for Healthy Schools Change Club (STHS-CC) is a novel, multi-level, and theory-based civic engagement 
program that equips and supports middle school students in racially/ethnically diverse, Title 1 middle schools 
to make a positive food and physical activity environmental change and personally engage in physical activity 
and healthy eating behaviors to reduce their MetS risk. This study utilizes a community advisory board to
engage Cooperative Extension agents, 4-H staff, school administrators, teachers, and students in the 
refinement of STHS-CC for the middle school setting. Once refined, the community advisory board oversees 
the delivery and testing of STHS-CC using traditional and collaborative data analysis processes (e.g., 
Photovoice) in a pilot cluster-randomized controlled trial (n=20 schools; 20-25 participants per school). At the 
individual level, this study tests STHS-CC’s effectiveness for improving students’ MetS risk factors and positive 
youth development outcomes (i.e., competence, confidence, character, connection, and caring). At the social 
level, this study evaluates peers’ support for and participation in physical activity and healthy eating behaviors. 
At the environmental level, this study evaluates the physical, situational, and policy aspects of schools’ physical 
activity and nutrition environments. Long-term, the goal of this body of work is to motivate middle school 
students to improve their physical activity and nutrition behaviors and environments through a student led
EBI that is part of a collection of comprehensive school-based health promotion programs. If effective, STHSCC has the potential to be disseminated through schools, Cooperative Extension networks, and 4-H

This project aims to develop new analytic tools for understanding accumulation patterns of physical activity (PA),
sedentary behavior (SB) and sleep in the 24-hour activity cycle and to ﬂexibly model these patterns and health
outcomes, such as cardiovascular diseases, and apply these methods in PA epidiological studies that collected
objective measurements by accelerometry or wearable devices. In physical activity epidemiology, each inten-
sity/behavior category has been investigated separately in association with health outcomes. However, this
approach fails to account for the inter-relatedness and interactions among of these activities. In fact, the 2018
Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientiﬁc Report identiﬁed 24-hour cycle and dose-response
PA/SB accumulation patterns among the most important and critical issues that clearly need future research for
informing the next set of physical activity guidelines.
 Motivated by this critical need, we propose novel statistical methods to utilize the rich information collected by
accelerometry in a few directions. First, we develop robust functional data analysis methods for ﬂexibly modeling
associations between accelerometry-measured PA trajectories and health outcomes. Second, we develop ﬂexible
functional data analysis methods for characterizing dose-response relationships between PA/SB accumulation
patterns and health outcomes, using an interpretable functional principal component analysis approach. Third,
we plan to develop nonparametric compositional data analysis (NCDA) methods for extracting patterns of the 24-
hour activity cycle, extend the approach to longitudinal studies and to ﬂexibly investigate associations between
24-hour activity compositional patterns and health.
 The proposed analytic tools are directly motivated by and will be immediately applied to ancillary studies of
the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) that we are involved in, the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular
Health (OPACH) Study, WHI Strong and Healthy Trial (WHISH), the Sedentary Time and Aging (STAR) Program,
the Women's Health Accelerometry Collaboration (WHAC), as well as the publicly available National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and UK Biobank data."

Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an autosomal recessive disorder of ectopic calcification with considerable
morbidity and mortality due to deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals in the connective tissues. Though ABCC6
was identified as the causative gene for PXE 20 years ago, the disease mechanism was just recently unveiled
and there is currently still no effective or specific treatment for the pathologic calcification. We have previously
developed and characterized mouse models for PXE, and these mice provide the platform for preclinical
development of therapeutics for this currently intractable condition. A critical pathological characteristic in PXE
is the lack of ABCC6 transport activity in the liver resulting in reduction of circulating levels of inorganic
pyrophosphate (PPi), a key endogenous inhibitor of calcification. Therefore, the goal of the research we propose
herein is to use our mouse models in preclinical studies to develop safe and effective liver-targeted human
ABCC6 gene therapy to prevent ectopic calcification in PXE by replacing the mutated defective mouse ABCC6
protein. To deliver the normal copy of the human ABCC6 gene to the liver we plan to use adeno-associated virus
serotype 8 (AAV8) which has liver tropism and been used for successful gene therapy of hemophilia.
 We have identified ABCC6 and TNAP proteins as key regulators of PPi homeostasis. ABCC6 and TNAP
have opposing actions in maintaining extracellular PPi concentrations, the former generating PPi via release of
the PPi precursor ATP and the latter hydrolyzing PPi. We have generated recombinant AAV vector with human
ABCC6 codon-optimized cDNA and our strong preliminary data demonstrate that this AAV vector raised plasma
PPi levels in vitro. Based upon these findings and the known functions of ABCC6 and TNAP, we propose that
modulation of plasma PPi, either using an AAV8-hABCC6 vector, TNAP inhibitors, or a combination of both
approaches, represents an innovative strategy to prevent the ectopic calcification that arises as a consequence
of defective ABCC6 transport activity and PPi deficiency. To test this hypothesis, we propose to utilize genetic
and pharmacologic approaches to define mechanisms by which inhibition of TNAP elevates PPi plasma levels
from AAV-hABCC6 administration, and subsequently prevents and/or diminishes the ectopic calcification in a
mouse model of PXE. Our team has the requisite research expertise in the ABCC6-PPi-TNAP axis and
appropriate mouse models to complete these studies.
 We anticipate that the proposed studies will provide critical translational information from preclinical
approaches that will allow development of novel treatments for ectopic calcification in patients with PXE. If
successful, our findings will advance clinical management of ectopic calcification broadly, as PPi deficiency plays
an important role in development of ectopic calcification in other genetic and acquired disorders."

The selection of a prosthetic foot that best suits an individual's unique gait patterns and mobility needs is currently an
overwhelmingly challenging process. There are over 100 prosthetic feet available on the market, each with a different
combination of mechanical behaviors, such as forefoot stiffness, heel stiffness, and energy return. Adding to the difficulty,
the current prescription process in the US creates major barriers for patients to ""pilot"" multiple prosthetic feet, which often
results in most patients being fitted with a sub-optimal prosthesis given their gait biomechanics and ambulation goals.
Unfortunately, sub-optimal prosthesis fit can result in long-term complications such as low back pain, knee osteoarthritis,
discomfort, reduced community ambulation, and decreased quality of life. Prosthetists, the clinical experts that select and
align prosthetic feet to the socket, use informal systems based on both patient feedback and visual assessment of gait quality
to improve prosthesis alignment—but tools and techniques for quickly finding the patient-optimal prosthesis model are
currently not available.
To address this issue, this project aims to develop the Ankle-Foot Optimization Tool (A-FOOT), a robotic device that can
accurately and quickly replicate the behavior of any commercially available ankle-foot prosthesis. This new technology will
consist of a wearable mechatronic platform that will allow the emulated prosthesis’s mechanical properties to be adjusted
by prosthetists using a simple tablet-based app. Specifically, the app will enable prosthetists to make adjustments to the
emulator's heel stiffness, forefoot stiffness, series damping, and parallel damping, providing them with the ability to
customize the emulator's behavior to the specific needs of each patient. The device performance will be validated through
a series of benchtop tests, and by comparing the just-noticeable difference, or limit of patient perception, for
plantar/dorsiflexion alignment, forefoot stiffness, and hindfoot stiffness to values found with quasi-passive systems.
Additionally, a pilot n=3 study will be conducted, in which three prosthetist-patient pairs will work together to select their
preferred setting, and repeated testing (with random re-seeding of the start point) will provide a metric of prescription
consistency.
The long-term vision of this project is to revolutionize the prosthesis prescription process by enabling prosthetists to rapidly
find the optimal foot model and alignment using this robotic emulator, improving the quality of life for individuals who
have lost their leg, and reducing risk of long-term secondary complications. This proposal takes a major step towards
realizing this future by creating and validating the mechatronic system upon which this new future will be built."

One in four children in the United States (US) has at least one immigrant parent—more than a third of whom
came to the US from Mexico more than any other country of origin. Children of Mexican immigrants, in
particular those without documentation status, are exposed to psychosocial stress through their parents and
yet, nationally-representative analyses of how structural factors affect child dietary acculturation or obesity.
Mexican American children/adolescents experience disparities in obesity as compared to either their non-
Hispanic Whites or Mexican peers. The tapestry of state and local level immigration policy climates in the US
provides an opportunity to study their impact on immigrant families, both short and long-term. We will address
this research gap, by analyzing a novel data set of immigration policy climates linked to nationally-
representative data, to apply quasi-experimental and longitudinal methods. Aim 1 will study how the Illegal
Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act Section 287(g), a local-federal immigration enforcement
program, initiation affects measures of child diet and obesity in the year following implementation, as compared
to the same locality the year prior to implementation. Then Aim 2 will expand the focus to include other
immigration enforcement programs (e.g. Secure Communities) and types of immigrant inclusion/exclusion in
state level policies (e.g. public health and welfare benefits, higher education, employment, and identifications)
across 10 years. We focus on children of Mexican immigrants given their obesity disparities and demographic
importance, but also compare our results to children of other immigrants, US-born Mexican Americans and
other US-born parents. Anticipated findings of this work will advance our understanding of population-level
structural determinants of obesity in Mexican American children, before weight trajectories have been set or
comorbidities arise, and may inform public health interventions for this vulnerable population."

The transition to young adulthood involves navigating educational investments, job opportunities, entry into
marital unions, and decisions about whether and when to have children. Behaviors and outcomes in these
spheres are almost certainly shaped by levels of cognition, but we know relatively little about these links,
particularly in low resource settings. This project will provide novel insights into how domain-specific cognitive
skills that have a foundation in neuroscience are related to education, labor market success, entry into
marriage, and fertility for young adults in Indonesia. Data are drawn from the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath
and Recovery (STAR), a 15-year population-representative panel study of households and individuals in Aceh
and North Sumatra on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia, who were at risk of exposure to the 2004 Indian
Ocean earthquake and tsunami. STAR is representative of the pre-disaster population. In addition, we will
harness data from a specially-designed subcomponent of STAR, the Extended Assessment of Biomarkers and
Cognition (EABC), which involves two rounds of longitudinal data of a 25% randomly-selected subsample of
STAR respondents that includes a tablet-based approach to precisely measuring seven different cognitive
skills using game-like tasks adapted for the setting from widely-used assessments. We focus on respondents
who were between 8 and 22 years in the first round of the EABC (13 years after the disaster), and so they
were in adolescence and early adulthood in the second round (20 years after the disaster). We leverage our
cognitive data and the panel design of the EABC and STAR to provide evidence on the association between
performance in the cognitive tasks and key markers of the transition to adulthood. We will also examine the
role of parental and family background characteristics in the association between cognition and early adult
outcomes by adjusting for background characteristics and estimating models that focus on comparisons
between siblings. Finally, we leverage the fact that the tsunami was completely unanticipated, exploiting
exogenous local variation in the intensity of exposure to the tsunami to examine the role of a large
unanticipated natural disaster in moderating the relationship between cognitive performance and early adult
outcomes."

 This application, “Transfer RNAs as novel mediators in acute lung injury,” is submitted by Joseph S. Bednash,
MD for a K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award. I am a physician-scientist in the
Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine at the Ohio State University (OSU). I am applying for
this award for advanced training as a physician-scientist, studying mechanisms that contribute to dysregulated
biology in ARDS and critical illness. The primary objective of my research plan is to determine how transfer RNA
(tRNA)-derived fragments regulate host defense mechanisms in lung injury and to determine how TRMT1 (tRNA
(guanine(26)-N(2))-dimethyltransferase), a tRNA methyltransferase and putative upstream regulator, modulates
tRNA fragments to impact host defense. With cellular stress, tRNAs are fragmented into biologically active small
non-coding RNAs, termed tiRNAs (tRNA halves) or tRFs (tRNA-derived fragments). TRMT1 methylates tRNAs,
prevents tRNA fragmentation, and preserves protein translation efficiency. tRNAs, tRNA-derived fragments, and
their control by TRMT1 has not been explored in ARDS and other critical illness syndromes. I present preliminary
data demonstrating upregulation of tRNA fragments with bacterial endotoxin that promote cell death in
macrophages. Further, I show that TRMT1 prevents tRNA fragments and preserves host defense mechanisms.
 The specific aims of this study are: 1) Determine how tRNA fragments contribute to immunopathology in
ARDS and experimental lung injury, and 2) Define mechanisms whereby TRMT1 preserves inflammasome
function in experimental lung injury. These studies will provide mechanistic insight into the role of tRNA fragments
and their control by TRMT1 in lung injury and may identify novel strategies to augment host defense in ARDS.
To accomplish these studies, I propose a training plan to acquire training in RNA molecular and cellular biology,
training in microbial pathogenesis and immunology, and translational bioinformatics. To ensure success of my
training and research plans, we have assembled a committed mentorship team, including i) Dr. Rama
Mallampalli, Professor and Chair of Medicine at OSU, ii) Dr. Joshua Englert, an outstanding translational
physician-scientist studying ARDS, iii) Dr. Federica Accornero, an expert in RNA modification in cardiac disease,
and iv) Dr. Guy Brock, a biostatistician with expertise in translational bioinformatics. We have assembled a
Scientific Advisory Committee to lend expertise, provide oversight, and evaluate progress, including i) Dr.
Mallampalli, ii) Dr. Anuradha Ray, an expert in lung immunology, and iii) Dr. Ana Mora, an expert in mechanisms
of lung injury and fibrosis. My work will be completed in the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep
Medicine at OSU, an excellent environment for my career development. With the guidance of mentors, the
research environment at OSU, and support from the K08 Career Development Award, I am confident I can build
my skillset and research program to support transition to independent R01 funding in the next five years."

Diabetes technologies to treat type 1 diabetes (T1D) are rapidly advancing: continuous glucose monitors
(CGMs) provide data on glucose levels and trends throughout the day without the burden of fingersticks;
insulin pumps increase ease of taking insulin without injections; and hybrid closed-loop systems automate
insulin delivery by syncing an insulin pump and CGM through a dosing algorithm to allow for reduced user
responsibilities. However, despite these advances, use of diabetes technologies remains particularly low in
young adults (YAs) with T1D, and many YAs experience suboptimal glucose levels, which places substantial
risks upon their long-term health. YAs report the most common reasons for their avoidance or discontinuation
of diabetes device use include not liking to wear anything on their body, dislike of how the devices looks on
their body, and worries about what others may think. These concerns around personal and social perceptions
intersect a major developmental task of young adulthood: identity development. This K23 application, led by
Dr. Commissariat, proposes to address the potential challenges of technology use by applying a framework of
how YAs “incorporate” T1D into identity (e.g., through stigma management, adjustment to perceived
interference, and benefit-finding) in order to design and evaluate a novel intervention to increase uptake and
sustained use of diabetes technologies. The 3 aims of the proposed project are to: 1) Explore trends of
technology use over time in YAs using electronic health record data; 2) Identify core intervention targets
through qualitative analysis of the intersection between technology and identity; and 3) Create, pilot, and
evaluate the Adapt and Commit to CGM and Pump Technology (ACCPTech) intervention to enhance diabetes
device use in YAs with T1D. The primary outcomes of the ACCPTech pilot RCT are feasibility and
acceptability, and preliminary data will contribute to our understanding of how identity relates to device use,
and whether addressing identity challenges can enhance device use in YAs. These results will inform a future
R01 application of a fully-powered randomized controlled trial to enhance device uptake, use, and subsequent
glycemic and psychosocial outcomes in YAs with T1D. The mentorship, education, training, and resources
outlined in this proposal will support Dr. Commissariat’s career development and her goal to become a
successful, independent behavioral researcher focused on utilizing diabetes identity as a means to improve
diabetes-related management and outcomes in children, adolescents, and young adults with T1D."

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne emerging pathogen that causes severe and
often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans across a broad geographic range that includes more than 30 countries.
The NIAID lists CCHFV as a Category A priority pathogen, a biological agent that poses the highest risk to
national security and public health. CCHF is of particular importance to public health as there are no licensed
vaccines or treatments available for use in humans, and because of the concern that the virus could be used as
an agent of biological terrorism. The goal of this project is to advance the development of a recombinant vaccine
based on next generation vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vectors expressing the CCHFV glycoprotein as a
potential medical countermeasure that can provide protection across all six genetically distinct clades of CCHFV.
This application proposes to develop and pre-clinically validate a rVSV vectored CCHF vaccine. Next generation
Vesiculovax™ CCHF vaccines will be compared head-to-head with a prototype rVSV vaccine that has been
shown to completely protect animals against lethal CCHFV infection. Vaccines will be compared for
immunogenicity, lack of neurovirulence, and the ability to protect STAT-1 knockout mice against all six M
segment clades of CCHFV. A lead candidate vaccine will then be down selected. Supporting studies using a
newly developed lethal nonhuman primate model of CCHFV will be employed to confirm protective efficacy of
the lead vaccine candidate, assess the ability to the vaccine to provide rapid protection, and finally to begin to
determine correlates of protection. This proposal will draw together expertise in vaccine development, CCHFV
biology, and animal modeling needed to develop a vaccine that meets both the outbreak and bioweapon
scenarios that require rapid protection against all CCHFV clades with a single administration."

Individual differences in the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals are a significant barrier to treatment in pain
medicine, where clinicians must balance safety concerns, particularly around opioids, with the undertreatment
of pain. Pharmacogenomics aims to improve safety and reduce trial-and-error with medications by providing
critical information about an individual’s genetic risk for adverse drug reactions and medication failure.
However, despite institutional support for testing, studies indicate that pharmacogenomic testing is rarely
ordered for pain medication. To improve access to genomic medicine, we need to understand the reason for
this gap, as well as key clinical and ethical considerations to guide patient-centered use. This K99/R00 Award
is a five-year training and research project that will use an exploratory sequential mixed methods design to
improve our understanding of pain physicians’ knowledge, views, and practices with pharmacogenomics.
Physicians impact patient access through their use and interpretation of tests. Board-certified pain physicians
are an understudied group of expert stakeholders who undergo specialized training in the treatment of chronic
pain and the management of medications. Studies have identified system-level educational and administrative
barriers to the use of pharmacogenomics; however, these studies do not account for why some medical
specialties have adopted pharmacogenomic education and testing more quickly than others. Medical
specialties shape physician knowledge, views, and practices through fellowship training, ongoing
professionalization, and clinical guidelines. The specific aims are to 1) Characterize professional discussions in
pain medicine about pharmacogenomics using ethnographic methods. 2) Assess pain physicians’ knowledge,
views, and use of pharmacogenomics using a national survey. 3) Identify a) key barriers and facilitators and b)
clinical and ethical considerations to guide the use of pharmacogenomics in chronic pain care via a synthetic
analysis of ethnographic and quantitative data. The K99 phase of this grant includes a combination of didactic
coursework, directed readings, and clinical immersion to develop the skills and expertise of the candidate in a)
survey design, statistical sampling, and mixed methods analysis, b) pharmacogenomics of pain medications, c)
clinical issues for medication management in chronic pain care, and d) collaborative research and publications.
Through the protected time and mentorship of the proposed Pathway to Independence Award, the candidate
will be able to secure a tenure track position and to fulfill their long-term goal of being an independent scientist
dedicated to examining the ethical, legal, and social implications of the use of genomics in clinical care."
10865867,"Title: Adolescent alcohol exposure exacerbates rmTBI associated BBB disruption and dementia risk
Approximately 20% of adolescents self-report experiencing one or more mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) with
adolescent athletes being at a higher risk than non-athletic peers. Additionally, rates of alcohol consumption are
higher in adolescents participating in team sports. The adolescent brain is especially vulnerable to both insults.
Over the years, dementia has been linked to a variety of diseases and injuries, among them alcohol consumption
and TBI, with repeat mild TBI (rmTBI) believed to be the primary factor in the development of chronic traumatic
encephalopathy (CTE) a neurodegenerative disease that leads to dementia. Dementia is a leading cause of
disability and dependency worldwide, with an estimated annual cost of $1.3 trillion (US). One important brain
feature that is disrupted by TBI and alcohol, as well as being heavily implicated in the development of dementias,
is the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is an intricately linked cellular and molecular structure that maintains
homeostasis in the microenvironment of the brain by regulating the access of blood-borne molecules into the
tissues, and critically the BBB plays a role in the production and clearance of amyloid beta. Alcohol has been
shown to disrupt the BBB via a cascade of pathological events, such as the release of inflammatory cytokines,
accumulation of extracellular adenosine, and the reduction of tight junction integrity. While TBI initially disrupts
the BBB via shearing and rupturing forces of the mechanical injury, it also subsequently leads to a similar
cascade of events as alcohol. The proposed studies will use adolescent female and male rats subjected to a
series of four mTBIs interspersed with episodes of alcohol exposure to test the hypothesis that adolescent
alcohol exposure exacerbates repeated mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI)-induced damage to the BBB and
increases expression of dementia-related markers. Proof of principle studies will use pharmacological
approaches to examine whether alcohol-mediated enhanced BBB disruption contributes to the increased risk for
dementia."

My career goal is to establish an independent aging research program focused on designing and evaluating
high quality, technology-based behavioral health interventions to improve self-management and quality of life
(QoL) of community-dwelling older adults, particularly older family care partners (FCPs). More than 17 million
FCPs, including family, friends, and relatives, provide care for older adults with chronic illness in the US. High
caregiving burden places FCPs at risk for physical function decline, psychological distress, and poor health
status. Specifically, older FCPs are more vulnerable than younger FCPs because of greater physical and
psychological burden, more age-related health care needs, and less emotional and social support. Physical
activity (PA) has the potential to promote the health and well-being of older FCPs. Because caregiving duties
limit FCPs to the home and preclude face-to-face interactions (more so during the COVID-19 pandemic), using
digital health technologies is an effective way to engage older FCPs in home-based PA interventions. However,
there is a gap in research for digital health PA interventions targeting older FCPs; I intend to fill this gap. This
K23 award will provide me with the protected time to acquire advanced skills and knowledge in (1) design and
implementation of clinical trials in older adults, (2) physical activity behavior change, (3) expansion of health
informatics, and (4) professional development for a successful independent research career. The research
environment at the University of Colorado, the interdisciplinary mentorship team I have assembled, and
support from the College of Nursing provide an exceptional training opportunity. The overall objective of the
proposed study is to rigorously design and test a tailored PA coaching program using digital health
technologies, TPA4You, and conduct a pilot RCT to assess feasibility of TPA4You and its effects on health
outcomes among older FCPs. Older FCPs of patients with heart failure (HF-FCPs) will be the focus of this
study because HF-FCPs are an understudied population that is vulnerable to their own health-related issues.
The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) develop the TPA4You intervention by evaluating its technology
features (n=15; Year 1), (2) conduct field-testing of TPA4You to optimize usability and acceptability (n=20;
Year 2), and (3) conduct a pilot RCT to assess feasibility and preliminary effects of the TPA4You intervention
(n=62; Years 3-5). For Aim 1, using scenario-based design methods, we will elicit HF-FCPs' perceptions about
the integrated technology components in one-on-one interviews. For Aim 2, we will iteratively enhance
TPA4You to meet HF-FCPs' PA needs and optimize usability and acceptability. For Aim 3, older HF-FCPs will
be randomized to receive the TPA4You program or attention control for 12 weeks. This proposed study's novel
TPA4You program has the potential to increase PA, and improve physical function, psychological outcomes,
and QoL among older HF-FCPs. This proposal will provide the foundation for an R01 efficacy study of the
TPA4You program in a larger, more diverse population of older HF-FCPs."

Single-photon (1P) epifluorescence miniaturized microscopy coupled with genetically encoded calcium sensors
has allowed investigators to record the activity of large populations of identified neurons over days to weeks in
freely behaving animals, answering fundamental questions in neuroscience. Our group's efforts with the UCLA
Miniscope Project have allowed over 600 labs to build and use over 2500 open-source miniaturized microscopes
with expanded capabilities at a small fraction of the cost of those offered by commercial versions, thus
democratizing access. Yet, 1P miniscopes lack the lateral and axial resolution to image activity in fine structures
such as dendrites and axons. In addition, 1P imaging is limited to superficial structures or requires removal of
overlying tissue for imaging of deeper neurons. Two-photon (2P) microscopy has exquisite lateral and axial
resolution and bypasses all of these obstacles. Recent advances in technology have made the construction of
two-photon miniaturized microscopes for mice possible. However, the field of view (FOV) is still limited, and
these microscopes require custom-built optics and cost several hundred thousand dollars to acquire
commercially. We have designed and built a two-photon miniaturized microscope for mice, including a custom-
made objective lens, that allows 2P imaging of an 800 micrometer FOV nearly quadrupling the FOV from the
latest published 2P miniaturized microscope (Mini2P-V1). In this proposal, we will optimize this microscope and
test it in freely behaving mice for axonal, dendritic and deep somatic imaging. This microscope will be tested in
three labs. The Golshani Lab will test the scope with calcium imaging of thalamic axons in anterior cingulate
cortex during social interaction. The Silva Lab will test the scope by performing dendritic calcium and glutamate
imaging in retrosplenial cortex during memory linking. The Shtrahman Lab will test deep imaging capability by
imaging dentate granule neurons through an intact CA1. We will also build a larger miniaturized microscope
suitable for rats and non-human primates with expanded capabilities, including a higher numerical aperture (NA),
large FOV and temporal multiplexing capability to allow volumetric imaging at high frame rates (MiniMux2P).
This microscope will be tested by the Blair Lab to dissect the role of superficial and deep CA1 neurons of rats in
navigation. It will also be tested in the Churchland Lab to image rat posterior parietal cortical neurons during
decision-making tasks. Finally, we will disseminate the technology using our open-source wiki that has already
disseminated miniscope technology to thousands of users. We will provide parts-lists, optical designs and
methods for obtaining custom lens elements. As we have done before, we will educate users through online
videos and hands-on workshops where imaging basics, surgical techniques and analysis tools are demonstrated.
We hope these cutting edge, novel and open-source tools will allow investigators to extend their research beyond
that of what is possible with currently available technology."

10870005,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Prenatal alcohol exposure can disrupt normal development, leading to a host of pathologies that can include
facial dysmorphology, growth deficiencies, and central nervous system dysfunction. Compromised brain
development and reduced cognitive capacity are among some of the most devastating of alcohol's adverse
effects. Although alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders are completely preventable, 2-5% of live
births in the U.S. are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, with even higher rates among some populations.
Thus, it is critical that we identify effective treatments and interventions for reducing the adverse
consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure, including compromised neuronal plasticity in the offspring. Using
a rat model, we have found that supplementation with the nutrient choline can reduce the severity of
cognitive deficits associated with developmental alcohol exposure. These benefits are observed even when
choline is administered postnatally and after alcohol exposure has ceased. Specifically, we have found that
choline supplementation up to postnatal day (PD) 30 reduces the severity of alcohol-induced behavioral
deficits on tasks that depend on the functional integrity of the hippocampus. This proposal will examine
whether postnatal choline supplementation mitigates alcohol's effects on hippocampal structural and
functional plasticity, including adult neurogenesis and long-term potentiation, and if choline enhances other
experience-dependent plasticity. We will further investigate whether changes in functional plasticity are
related to choline-induced changes in long-lasting cholinergic functioning. In addition, recent data indicate
that toddlers and children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are not consuming adequate
amounts of choline and that dietary choline intake correlates with some behavioral outcomes. Thus, we will
also determine the effects of postnatal choline deficiency on behavioral development and hippocampal
plasticity. Elucidation of choline's effects on brain function and plasticity is critical as choline intervention is
already being translated to clinical populations. These studies will not only determine the neural substrates of
choline's actions, but also determine if combination therapies are more effective in improving behavioral
outcome. Moreover, these studies will help determine if dietary intake among children with FASD influences
cognitive functioning. Thus, these studies have important implications for the treatment of FASD."

Many students in biomedical graduate programs have negative experiences with their research advisors,
leading to worse well-being and lower success. Further, conflicts with advisors can be worse for biomedical
graduate students from underrepresented backgrounds (e.g., racial and ethnic minorities). Few intervention
programs have examined how to improve student-advisor relationships in an ongoing, sustainable way. The
current proposal aims to develop and test the effectiveness of a research advisor mentorship intervention with
two complementary components: (1) attribution retraining, to encourage advisors to perceive their mentorship
relationships as controllable and malleable in order to motivate them to improve their mentorship, and (2)
conflict skills training, to equip advisors with specific and actionable ways to manage and resolve the inevitable
conflicts that arise in these enduring relationships. A second goal is to examine whether a mentorship training
program can be successful and sustainable with modest time and resource investments, to facilitate scale-up.
Specific study aims are: 1) to develop, pilot test, and refine both light- and heavy-touch versions of a
mentorship attribution retraining + conflict skills training intervention for research advisors; 2) to test the
effectiveness of light-touch and heavy-touch interventions compared to a “no intervention” control group on
mentoring relationship functions and quality as well as graduate students’ program satisfaction, scholarly
productivity, and career intentions; and 3) to determine whether the effectiveness of either intervention is
moderated by graduate students’ gender or membership in an underrepresented group (i.e., racial/ethnic
minority, low socioeconomic status, disability status). To achieve these aims, iterative pilot work will be
conducted to develop light- and heavy-touch versions of intervention materials. Then the effectiveness of both
interventions will be tested by comparing them to a no-intervention control condition using a randomized
experiment with 270 research advisors at a large U.S. research-intensive university. Both interventions will
provide 8 hours of asynchronous content about attribution retraining and conflict skills training (1 hour per
week); those in the heavy-touch condition will also attend a live, weekly 1-hour practice and discussion session
(16 hours total). Advisors and students will be surveyed to assess any effects on the mentoring relationship.
Effects on graduate student short- and long-term outcomes will also be assessed, including their scholarly
productivity (e.g., presentations, publications), career intentions, and program satisfaction. Broadly, the project
will demonstrate whether a novel intervention for research advisors improves graduate mentoring relationships
and outcomes, and whether a light-touch version is sufficient to accomplish this."

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease with no definitive therapy yet
available. Emerging evidence suggests that defective insulin signaling in podocytes plays a key role in the
pathogenesis of DKD. In addition, the “final common molecular pathway” for glomerular degeneration contributes
to DKD, involving oxidative damage and stress-induced premature senescence. Glycogen synthase kinase
(GSK)3 is a critical transducer of insulin signaling, and also acts as a convergent point for myriad pathways
implicated in organ injury, repair, and regeneration. In renal glomeruli, GSK3β rather than the α isoform is
predominantly expressed and enriched in podocytes. Our latest studies demonstrated that GSK3β is hyperactive
in glomerular podocytes in clinical and experimental DKD, correlating with the severity and progression of DKD
and associated with accelerated podocyte senescence. However, the role of GSK3β in diabetic nephropathy
(DN) is extremely controversial based on very few studies solely relying on chemical inhibitors or activators with
specificity concerns. Preliminary data revealed that GSK3β catalyzes phosphorylation of p53 and p16INK4A,
pivotal mediators of senescence signaling in podocytes, and that GSK3β-regulated Keap1-independent Nrf2
antioxidant defense is a new actionable target for podocyte protection. Furthermore, GSK3β inhibition promotes
the expression and activity of retinoic acid (RA) receptor (RAR)α, a key transcription factor driving podocyte
differentiation and repair. Building logically on previous work, this project aims to conclusively define the exact
role of GSK3β in DN and test a novel hypothesis that targeting GSK3β in podocytes mimics or sensitizes insulin
signaling, reinforces Nrf2 antioxidant response, mitigates senescence, and synergizes with RARα signaling,
resulting in a beneficial effect in DN. Aim 1 will define the molecular mechanism underlying GSK3β regulation of
diabetic podocyte injury. GSK3β activity will be manipulated in podocytes exposed to the diabetic milieu and its
role in insulin signaling, Nrf2 response and accelerated podocyte senescence will be defined. Aim 2 will examine
the role of podocyte-specific GSK3β in DN. In mice with type 1 DN elicited by streptozotocin plus uninephrectomy,
or in db/db mice with type 2 DN, GSK3β activity will be promoted by GSK3β knockin or podocyte-specific GSK3β
hyperactivity, or inhibited by inducible conditional knockout (icKO) of GSK3β. The rescue efficacy of small
molecule inhibitors of GSK3β, including microdose lithium and tideglusib, on established DN will be further
evaluated. Aim 3 will test the synergistic effect of GSK3β inhibition plus RA on DN. Mice with icKO of GSK3β
and RARα in podocytes will be employed to determine if RARα contributes to GSK3β regulation of DN. The role
of GSK3β in regulating RARα activity will be defined using podocytes with differing GSK3β activity and validated
in GSK3βicKO mice with type 1 or 2 DN. The synergistic effect of RA plus GSK3β inhibitors on DN will be tested.
Collectively, these studies will provide a mechanistic view of the role of GSK3β in the pathogenesis of DN and
pave the way for trials of existing or novel medications with GSK3β inhibitory activities to treat DKD in men."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) remains one of the most intractable types of cancer,
with a 5-year survival rate below 9%. Alarmingly, the incidence of pancreatic cancer is on the
rise over the past 20 years, with particularly sharp increases in incidence among young adults.
Poor nutrition and obesity are likely culprits, with obesity and diabetes independently conferring
increased risk of PDA, but the mechanisms remain unclear.
Branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) have emerged as one potentially important link between
diet, systemic metabolism, and PDA. We have demonstrated in previous work and preliminary
data that BCAAs are avidly consumed by the pancreas, where they contribute prominently to
the TCA cycle and to acetyl-CoA pools. We have also recently shown that acetyl-CoA
metabolism plays a key role in facilitating pancreatic tumor initiation, leading to the hypothesis
that BCAA metabolism is required for efficient pancreatic tumorigenesis. Thus, one major goal
of this grant will be to test the role of BCAA catabolism in the pancreas in facilitating acinar cell
plasticity and tumor formation. We will use state-of-the-art in vivo isotope tracer approaches to
elucidate the fates of BCAAs in the pancreas. We will also employ nutritional, genetic (using
two novel mouse models), and pharmacological approaches to define the roles of BCAA
catabolism in pancreatic function and tumorigenesis.
In contrast to normal pancreatic cells, use of BCAAs as a fuel source is thought to be
suppressed as pancreatic cancer develops. Nevertheless, BCAAs are an important biomarker
of PDA, with circulating levels elevated years prior to PDA diagnosis, indicating a risk that likely
mechanistically differs from that of tumor initiation. BCAAs are also elevated in obesity and
diabetes, where they promote insulin secretion and insulin resistance, promoting a
hyperinsulinemic state. Insulin itself acts as a growth factor to promote anabolic signaling and
metabolism in PDA cells. Our second major goal is thus to evaluate the contribution of systemic
BCAA levels and hyperinsulinemia to PDA tumor growth. We will manipulate systemic BCAA
levels through nutritional, genetic, and pharmacological approaches to test the impact on tumor
growth. We will then query the impact of insulin directly on PDA cells and on cancer-associated
fibroblasts (CAFs), along with the impact of reducing hyperinsulinemia on tumor growth. Finally,
we will test the potential to target BCAA metabolism through mouse clinical trials.
These studies will provide deep insight into the roles of BCAAs in multi-step PDA tumorigenesis
and could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for this deadly disease."

Acquired infections after spinal cord injury (SCI) are prevalent, constitute the main cause of death in patients
and have been identified as a modifiable risk factor associated with poor neurological and functional recovery.
Infection treatment by orthodox antibiotics is complicated by i) spectrum/efficacy gaps, ii) early development of
antibiotic resistancies, and iii) failure of antibiotics to prevent infections when applied early in patients with
acute CNS lesions. Moreover, new evidence indicates that antibiotics can impair neurological recovery, due to
their ability to cause gut dysbiosis. Improved anti-infective treatment strategies are critically needed, which take
the immune-compromised status after SCI into account. Recent data have identified unregulated sympathetic
tone originating from below the spinal cord injury site (spinally generated sympathetic nerve activity, SNA) as a
major driver of the systemic spinal cord injury immune deficiency syndrome (SCI-IDS). SNA has been
identified and independently confirmed as a mechanistic target to restore immune function in vivo. Three aims
are proposed to answer one main and novel question: Can immune function and host-defense against
pneumonia be re-established with SNA-targeting immunotrophic pharmacological neuromodulation (IPN)?
Experiments in Aim 1 will use a novel combination of FDA-approved drugs selected to promote immune
system function and reduce susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia acutely or at 4 weeks post SCI. Aim 2 will
assess the capacity of IPN to normalize different cellular SCI-IDS characteristics and the sympathetic
neuroendocrine reflex. Irrespective of SCI, infections are well-known causes of dysautonomia, which is a
pathophysiological conduit for septic conversions. Aim 3 addresses whether IPN can blunt infection-associated
autonomic dysfunction and neutralize a sepsis risk factor. If successful, data from these experiments will
directly inform effective non-antibiotic anti-infective strategies for SCI patients to reduce infection-associated
mortality and disability."

around the globe but are underserved in the response to HIV. Nepal is a lower income country in South
Asia where trans women are a key population highly impacted by HIV. In 2019/20, we conducted an
exploratory study with trans women finding that 11.3% were living with HIV, and only 70% were engaged in
HIV care and virally suppressed. Discrimination resulting in anticipated HIV stigma and experienced anti-trans
stigma was a main driver of low HIV testing and HIV care engagement. HIV risk was further exacerbated by
anti-trans stigma resulting in barriers to education, employment, social support and empowerment. For
example, because most trans women faced discrimination in job seeking, the majority of participants in our
exploratory work did sex work for income and had high rates of condomless sex and many sexual partners.
HIV Interventions for trans women are needed that will have sustained impact by addressing stigma at many
levels that present barriers to health and wellness. However, few HIV prevention and treatment interventions
tackle intersectional stigma, and even fewer are developed for low- and middle-income country settings.
Building on evidence from our exploratory study, we propose to test a multi-level, HIV serostatus-neutral
stigma reduction intervention called Sweekar, or acceptance in Nepali. The primary intervention outcomes are
HIV testing and HIV care engagement. To increase HIV testing by addressing anticipated stigma, the individual
level intervention component is a tailored HIV self-testing intervention. To increase ART adherence by
addressing anticipated and experiences stigma, the systems level intervention component is HIV treatment
home delivery. To address stigma at the community level, we will conduct a contact intervention11 informed
by Photovoice12 to reduce experienced and internalized stigma. Photovoice will be used to inform content and
delivery of a social media campaign to reduce anti-trans in Nepali society, with benefits for increasing social
support and empowerment among trans women in Nepal, which will help mitigate internalized stigma. Our
approach is community-driven and non-randomized to maximize benefit for trans women in immediate need of
intervention, which is an essential practice to reduce health disparities. Feasibility is high as the US and Nepali
researchers have forged a strong collaboration over the course of more than a decade working together to
serve trans women in research and services. Furthermore, Covid-19 has created new opportunities for
innovations HIV care and prevention that will be leveraged in Sweekar. If Sweekar is successful, we will
immediately use the outcome data and lessons learned to develop multi-site R01 proposal to test the
intervention at scale throughout Nepal and in partnership with our Nepali research and implementation team."

Temporal bone research is essential for refining our understanding of the mechanisms of otologic disease;
however, the difficulty in accessing this tissue, the typically long processing times, and the expense have
contributed to a dwindling number of labs engaged in this work. In the 1920s, the first human temporal bone
laboratory in the U.S. was established at Johns Hopkins. The collection contains approximately ~1400 processed
specimens from donors with a range of otologic diseases that were obtained primarily in the 1920s through
1970s, but only a handful of studies have made use of this collection in the past 20 years. We propose to make
the collection more accessible to the scientific community and to re-establish the infrastructure for harvesting,
imaging, and processing new specimens with the intention of recruiting new donors from population-based
studies of aging in which participants have already consented to autopsies and brain donations being performed
at Johns Hopkins, as well as other clinical otological studies ongoing in the Baltimore Metro Region. We will
partner with faculty specializing in biological visualization, bilingual scientific communication, and mentoring
diverse scientists to develop inclusive outreach tools. We will also partner with Baltimore-based transcriptomics
resources to establish protocols for performing spatial transcriptomics analysis in nonhuman primate and human
temporal bones. We will approach these objectives with three Specific Aims: 1) Catalog, prioritize, and digitize
existing specimens from the Johns Hopkins Human Temporal Bone Collection; 2) Develop efficient harvesting,
rapid histology, and spatial transcriptomics workflows for new specimens and establish partnerships for collecting
specimens during autopsies performed on participants in epidemiological studies; 3) Education/outreach
activities to encourage other investigators to engage in temporal bone research.
The large temporal bone collection and the inner ear illustrations of Max Brödel at Johns Hopkins contributed
greatly to our early understanding of many diseases of the ear, such as the discovery of glomus bodies, the
histopathologic correlates of presbycusis, and innervation of the saccular maculae. The collection has also
shown enduring value, contributing to our understanding of the prevalence of a dehiscent superior semicircular
canal and arachnoid granulations as well as the role of melanin in cochlear and vestibular protection. Sharing
this valuable collection with other researchers while applying novel techniques in digital processing and
education will accelerate advances in and knowledge of otopathology. We look forward to reinvigorating this
tradition of excellence by developing a new collection, applying modern techniques, and integrating otopathology

10873307,"Miscarriage - defined as pregnancy loss prior to 20 weeks of gestation - is the most common pregnancy
complication, affecting 10-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. While advances have been made in
noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities leading to pregnancy loss, the pathophysiology
and environmental causes of chromosomally normal losses – the bulk of miscarriages occurring after the 6th
gestation week – remain largely unexplained. We hypothesize that microRNAs serve as a physiologic “glue” for
common pathways predicting loss of chromosomally normal pregnancies. MicroRNAs are non-coding RNAs that
negatively regulate gene expression by inducing translational inhibition or mRNA degradation. Because of their
remarkable stability in the circulation and their ability to report on or regulate cellular and tissue phenotypes in
distal anatomic sites, they present an attractive novel target for mechanistic and diagnostic biomarker research.
miRNA expression is controlled by a variety of exposures not yet deciphered in pregnant women. In our global
transcriptomics pilot, we discovered circulating miRNAs that are differentially expressed in typical pregnancy
compared to pre-conception and to pregnancy in women who later miscarry. This application responds to a
strategic priority identified by NICHD. We leverage the rich dataset of demographic, socio-economic and
maternal health data and the biospecimen archive of three large early pregnancy cohorts (>8000 enrolled
participants) and align them with technological resources offered under GLP practice by four participating
laboratories. Drawing on the largest sample of miscarriages ever examined in relation to prospectively obtained
biological data (250 chromosomally normal miscarriages) and building on the technological resources offered
under GLP practice by four participating laboratories, we will: Aim 1: Identify prodromal molecular signatures of
miscarriage, in pre-miscarriage maternal blood, free of common chromosomal defects: 1.1 identify miRNAs and
miRNA-targeted pathways dysregulated in such miscarriages and 1.2 test associations with gestational age at
miscarriage;1.3 determine whether hypothesis-driven biomarkers of deficient endometrial function, inflammation,
oxidative stress, hormonal imbalance, and coagulopathy/hemostatic injury are associated with such
miscarriages; and 1.4. whether they mediate an association between miRNA and miscarriage. Aim 2: Apply
omics in maternal urine to identify environmental exposures associated with miscarriages free of common
chromosomal defects; and Aim 3: Explore whether miRNA antecedents mediate an association between
miscarriage and elements of the maternal exposome, including chemicals, and socioeconomic and health-
related stressors. The proposed research will generate high-dimensional data for the research community and
open the door to novel predictive models of the adverse effects of chemical exposures in pregnant women. The
study is innovative in its focus on understanding mechanisms and environmental exposures associated with
miscarriage and may identify molecular predictors and modifiable risk factors of early pregnancy complications."
10873308,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The CDC has identified Neisseria gonorrhoeae as a pathogen of the highest threat level (“Urgent Threat”) to
the US public health. Currently there is only a single recommended agent remaining on the CDC treatment
guidelines, an intramuscular injection of the extended spectrum cephalosporin, ceftriaxone. However, in the
past decade, reports of resistance to ceftriaxone have appeared across the globe. If one of these strains were
to disseminate widely, we would be facing an era of untreatable gonorrhea. Untreated infections can cause
serious and life-threatening sequelae. Thus, developing new antibiotics without cross-resistance to the current
therapeutics is of critical importance to public health. Between 20 and 40% of individuals infected with N.
gonorrhoeae are co-infected with Chlamydia trachomatis, a predominantly asymptomatic infection that can
have devastating long-term effects on reproductive health and fertility if not treated. Ceftriaxone is not active
against C. trachomatis and the clinical signs and symptoms of gonorrhea and chlamydia are indistinguishable
from one another. Therefore, unless chlamydia can be excluded by a laboratory diagnosis, empiric treatment
for gonorrhea typically involves administration of two different classes of antibiotics in order to cover both
pathogens. A single oral antibiotic effective against both infections would change the current treatment
paradigm, improving adherence to treatment as well as reducing the impact that dual antibiotic therapy can
have on promoting resistance in co-infecting pathogens and commensal organisms. Furthermore, as an oral
antibiotic, it would provide a much-needed treatment option to patients and physicians and allow for expedited
partner therapy. AimMax Therapeutics has discovered a novel antibiotic with activity against N. gonorrhoeae
that is comparable to ceftriaxone. It has demonstrated potent activity against multidrug- and pan-resistant N.
gonorrhoeae isolates, including isolates resistant to ceftriaxone, with no evidence of cross-resistance to
existing classes. The overall goal of this proposed FastTrack SBIR application is to develop a novel oral
antibiotic for the treatment of gonorrhea as the top priority, and if suitable, for the treatment of chlamydia also,
the two most common bacterial sexually transmitted infections in the US. The studies proposed herein will
confirm the suitability of this new class of antibiotic for the treatment of gonorrhea and chlamydia, identify a
formulation that delivers optimal oral bioavailability and plasma exposure to provide effective treatment, and
advance development towards filing of an IND. Rising antibiotic resistance combined with ease of
transmission, risks for outbreaks, and lack of second-line treatment options, all point to the critical need to
identify new antibiotics for the treatment of gonorrhea and expeditiously advance their development to the
clinic."

Mounting evidence suggests that magnetic fields may modulate important functions in cells. For example,
magnetic fields can influence the spin state of photo-generated radical pairs in many flavoproteins, determining
the rate of downstream reactions that govern cellular behaviors including circadian rhythms, DNA repair, and
navigation of migratory birds. However, only low-to-moderate efficacy has been reported in clinical applications
such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and magnetotherapy, to treat epilepsy, depression and chronic
pain. Improvement in treatment efficacy has been long stalled because the underlying molecular mechanism is
poorly understood. This lack of progress is mostly due to not knowing the molecular mechanism of magnetic
modulation. To measure the effective intracellular magnetic field to which biomolecules are exposed is the first
step of building such understanding. The intracellular magnetic field is likely heterogeneous and not equivalent
to the externally applied field of TMS or magnetotherapy, due to heterogeneous cellular compositions with
varying magnetic permeabilities, as well as the heterogenous dynamic magnetic fields resulting from ion fluxes
through ion channels.
 Currently no appropriate magnetometer exists to map the heterogeneous intracellular magnetic fields, though
cellular measurement has been attempted using nitrogen a vacancy-center nanodiamond-based magnetometer,
which can only provide sparse spatial readouts across the cell. Moreover, the necessity of subjecting cells to
microwave radiation during nitrogen vacancy-center nanodiamond-based magnetometry is potentially harmful to
cells. Herein we propose a genetically encoded magnetometer (GEM). GEM is a recombinant protein the
backbone of which is a modified version of magnetosensitive flavoprotein. We will demonstrate that the
heterogenous intracellular magnetic field can be mapped by expressing GEM in cells at unprecedented spatial
resolution without the use of microwaves. If successful, GEM will enable the mechanistic study of TMS and
magnetotherapy. In addition, it may also aid the evaluation of biological impacts due to pervasive presence of
devices emitting electromagnetic waves."
10873070,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) results from a complex cascade of events that breaks immune
tolerance and culminates in the destruction of synovial tissue. Both genetic and environmental
factors contribute to disease. B lymphocytes (B cells) play a critical role, producing the
autoantibodies that trigger arthritis. The Kendall lab works toward understanding B cells that
support arthritis development. We originally used mice deficient in the B cell signaling protein
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) to test its role in the K/BxN model of spontaneous autoimmune
arthritis. The studies indicated significant disease protection, accompanied by loss of
autoantibodies, with relative sparing of total IgG. In the course of this work, we made the new
discovery that BTK also affects the gut microbiome, commensal organisms that are thought to
play an important role in the development of autoimmune diseases, including RA. We found that
specialized immune organs in the gut, called Peyer’s patches, are very small, and that they
make low levels of IgA antibody that does not bind gut bacteria as well as it should. Further,
there is dysregulation of the microbiome that may have a protective effect against autoimmune
arthritis. The hypothesis underlying this proposal is that BTK-mediated signaling
supports mucosal immunity and regulates microbes that influence autoimmunity, to be
tested in Aims which: 1) define the IgA repertoire in Btk-deficient versus –sufficient K/BxN mice,
including features such as selection, clonality and evidence of somatic hypermutation, 2)
determine the cell-specific role of BTK in regulating the microbiome, differentiating between B
cell and myeloid cell functions, and 3) determine whether BTK expression and function in
myeloid and B cells differ in RA patients and controls, and whether IgA binding of commensal
bacteria are altered. This project has direct clinical importance in understanding how aberrant B
cells in autoimmune patients may cause microbiome shifts that modulate disease."
10873204,"Pain is experienced by up to 20% of the US population at any given time. Opioid pain medications are potent
analgesics commonly used to treat pain symptoms, but the misuse of opioids presents a major limitation for pain
management. There is increasing support for sex differences for opioid misuse among pain patients. Although,
prevalence rates for prescription opioid misuse between men and women are often found to be similar, this
finding contrasts with the consistently higher prevalence of abuse in men compared to women. For example,
male pain patients treated with opioids are more likely to increase intake of their opioid doses, misuse
prescriptions, and die from overdose. However, little is known about sex-specific trends in long-term use of
prescribed opioids for pain conditions. Sexual differences appear to play an important role in opioid misuse, but
preclinical data on how pain or prior history of opioid intake contributes to sex differences in opioid abuse liability
are limited. Preliminary findings from our lab have recapitulated the sex-dependent trends found in clinical data
using a preclinical model. Our data show that male rats self-administer higher amounts of fentanyl than females.
In addition, we found that persistent inflammatory pain increases fentanyl intake in males relative to females.
This suggests that inflammatory pain conditions lead to a higher misuse liability selectively in males. In this
project, we propose to investigate how pain alters neuroadaptative processes during long-term opioid use in a
sex-specific manner and whether these functional changes are predictive of maladaptive patterns of fentanyl
intake. The mesolimbic system is a key network node that integrates pain and reward. DA transmission in the
mesolimbic system, via the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), has long been
recognized for its role in reward processing and motivated behaviors. However, it remains unclear whether sex-
dependent effects of pain on opioid use are mediated by sex differences in the patterns of VTA DA activity. Our
preliminary data shows that persistent inflammatory pain reduces VTA DA neuron excitability by increasing the
inhibitory drive onto VTA DA neurons from the GABAergic inputs of the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg).
This suggests that under conditions of pain, higher opioid doses are necessary to trigger levels of VTA DA
release comparable to those produced in non-pain conditions. However, it is unknown whether similar
mechanisms underlie sex differences in the patterns of opioid misuse. Based on our preliminary findings, we
hypothesize that pain exacerbates RMTg-mediated inhibition of VTA DA cell activity in males, but not females
following opioid self-administration. This project aims to address this gap in our understanding by investigating
the sex-specific functional consequences of pain and long-term opioid use within the RMTgVTA pathway."
10873205,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 Listening comprehension is an important predictor of later reading comprehension, academic success,
health, psychosocial, and vocational outcomes; yet roughly 65% of autistic school-age children have poor
comprehension. Non-autistic comprehension of more social (e.g., narrative) texts is better than less social (e.g.,
expository texts) because non-autistics can bootstrap their real-world social understanding to better
understand the text. In contrast, autistic comprehension of less social texts has been shown in a small pilot
study to be better than more social texts, which is likely due to their social communication impairments. The
Construction-Integration Theory of Comprehension stipulates that a situation model (i.e., a mental
representation) is constructed through interactions between child factors (i.e., individual differences in a
child’s abilities) and text factors (i.e., individual differences across texts). Both linguistic child factors (e.g.,
vocabulary and morphosyntax) and social child factors (e.g., social communication and theory of mind) predict
reading comprehension in autistic children. However, these factors have not been examined for listening
comprehension in autistic children and have only been examined for more social texts. Text factors (e.g., word
concreteness and narrativity) impact comprehension in non-autistic individuals but have all but been ignored
for autistic individuals. The overall objective of this project is to investigate how child factors (linguistic and
social) and text factors (linguistic and social) impact comprehension in autistic children (9- to 12-years). We
will (1) Examine how listening comprehension of more and less social texts differs for autistic children; (2)
Identify child predictors (linguistic and social) of listening comprehension for more and less social texts; and
(3) Identify text predictors (linguistic and social) of listening comprehension for more and less social texts. The
central hypothesis is that both child and text factors impact comprehension and that social and linguistic child
and text factors differentially contribute, depending on the content of the text. That is, the linguistic factors will
predict comprehension across text type whereas the social factors will specifically predict comprehension of
more social texts. The proposed project lays the methodological and empirical groundwork for using a
precision medicine approach to identify and manipulate child and text factors for novel, effective
comprehension interventions for autistic individuals."
10873210,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Infections due to antibiotic resistant organisms (ARO) are a major threat to public health worldwide and
a significant cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAI). AROs are especially threatening to
immunocompromised patients in intensive care units (ICUs), where a weakened immune system combined
with cancer chemotherapy and antibiotic exposures results in increased risk for HAIs due to AROs. A potential
source of ARO transmission is the hospital environment. AROs can survive on objects and surfaces in the ICU
for prolonged time intervals, resulting in fixed reservoirs for ongoing ARO transmission to vulnerable patients.
To create and optimize infection prevention strategies, it is crucial to understand the link between the hospital
environment and HAIs, and to optimize environmental hygiene intervention strategies to prevent HAIs due to
AROs.
 To characterize the environmental areas with the greatest ARO burden in the ICU, our group cultured,
identified, and created a biospecimen repository of 1,109 potential AROs from collected from ICU surfaces,
patient fecal samples, and clinical bloodstream infection (BSI) isolates from patients admitted to the bone
marrow transplant (BMT) ICU. Our preliminary selective microbiologic culture techniques and whole genome
sequencing (WGS) data indicate that there is a genetic link between AROs isolated from sink drains and
clinical BSI isolates. This raises the hypothesis that AROs in sink drains are being transferred between the ICU
environment and patients (or vice-versa), and that the environment may be a reservoir for ARO transmission.
Based on these preliminary data, our goal is to define the link between AROs found in the ICU environment
and patients with HAIs, and to design and test interventions to reduce the burden of AROs in the ICU
environment.
 In this project, we will utilize antimicrobial susceptibility testing and WGS to longitudinally determine the
presence and transmission of AROs across the hospital environment, and determine the genetic link between
these strains to those causing BSIs in patients in a BMT ICU. Further, we will implement and measure the
impact of a bleach and hydrogen peroxide-based environmental hygiene intervention on the concentration of
AROs present in ICU sink drains. Completion of these specific aims will allow us to extensively characterize
the transmission dynamics of AROs across environmental surfaces and patients, and to evaluate an
environmental hygiene intervention that focuses on sink surfaces and drains."

Therapeutic hypothermia (TH), the only approved therapy remains state of the art care for HIE, despite only a
30% reduction in death and significant disability. Our limited ability to accurately track TH efficacy limits
identification of babies, who may benefit from adjunctive therapies. Under R01HD086058, our team enrolled
neonates with HIE treated with TH and tested whether circulating brain injury biomarkers used in adults were
associated with HIE severity, MRI and 2-year outcomes. We identified the novel biomarkers significantly
associated with the proposed outcomes and published 22 peer-reviewed original, high-impact manuscripts.
Our team has extensive experience in biomarkers in children (1R01HL150070), brain injury biomarkers in HIE
(U01 NS114144) and real-time machine learning integrating within health systems (R61HD105591). Our
central hypothesis is that a holistic and integrative approach, including deep clinical and community-based
data, and molecular biomarkers of multiple biologic pathways, analyzed using a fully connected parsimonious
neural network will best describe relationships with longitudinal outcomes, and be able to predict response to
TH in individual patients. Our outstanding group of investigators from Johns Hopkins University, University of
Virginia and University of Alabama Birmingham, propose the following Aims: Aim 1a. Perform clinical data-
driven modeling to ascertain TH effectiveness. We will use deep phenotyping data sets of all maternal,
neonatal, community-based, and follow-up data collected retrospectively (2016-2021) and prospectively thru
year 1, from neonates treated with TH at the 3 centers (n = 500) to model TH efficacy using multivariable
methods against longitudinal outcomes. Aim 1b. Identify novel molecular signatures for HIE insult severity
which predict response to TH. Using our discovery (N=178) TH treated HIE cohort, we will determine if
circulating brain injury proteins, metabolites and exosome proteins and nucleic acids are associated with TH
efficacy. Aim 1c. Determine relationships emerging from integration between clinical, community-based, and
molecular markers using a fully connected parsimonious neural network approach. 1C.1 Use computational
simulations to identify the levers, modifiable risk factors and interventions associated with the probability of
negative outcomes, in the neural network, and 1C.2 Determine in silico whether optimization of the neural
network using those levers at the individual patient level, results in a reduction in the predicted probability of
negative outcomes. Aim 2. External validation of neural network and estimation of potential clinical gain
achievable by optimization of the neural network, in prospective patients (Years 2-5). Completion of our aims
will identify the clinical, socioeconomic, and molecular mechanisms driving clinical heterogeneity in HIE and
response to TH. We will then be poised to rapidly deploy a dynamic, precision-based model to optimized
patient selection for future HIE adjunctive therapies."

The goal of this predoctoral “Chemical Physiology Training” program (CPT) is to recruit and train a diverse
pool of students to develop the technical and professional skills needed to apply chemical biology tools and
methods to whole-animal and human studies in a safe, ethically responsible and rigorous manner. Students in
this program will be trained in both chemical biology and in physiology and will learn how and when to build
research teams with complementary expertise. Development of the CPT program is facilitated by a number of
changes to modernize OHSU's graduate programs' structure and curriculum using evidence-based practices.
The overall goals of these changes are to individualize graduate training according to each students scientific
and career interests, allow for just-in-time training in technical, operational, and professional skills, and aim
towards a time-to-degree appropriate with the future career goals of each graduate. This proposal builds on the
success of our Program in Biomedical Sciences (PBMS) and Neuroscience Graduate Program (NGP) and
takes advantage of the recent growth in Chemical Biology and Physiology across many departments at OHSU.
Students will be pulled from both the PMCB and NGP graduate programs. The administrative and mentorship
structures for those graduate programs will remain in place, while the new hub structure will facilitate
successful cross training of students and post-docs in an interdisciplinary learning community. We are
requesting 6 slots from NIGMS, which will be used to fund 3 students in years 2 and 3 of their graduate
training. OHSU and the Steinberg endowment for training in Physiology will fund an additional 3 slots/year.
Students will complete required coursework for their degree granting program and research rotations in year 1.
Students appointed to CPT will be required to select the following PBMS and NGP electives: Chemical Biology
Innovators, Principles of Physiology, Drug Discovery & Development (pharmacokinetics), Receptor
Pharmacology (pharmacodynamics), and the new course Interface of Chemistry & Physiology. Students will
take some of these courses during year 1 and then upon acceptance into CPT they will take the additional
courses in year 2. These classes, together with courses addressing quantitative analysis and statistics, rigor
and reproducibility, and the responsible conduct of research provide the academic core of the training program.
They are supplemented with journal clubs, seminars, and a full array of professional development courses and
activities. Students will develop a working knowledge of both chemical biology and physiology and will develop
deep expertise in one discipline. Students will receive training and mentoring in research project development,
written and verbal communication, and exposure to an array of job opportunities that utilize those skills. The 33
training faculty come from across OHSU, representing multiple departments, institutes, and schools. We aim to
grow by attracting and fostering a diverse group of students and faculty, and have implemented several
approaches to foster pipeline development and reach out to a diverse group of students."
10870829,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and disorders of voiding are among the most common reasons for referral
to the urologist and affect ~20% of school-aged children. LUTS can be caused by one of several different LUT
conditions, including voiding postponement, and the prevalence of these conditions varies by sex.
Neuropsychiatric comorbidities, especially depression and anxiety, occur in 20-40% of children with LUTS and
school bullying can lead to bladder holding. Despite the known sex differences in terms of psychosocial factors
and underlying LUTS etiology, almost all basic science research on LUTS and stress is limited by male only
animal models. Chronic social defeat stress (SDS) in male mice leads to a voiding phenotype similar to that seen
in children with voiding postponement, as well as to increased expression of the stress neuropeptide corticotropin
releasing hormone (CRH) in Barrington's nucleus (BN), the brainstem region considered the voiding “command
center.” Data from the candidate's NIDDK K08 aims identified a sexual dimorphism in voiding phenotype
changes when the CRH neurons in BN are stimulated: female mice bladder sizes increase ~2x the amount seen
in males. These clinical and basic science data fuel this R03's central hypotheses: that SDS will induce sex-
specific voiding, bladder, and brain phenotypes and that gonadal hormones are required for these changes. The
proposed research is an extension of the candidate's K08 grant conducted in primary mentor Dr. Stephen
Zderic's laboratory using mice and will facilitate the candidate's research independence. In Aim 1, we will
establish sex-specific effects of a novel chronic non-discriminatory social defeat stress (CNSDS) paradigm on
bladder voiding, histology, and contractility, and on neurohormone and receptor expression in BN, a brain region
that the candidate has studied extensively in his K08 grant. Through collaboration with Drs. Eisch and Yun
(CHOP neuroscientists), the candidate will gain new skillsets in chronic social defeat stress models and
behavioral assays in mice. CNSDS allows study of both male and female mice exposed to identical stress and
will help overcome the knowledge gap that exists on sex-specific SDS effects on LUT dysfunction. In Aim 2, we
will determine the effects of gonadectomy in female and male mice on CNSDS susceptibility to bladder and brain
changes. Female and male mice will undergo gonadectomy prior to CNSDS followed by bladder and brain
measures as in Aim 1. Successful completion of these Aims will result in the first characterization of an altered
voiding phenotype in socially-stressed female mice, allow direct comparison with male mice, define
neurohormone changes in BN, and reveal if gonadal hormones play a role in sex-specific stress-induced bladder
voiding phenotype. As such, the data lay critical groundwork for future translational assessment of sex-specific
LUTS and their personalized treatment in clinical populations. As a supplement to the candidate's K08 grant,
these aims will provide preliminary data to help launch an R01 application and formalize collaborations with Drs.
Eisch and Yun, who will support the candidate's research independence."
10876272,"Our recent studies have demonstrated that that activation of GABAergic MC4R neurons in the DRN increases
feeding (Nectow et al., 2017; Bruschetta et al., 2020), thus suggesting that contrary to MC4R neurons located in
the PVN, DRN GABAergic MC4R neurons are inhibited by its ligand, a-MSH. In support of this, we have observed
that injection of a-MSH in the DRN reduces food intake (Bruschetta et al., 2020) and reduces DRN neuronal
activation (Bruschetta et al., 2020) in overnight fasted mice. In agreement with these data, DREADD inhibition
of DRN MC4R neurons reduces feeding in overnight fasted mice (Bruschetta et al., 2020) while DREADD
activation of DRN MC4R neurons increases feeding in overnight fed mice (Bruschetta et al., 2020). Furthermore,
bath application of a-MSH in DRN slice leads to hyperpolarization of MC4R neurons (Bruschetta et al., 2020)
and a significant decreased of frequency of action potentials in DRN GABAerigic neurons (Nectow et al., 2017).
Contrary to our published data, however, a recent study (Han et al., 2021) has reported that activation of MC4R
neurons in the DRN does not affect feeding while induce decreased body weight by increasing energy
expenditure and thermogenesis. While in this study the authors showed that activation of these MC4R neurons
induced glutamate release, our studies found that the majority of the MC4R neurons are GABAergic in nature
and their inhibition affects feeding, thus suggesting the existence of at least two DRN MC4R neuronal
subpopulations, i.e. GABAergic vs glutamatergic MC4R neurons, with distinct roles in the regulation of
metabolism. Notably, we have also found a significant increase in a-MSH immunoreactivity in the DRN of diet-
induced obese (DIO) mice compared to standard chow-fed (SD) mice, suggesting a possible role for DRN
melanocortin signaling in the development of diet-induced obesity. Thus, based on these data, we hypothesize
that melanocortin signaling in the DRN plays a role in the regulation of metabolism (Nectow et al., 2017;
Bruschetta et al., 2020) through the activity of 2 distinct MC4R subpopulations, GABAergic and
glutamatergic MC4R neurons.
In Aim 1 we will determine and compare the role of melanocortin signaling in DRN GABAergic neurons versus
DRN glutamatergic neurons in the regulation of feeding and metabolism by affecting pharmacologically and
genetically GABAergic and glutamatergic MC4R neurons. In Aim 2 we will profile POMC (and AgRP) projections
to the DRN GABAergic and glutamatergic MC4R neuronal subpopulations and the intracellular signaling
pathways in DRN (and PVN) GABAergic and glutamatergic MC4R neurons. In Aim 3 we will interrogate the role
of DRN melanocortin signaling in diet-induced obesity.
 The proposed studies are a logical extension of our preliminary data and, their completion will unmask a
novel mechanistic principle in the central regulation of metabolism."
10876394,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chaperone proteins are critical for cell survival and provide pathways for correct protein folding within the cell.
Our research focuses on ATP-dependent chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum, specifically Grp94. Grp94
belongs to the highly conserved Hsp90 superfamily, and like its cytosolic and mitochondrial paralogs, it folds
and activates specific client proteins. Grp94 is of fundamental interest because it has limited mechanistic
information compared to other paralogs. Grp94 is also unique because it has several observed structural and
functional differences from paralogs that make it a promising drug target. Despite the importance of Grp94
chaperoning in protein homeostasis, the fundamental details of its chaperone cycle are not well characterized.
Grp94 is of practical interest since aberrant protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum results in medical
issues such as type 2 diabetes, cancer, hepatitis B & C, and neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases.
Understanding Grp94’s structure and function will provide a foundation for understanding how diseases caused
by misfolded ER proteins can be treated and prevented. This fundamental knowledge of Grp94 mechanisms
can aid in rational drug design. Current strategies involve ATP-competitive inhibitors that target all Hsp90
paralogs and inhibit both productive and unproductive chaperone activity, which results in toxicity. Novel
therapeutic strategies include inhibiting chaperoning of toxic proteins while retaining chaperoning of non-toxic
proteins and targeting specific Hsp90 paralogs; however, mechanistic information is required to move the field
in this direction. Therefore, the studies of this chaperone mechanism will be of immense practical and
economical value in the development of disease therapies. Understanding the conformational changes
involved in the chaperone cycle is fundamentally important for identifying points of intervention. Understanding
how client proteins and other chaperones structurally and functionally interact is fundamentally important for
designing competitive modulators of Grp94.
My lab will develop novel techniques for functional and structural studies of Grp94. We will tightly couple
experimental and computational studies, which is a powerful combination of tools that will enable us to
elucidate molecular details that wouldn’t be possible to obtain with either method individually. Using this
approach, we will answer the following pertinent biological questions: (1) What are the preferred
conformational states of Grp94 and which conformations co-exist in equilibrium? (2) How do cellular conditions
and interactors influence Grp94’s conformational sampling? (3) What type of chaperone activity does Grp94
demonstrate and what are the requirements? (4) Where do client proteins interact on Grp94? (5) Are ATP
hydrolysis events in the Grp94 dimer symmetric or asymmetric? The successful completion of these studies is
expected to have an important impact in deconvoluting the Grp94 chaperone mechanism, the structural
changes involved, and the details of substrate protein interactions and processing. This information will
facilitate in finding new and novel points of intervention to ameliorate disease."
10876396,"Project Summary/Abstract
This proposal describes the development of tools that will be applied to robustly investigate the role of
circadian rhythms in tissue engineering for the first time by: synchronizing rhythms in vitro; reinstating absent
rhythms locally in regenerating sites in vivo; and aligning therapeutic delivery to distinct circadian phases. Our
lab focuses on timing as a tool in tissue engineering, whereby we use therapeutic signals to co-ordinate
various phases of repair over the time scale of days. But, 24 hr circadian rhythms – which play critical roles in
biological systems (e.g., tissue formation, cell signaling, cell activity) – are ignored in tissue engineering studies
and product development. For example, in current tissue engineering cell cultures individual cells have a
circadian rhythm, but they rapidly fall out of synch with other cells in the culture, eliminating rhythmic processes
that would occur in the natural system. Indeed, patient populations with disrupted circadian rhythms (e.g.,
diabetes, obesity) also have poor tissue regeneration and they are the target of many tissue engineering
strategies. Yet, nobody has considered this lack of rhythmicity in developing tissue engineering strategies.
From the therapeutic timing perspective, there is strong evidence in many diseases that the efficacy of
systemically delivered drugs is strongly affected by the time of day. In local tissue regenerating sites, it is highly
probable that there are also optimum circadian times for therapeutic delivery, which needs to be investigated.
In the next five years we will begin to fill these gaps in tissue engineering research laying the groundwork for
an unexplored approach that can be harnessed to optimize tissue regeneration. First, this work will impart the
currently absent circadian rhythms into in vitro tissue engineering studies of skin, bone, and vascularization.
This will be accomplished using a robotics device that interfaces with standard tissue culture setups to provide
synchronizing signals (e.g., glucocorticoids, temperature) at precise timepoints. Interestingly, glucocorticoid
rhythms are altered in patient populations with poor regeneration (e.g., obesity, diabetes) but synthetic
glucocorticoids given systemically can reinstate circadian rhythms. In a first-of-its-kind approach, we will test
the ability to drive local circadian rhythms at a regenerating site via glucocorticoid signaling. To do this we will
develop circadian drug delivery systems based on ultrasound- or light-triggered release that are capable of
precisely timed daily local delivery of glucocorticoids. The automated tools and circadian drug delivery system
will additionally be modified and used to demonstrate the effect of growth factor alignment with circadian
phases on tissue repair. This proposal will rigorously investigate the interplay between circadian rhythms and
tissue engineering, provide the tools to research and test these rhythms, and demonstrate how these rhythms
can be used to enhance regeneration. With this foundation, our labs’ vision is to lead exploration of this new
facet of tissue engineering, undertaking future work that manipulates these rhythms for regeneration of multiple
tissues, more deeply explores the mechanisms, and translates these new tools and findings to the clinic."
10880540,"Individual differences in negative affect are captured by a relatively stable, transdiagnostic dimension known as
dispositional negativity, which can be decomposed into two correlated subcomponents: anxious distress (AD;
reflecting tendencies toward sadness and anxiety) and irritable distress (ID; reflecting tendencies toward
frustration and anger). The goal of this proposal is to provide training in behavioral experiments, computational
modeling, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods that can be used to interrogate the
learning processes that underlie the subcomponents of dispositional negativity. Understanding the
neurocomputational basis of dispositional negativity is of central importance because it contributes to nearly all
forms of psychopathology and is strongly related to clinical prognosis, functional impairment, and economic
burden. The central hypothesis of the current proposal is that elevations in dispositional negativity reflect a
predominance of an inflexible Pavlovian learning system over instrumental behavioral control in aversive
contexts, with AD reflecting a Pavlovian bias to engage in passive avoidance, and ID reflecting a Pavlovian
bias to engage in active defense. Specifically, the aims of this project are to 1) demonstrate that passive and
active Pavlovian biases are differentially associated with individual differences in AD and ID; 2) characterize
the neural circuitry underlying AD, ID, and their associated Pavlovian biases; and 3) show that biases toward
active and passive defense are associated with common real-world correlates of AD and ID. Consistent with a
transdiagnostic, dimensional approach informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), 200 adults
representing the full spectrum of dispositional negativity and its subcomponents will complete a series of
behavioral paradigms that manipulate the influence of the Pavlovian learning system on instrumental behavior
in an aversive context, including a novel aversive Pavlovian-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) task. A subsample of
70 participants will complete the aversive PIT task while undergoing fMRI. Behavior will be analyzed using
frequentist multi-level models and reinforcement learning (RL) models that formally quantify Pavlovian
influence within a Bayesian decision theory framework. RL model-estimated prediction errors will be regressed
against BOLD signal, and structural equation modeling will be used to link AD, ID, and their associated
Pavlovian biases to real-world outcomes. The proposed training plan leverages a world-class research
environment with a team of highly skilled mentors and consultants to provide the candidate with training in
experimental learning paradigms, computational modeling, and functional neuroimaging methods. In line with
NIMH’s Strategic Objectives, the proposed work will describe the neural circuitry associated with complex
forms of learned defensive behavior, enable the development of clinically useful behavioral and biological
indices of dispositional negativity, and identify potential targets for transdiagnostic interventions."
10880543,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most frequent subtype of lung cancer and accounts for most cancer
deaths. Improved early detection has increased the number of LUADs diagnosed at earlier pathological stages,
thus warranting strategies to treat this growing patient subpopulation. Thwarting these advances is a very poor
understanding of early events that drive LUAD development and that thus would guide ideal approaches for
interception. While normal lung epithelia of LUAD patients were shown to display tumor-pertinent molecular
and inflammatory changes, it is not clear why a LUAD develops within a particular region in the lung. Whereas
the lung is ecologically rich with many cell populations that partake in both physiological and pathological
processes, we still do not know how the properties and roles of individual cell populations, such as epithelial
and immune subsets, co-evolve and interact to instigate LUAD development from a specific niche in the lung.
In our preliminary efforts, we found by multi-region single-cell sequencing remarkable evolution of the
properties and transcriptomic features of multiple cell subsets and states (e.g., protumor immunosuppressive
phenotypes) across macro-space, such that cellular ecosystems and immune cell receptor repertoires were
more similar among LUADs and adjacent normal regions than with more distant normal sites. Also, such
spatial properties were progressively enriched along the pathologic continuum of matched human normal lung,
to preneoplasias, up to invasive LUADs. Our preliminary findings motivate the hypothesis that geospatially
and temporally evolving expression programs, properties, and interplay of epithelial and immune cells
model early development of LUAD from the normal and premalignant lung. In Aim 1, we will study LUADs
and matched multi-region normal tissues with defined spatial proximities from the tumors by single-cell RNA
and immune receptor sequencing in conjunction with analysis of mutations in the tumors to establish single-cell
maps of LUAD and immune co-evolution in space. Spatially modulated cell properties and states will then be
used to feed and train a machine learning model that portrays LUAD development from the lung ecosystem. In
Aim 2, we will single-cell decode tumor-immune co-evolution along the pathologic continuum of normal and
premalignant lung to LUAD as well as identify cell states and properties that are modulated by early immune
intervention. We will use temporal information in mice, along with human matched normal lung tissues,
preneoplastic lesions, and invasive LUADs, to iteratively validate and fine-tune the performance of our machine
learning model to portray LUAD development in time from the normal and premalignant lung. At the end of our
studies, we will have built new models that reliably portray LUAD evolution in space and time. By providing an
atlas of LUAD development in an accessible data portal, we also expect that our study will offer scalable
roadmaps for the scientific community to develop new strategies for treatment of this fatal disease."
10880544,"Cancer remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Advances in next generation
sequencing technologies have allowed extensive profiling of the genetic variants present in tumors and revealed
daunting levels of inter-tumoral heterogeneity. Tumor genomic datasets have been extensively mined to reveal
germline risk variants and to characterize heterogeneous patterns of somatic alteration that drive tumor
progression. However, little attention has been given to interactions between genetic background and somatic
changes, which could represent a major driver of heterogeneity. New evidence suggests that germline-somatic
interactions are prevalent and our preliminary data support that some such interactions directly influence
individual disease risk and potential to respond to therapies. This proposal will develop computational strategies
to identify germline-somatic interactions and to characterize them in the context of molecular and clinical
phenotypes, enabling new understanding of their role in inter-tumoral heterogeneity.
Germline-somatic interactions have been challenging to study due to the limited amount of available data. To
address this challenge, we have compiled tumor genomic data from public sources to boost our sample size to
almost 45,000 tumor whole-exome and whole-genome sequences. Our analysis will focus on three major forces
that shape the tumor genome: (i) the mutational processes that generate somatic mutations, (ii) the molecular
organization of oncogenic pathways which determines the genes that can effectively drive cancer, and (iii) the
immune system which acts as a selective force throughout tumor development. We will focus hypothesis testing
with strict criteria for selecting germline variants and somatically altered genes likely to interact based on
established tumor biology. To identify and characterize germline-somatic interactions we will:
1) Elucidate germline variants affecting the somatic mutational landscapes of human cancers
2) Reveal germline variants that modify somatic activation of hallmark oncogenic pathways
3) Establish the role of pathway-specific variant burden in cancer predisposition, overall survival, and response
to immunotherapy
Our team of co-investigators includes strong complementary expertise in analysis of mutational processes,
genetic variation effects on molecular pathways and immunity, cancer biology, statistical methods and
bioinformatic software dissemination. Careful attention will be given to statistical considerations including power,
controlling false discovery rates, and validation in independent datasets. This proposal will produce A) novel
bioinformatics tools designed specifically to detect and annotate germline-somatic interactions, B) new
understanding of the contribution of germline variation to tumor progression, and C) a set of validated germline-
somatic interactions affecting cancer risk, tumor evolution and immunotherapy response."

Current clinical data show that there is no effective treatment of sporadic or any form of hereditary amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis. Our previous work and preliminary data show that two-level spinal subpial delivery of AAV9-
shRNA-SOD1 vector is highly effective in blocking the disease development or progression if treatment is
initiated in adult pre-symptomatic or early-symptomatic ALS mouse (SOD1G37R) or ALS rat (SOD1G93A). This
functionally-defined protection correlated with a high degree of spinal α-motoneuron, interneuron and white
matter preservation, and silencing of ALS-causing mutated SOD1 gene expression seen in the entire length of
the spinal cord in both mouse and rat ALS models. At present no long post-treatment survival periods have been
systemically studied as yet. In our proposed studies, using the SOD1G93A rat model, we will define: i) The
maximum duration of clinically defined treatment effect after subpial delivery of AAV9-shRNA-SOD1 in adult pre-
symptomatic or early symptomatic SOD1G93A rats. ii) In a separate cohort of wild-type SD rats and pigs, a SOD1
silencing vector will be used to study the toxicity threshold after endogenous SOD1 gene silencing. The aims,
research design, and methods have been developed to focus on mutated SOD1 gene-induced ALS, and to
generate comprehensive efficacy and initial safety data to support future pre-clinical development of this
treatment approach, as a novel therapeutic strategy for augmenting mutated SOD1 gene-caused ALS."

Maladaptive family environments marked by high chaos and violence, food insecurity, parent aggression and
lack of warmth, and parent mental health and substance use problems harm children’s development, costing
over $4.2 trillion in adverse child and family outcomes each year worldwide and lowering global GDP by 2-5%.
Maladaptive family environments are also passed across generations. One (mostly untested) hope of preventive
interventions in childhood is to disrupt cross-generational continuity in maladaptive family environments. We
hypothesize that intervention delivered to parents in one generation (G1) will lead to better parenting by their
children (G2) when they grow up to become parents, and intervention delivered to G2 children will lead to better
adjustment in their offspring (G3). This project tests intergenerational impacts of two different interventions in
which the original child participants have been followed into adulthood and are now parenting their own children.
First, the Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) is a longitudinal study of three representative cohorts of children
(aged 9, 11, and 13) living in 11 counties in North Carolina (n=1420), with oversampling of American Indian
children (n=349), followed into their 30s. Three years after the start of the study, an income supplement was
given to every member of the Eastern Band of Cherokees following a casino opening, creating a natural
experiment. The GSMS has documented positive effects of this income shock on G1 parenting and G2 children’s
adjustment as participants grew into young adults. Second, the Fast Track (FT) randomized controlled trial
(n=891) tested the impact of a targeted intervention aimed at preventing violence in high-risk five-year-olds
through comprehensive training of G1 parents and social-cognitive skill-building delivered to G2 children.
Random assignment to FT had positive impact on G1 parents’ interactions with their children and G2 children’s
criminal behavior and mental health through age 25. Over the next five years, we will measure G2 parenting and
G3 behavior at the same ages that intervention effects had been documented in the prior generation. We will
test GSMS and FT intervention impacts on G2 parenting and G3 adjustment, examine intergenerational
continuity and discontinuity in parenting and child adjustment, and evaluate characteristics that might moderate
intervention impacts and intergenerational continuity in parenting and child adjustment. This research will have
high impact on public health by (1) estimating the extent to which two forms of childhood interventions (cash
transfers and intensive social-cognitive skill building) can affect family environments and child outcomes across
generations, (2) identifying risk and protective factors that disrupt intergenerational continuity in maladaptive
parenting and child adjustment problems as potential future intervention targets, and (3) evaluating lifespan
developmental processes to inform future practice and policy decisions regarding promising proximal targets to
reduce risk and improve children’s healthy development."

The discovery of new potential drugs and biological tools is necessarily limited to the conveniently-available
chemical space. Historically, this space has been dominated by biaryls because their synthesis is reliable and
amenable to the needs of medicinal chemistry, where a core structure is diversified and built outwards by
iterative rounds of synthesis. Recently, cross-electrophile approaches show promise for providing convenient
access to more C(sp3)-rich molecules, a feature predicted to improve the odds of success in drug development.
Despite recent advances, cross-electrophile coupling of aryl electrophiles with alkyl electrophiles has yet to
realize its considerable potential. This is because many of the most abundant pools of substrates have very
different reactivity. We propose to develop new strategies in cross-electrophile coupling that address these
challenges and are adapted to modern medicinal chemistry approaches. This program's long-term goals are the
development of methods for the selective cross-coupling of every major class of electrophile and the discovery
of the fundamental properties that control selectivity and reactivity. In the proposed grant, a team of graduate
students and a postdoc will build upon the advances of the previous grant period to develop protocols to cross-
couple starting materials sourced from the largest substrate pools (organic chlorides, alcohols, amines, and
carboxylic acids), access more hindered C(sp2)–C(sp3) bonds, and shed light on how the nature of the coupling
partners and ancillary ligands govern success. Our guiding hypothesis is that these challenges can be addressed
by a combination of mechanistic studies, mechanism-guided tuning of catalysts and activating agents, and an
optimization approach that focuses on a collection of substrates rather than a single substrate pair. The specific
aims of this proposal are to: (1) develop protocols for C(sp2)–C(sp3) cross-electrophile coupling between the
largest pools of aryl, vinyl, and alkyl substrate pools; (2) address the challenge of forming C(sp2)–C(sp3) bonds
by developing new catalysts based upon nickel and cobalt; (3) study how ancillary ligands influence the stability
and reactivity of arylnickel(II) complexes to both improve catalytic reactions and to enable new types of
stoichiometric reactions for medicinal chemistry applications, such as DNA-encoded libraries. The approach is
innovative because cross-electrophile coupling is less studied than other cross-coupling methods and the
proposed mechanistic studies will shed light on these little-understood processes. The proposed research is
significant because the chemistry is increasingly important to industrial and academic chemical synthesis and
the development of nickel chemistry has outpaced our understanding."
10878454,"More than 35% of adults in the U.S. undergo chronic sleep restriction (SR) which is associated with multiple,
incompletely understood adverse health outcomes. Chronic SR is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for
bone loss, bone fractures, and osteoporosis. Night shift work and chronic SR in middle-age to older adults
imparts a similar risk of fracture as corticosteroid therapy. Our preliminary data in skeletally immature male
rats show that chronic SR results in marked osteopenia, decreased cancellous bone mass, and lower bone
mineral density—effects that are not fully reversible despite discontinuation of sleep restriction. The effects of
SR on bone health during adulthood are unknown and the implications for diseases of aging may be different
than for immature bone. The objective of the proposed research is to determine the mechanisms by which
chronic sleep deficiency impairs bone quality and integrity in aging. Our rat model uniquely enables us to
produce long-term SR under controlled conditions to allow age-related changes in bone to become manifest
in vivo. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that chronic SR exposure after
attainment of skeletal maturity impairs bone remodeling, resulting in decreased bone quality and increased
fragility. Male and female rats will be studied under chronic SR or control conditions for 10 wk (approximately
equivalent to 7 human yr) until 13.5 mo of age. We predict that this chronic SR exposure predisposes to
accelerated bone loss both then and later in aging. Therefore, a second cohort will be aged with sleep ad
libitum for 12 wk after chronic SR (approximately equivalent to 8 human yr) until 17.5 mo of age to compare
their bone quality and integrity to age-matched controls. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that sympathetic
nervous system (SNS) activation, which is a hallmark of chronic SR in adults, mediates abnormal bone
remodeling. We will evaluate the role of SNS activation by 1) directly removing neural innervation by surgical
unilateral hindlimb sympathectomy, with the contralateral hindlimb serving as a paired control, and 2)
systemically blocking β-adrenergic receptors (β-AR) that, in other experimental conditions, decreases bone
formation and increases bone resorption by actions on bone cells, osteoclastogenic factors, and metabolism.
Biomechanical testing of bone will provide functional assessments and will be complemented by structural
and cellular determinants of bone quality. Static and dynamic histomorphometry will determine the extent to
which bone formation, turnover, and resorption explain SR-induced abnormalities in remodeling. We will
elucidate cellular, hormonal, and molecular-mediated mechanisms in chronic SR effects on bone quality and
integrity. The studies are innovative because they are firsts in the fields of sleep science and bone metabolism
and employ novel interventions. These studies will define a biological role for chronic sleep restriction in bone
loss and fracture risk with aging and define the role of SNS activation in its pathogenesis. These studies are
important to public health because both SR and fracture are common and amenable to intervention."

 Direct intravenous delivery of gasses has been always considered an absolute contraindication due to
the fear of air embolism. However, if it were made possible, direct intravenous high content oxygen solutions
could ameliorate injury, improve tissue hypoxia and buy time for definitive interventions and/or prevent invasive
interventions such intubations. The basic resting minute oxygen requirements of a human are 3ml/kg/min or 200-
300 ml of O2/min. During CPR, blood flow is significantly decreased and oxygenation at the lungs is frequently
severely impaired. Both those conditions lead to vital organ and whole-body hypoxia. An effort to increase the
overall oxygen content of circulating blood could have significant effect on end-organ oxygenation even with
lower blood flow and could significant delay irreversible injury that leads to significant morbidity and eventually
mortality in this patient population.
 We have developed a method with which a highly pressured mixture of saline and oxygen can
be delivered directly into the vein at 1 Atm in order to dramatically increase the circulating oxygen blood
content. We utilize high pressures (50-100 Atm) at room temperature (25-28C) to dissolve large volumes of
oxygen in the infusate to make a clinically relevant therapy and sustain body oxygen requirements for up to 10-
20 min/L of saline infused. The concept is based on the simple idea that when the highly pressurized solution
(eg. at 50 atm and 25C the dissolved volume of O2 /saline is ~2.5/1) is released under constant pressure
through a nozzle that controls bubble nucleation rate and bubble size distribution evolution, a “mist” consisting
of nucleated nanobubbles and saline water molecules can be delivered, which can be directly mixed with the
returning venous blood. The presence of venous, unsaturated hemoglobin acts as an absorption sink for the
delivered O2nanobubble solution (O2NBS). An optimal rate of mixing can be safe and minimize bubble formations
through the process of immediate O2 uptake. Residual nanobubbles do not coalesce and therefore could
circulate uninterrupted through the circulatory system to act as an additional oxygen reservoir.
 In Aim 1 we will study the physics and engineering methods to optimize the solution and nanobubble
size characteristics under different upstream Pr/nozzle conditions. We aim to minimize nanobubble average size
to safely deliver it in saline at 1atm and 37C. Aims 2 and 3 will assess the effect of the intravenous oxygen
solution on blood and tissue oxygenation in animal models of simulated cardiac arrest and during prolonged
CPR. Finally, a large 72 -hour survival study will be performed. The implications to public health are self-evident
and far-reaching for diseases like cardiac arrest, hypoxic respiratory failure, emergencies requiring intubation
and anesthesia."
10881633,"Project Summary
 Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among veteran cancer patients with more than
13,000 veterans diagnosed with prostate cancer each year. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a
lethal type of prostate cancer due to developing resistance to androgen deprivation therapy and the new
generation of anti-androgen drugs (i.e. Abiraterone Acetate, and Enzalutamide). Therefore, there is an urgent
need to develop novel approaches for treatment of CRPC by understanding mechanisms leading to CRPC and
identifying new therapeutic targets.
 Aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a critical role in resistance to anti-androgen therapies and in
CRPC. In our preliminary studies, we found that Slit/Robo GTPase activating protein 1 (srGAP1) is a potential
Wnt target gene and co-regulated by androgen receptor (AR) signaling in CRPC. In addition, we found that
multiple components of Slit/Roundabout (Robo) signaling, including srGAP1, Robo1, Slit2 and RhoA, are
amplified and overexpressed in CRPC compared to primary PCa.
 Vice versa, Slit/Robo signaling can activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling by promoting the nuclear
localization of β-catenin via Rac1 activation. We have also discovered that srGAP1 interacts with guanine
nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) family of oncogenes Vav2/Vav3 that are known to regulate nuclear levels of
androgen receptor variant 7 (AR V7 and full-length AR) and the survival of CRPC cells. Based these
observations, we hypothesize that srGAP1 plays a critical role in progression to CRPC through reciprocal
amplification of both AR and Wnt signaling.
 To test these hypotheses, we will first test the hypothesis that srGAP1 is one of the required down-
stream intermediates for progression to CRPC and for resistance to anti-androgen therapies. Second, we will
assess the functional and mechanistic importance of srGAP1 on AR and Wnt/-catenin signaling and on
biological behaviors of CRPC. Third, we will determine pathophysiological relevance of the interplay between
Slit/Robo/srGAP1, AR and Wnt signaling and whether the expression of srGAP1 will be a good predictor for
disease progression and overall survival of CRPC patients.
 We expect to define the role and mechanisms of srGAP1 in progression to CRPC, which may lead to
identification of a novel target or prognostic markers for the management of this deadly neoplasm. Therefore,
our proposed work aligns very well with priority research areas of the Department of VA---Diseases with a high
healthcare burden in the Veteran population and Precision medicine studies focused on individual treatment
response."
10881634,"The number of women Veterans is rapidly increasing and expected to reach to 16-17% of the total Veteran
population within the next two decades. Furthermore, female Veterans are an aging population, the 45-64 age
group being the largest cohort. As female Veterans age, an increasing number are expected to present with
cancers. Gynecologic tumors constitute 12% of all cancers in women Veterans with ovarian malignancy being
the second most common in this group. Ovarian cancer predominantly develops in postmenopausal women.
Therefore, the incidence of this cancer is expected to increase as the population ages. Ovarian cancer is an
especially lethal cancer with none of the modern treatment regimens showing major benefits on overall survival
of patients. Our proposed research focuses on the development of novel oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
inhibitors for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Leads for therapeutics emerging from this work have great potential
benefit to women Veterans and is highly significant to the VA Healthcare system. Recurrent tumors, cancer stem
cells, and non-malignant cells from the tumor microenvironment engage OXPHOS for their metabolic needs.
Therefore, there is renewed interest in developing OXPHOS inhibitors as novel agents for the treatment of
cancer. We have identified a group of compounds that inhibit OXPHOS by interfering with ubiquinone in
transporting electrons from NADH and FADH2 to molecular oxygen. The compounds we are testing, citral,
plumbagin, curcumin, atovaquone and others, have an unsaturated carbonyl functional group that mimics
ubiquinone’s benzoquinone substructure. As a result, these compounds interfere in OXPHOS, cause rapid
increase in intracellular oxygen radicals that damage DNA, and induce apoptosis through the activation of p53.
Such ubiquinone mimetics are therefore candidates for cancer therapy. However, the OXHPOS inhibitors we
have examined so far, show poor potency and pharmacokinetic characteristics. In this application we propose
to employ rapid and cost-effective computational approaches to identify novel and potent OXPHOS inhibitors
with the goal of developing leads for treatment of high-grade serous ovarian tumors. In Aim 1, we will develop
and validate a data mining pipeline to identify potent and drug-like OXPHOS inhibitors from extensive assay data
available in PubChem public repository. In Aim 2 we will employ a machine learning model, based on previous
screening data, to guide selection of new compounds for iterative screening in cell biological assays reporting
on different aspects of the OXPHOS pathway. In Aim 3, we will test combination dosing of OXPHOS and PARP
inhibitors for synergistic potency and efficacy in ovarian cancer models. The methods developed here could be
applied generally in leveraging prior assay data to build models that guide iterative screening as a more efficient
approach than standard high throughput screening. The proposed studies should help us to identify the most
promising biochemical targets and inhibitory compound classes for OXPHOS-targeted ovarian cancer therapies.
Lead OXPHOS inhibitors discovered through our approach will be tested in future clinical trials that include
women Veterans diagnosed for high grade serous ovarian cancer."
10878462,"Project Abstract: PT4A (Peers and Technology for Adherence, Access, Accountability, and Analytics)
Medication adherence is critical for hypertension control and improved cardiovascular disease (CVD)
outcomes. However, medication non-adherence is a global problem. While numerous evidence-based
practices to improve medication adherence are available, there are substantial implementation gaps
leading to suboptimal adherence and adverse CVD outcomes. Macro-level barriers include medication
cost, lack of insurance, medication non-availability, and transportation costs. Poor patient-clinician
relationships and mistrust of the health system are micro-level barriers. We hypothesize that an
implementation strategy that synergistically combines peer coaching, peer-based door-to-door medication
delivery, and health information technology (HIT) can address implementation gaps and improve
adherence to hypertension medications. Peer-based medication delivery decreases the cost of
transportation and the opportunity cost of travel and procurement time and can be leveraged to provide
psychosocial support and enhance patient activation. HIT can support peer activities by facilitating
targeted adherence counseling, teleconsultation, synchronization of clinical care and pharmacy activities,
and analytics to improve medication supply. We have implemented a pilot program of door-to-door
peer-based medication delivery and HIT in western Kenya, and preliminary data indicate improved
adherence and blood pressure. However, the effectiveness of this implementation strategy is not fully
established. Therefore, our objective is to use the PRECEDE-PROCEED framework to conduct
transdisciplinary implementation research to test the hypothesis that integrating peer delivery of
medications with HIT (PT4A) improves medication adherence and reduces blood pressure among
patients with uncontrolled hypertension in western Kenya. Aim 1 will evaluate the effectiveness of PT4A
by conducting a two-arm cluster randomized controlled implementation research hybrid type 2 trial,
comparing PT4A to control. The primary biological outcome is one-year change in systolic blood pressure.
The primary adherence outcome is the pill count adherence ratio. The primary implementation outcome is
fidelity. Secondary outcomes are blood pressure control, self-reported adherence, and RE-AIM metrics.
Aim 2 will evaluate potential mechanistic relationships between implementation measures and outcomes.
Sub Aim 2.1 will evaluate if trust in the health system and patient activation mediate the relationship
between PT4A and the outcomes. Aim 3 will consist of cost-effectiveness, budget impact, and qualitative
analyses to help inform adaptation of PT4A to other settings. The research will be conducted by a
transdisciplinary team with diverse and complementary expertise. We intend to add to existing knowledge
of innovative and scalable strategies to improve medication adherence for global hypertension control."
10881644,"Lower respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of death worldwide and can be complicated by the acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.
Veterans are at increased risk of mortality from pneumonia so identifying novel mechanisms of protection may
help improve veteran outcomes. Platelet deficiency, or thrombocytopenia, has consistently been associated with
increased mortality in patients with severe pneumonia and ARDS. However, the mechanisms by which platelets
may protect the host are poorly understood. We have recently shown a role for platelets in limiting alveolar-
capillary barrier disruption and lung injury during acute Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) pneumonia in mice. We
further showed that PA cell-free supernatant was sufficient to induce lung epithelial cell death with features of
apoptosis as well as severe lung injury. Finally, we showed that released platelet factors can limit apoptotic cell
death in lung epithelial cells in vitro as well as limit cell death and lung injury during acute PA infection in
thrombocytopenic mice. However, it remains unclear the mechanisms by which platelet factors contribute to lung
epithelial cyto-protection during PA infection. The main objective of this proposal is to investigate the
mechanisms and implications of infection-triggered lung epithelial cell death as well as the mechanisms by which
platelets and their factors provide lung epithelial cyto-protection during PA pneumonia and lung injury. Three
aims will be studied. Aim 1 will investigate whether PA supernatant induces lung epithelial mitochondrial damage
that leads to initiation of cell death pathways, whether the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis that classically follows
mitochondrial damage contributes to PA-triggered lung epithelial cell death in vivo, and whether inhibition of lung
cell death limits disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier during PA infection in both wildtype and platelet
deficient mice. Aim 2 will investigate whether platelet factors modulate post-translational anti-apoptotic
pathways, examine the transcriptional profile of lung epithelial cells after PA-mediated injury in the presence or
absence of platelet releasate, and survey the role of candidate platelet proteins in providing lung epithelial cyto-
protection. Aim 3 will utilize development of a novel thrombocytopenic type 2 lung epithelial reporter mouse to
quantify the survival and proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells to determine whether platelets are required for
optimal lung epithelial repair after injury. We will also expand the generalizability of our findings by investigating
the role of platelets in protecting the lung during Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, which is similar to PA in its
ability to mediate lung epithelial damage with secreted toxins. By improving understanding of the mechanisms
by which platelets may provide protection during severe pneumonia, this project may help to provide rational
therapeutic strategies to improve morbidity and mortality of veterans and other critically ill patients. Furthermore,
this project will provide the applicant the opportunity to develop a scientific toolkit and academic portfolio to
support the transition to independence as a physician-scientist focused on veteran-centered clinical and scientific
research issues with the long-term career goal to become a leader in the Veterans Health Administration and
academic pulmonary medicine. The applicant’s research goal is to improve understanding of how the lung
interacts with and employs cellular and humoral elements of innate immunity to combat pathogens and manage
injury with the potential for translational applications in treatment of severe pneumonia and acute lung injury for
veterans and other patients."
10881652,"The Peachey lab is focused on the outer retina, to understand the biology that underlies the initial stages
of the visual process and to identify genetic mutations associated with visual disorders. The first research
area combines the power of mouse genetics with electrophysiological, anatomical and biochemical assays.
Transgenic, systemic knockout and conditional knockout models allow the expression of a target to be
manipulated and the effect of that manipulation evaluated. Some projects conducted during the most
recent RCS award (2015-date) are highlighted here: (A) To better understand the rod and cone visual
cycles by which photoreceptors regain sensitivity following bright light exposure the CDA-2 program of
Philip Kiser utilizes pharmacological blockade of known visual cycle components (e.g., RPE65) in mouse
mutants lacking proteins such as DES1 that have been proposed as playing key roles. (B) To clarify the
metabolic processes that support photoreceptor function, a recent VA Merit Review supported studies of
mice lacking the ability to transport glucose (by targeting GLUT1) or lactate (by targeting basigin) across
cell membranes of rods, cones and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). (C) To understand the role of
retinoschisin (RS1) we worked with a panel of Rs1 mutants to clarify the disease phenotype. Based on the
severe phenotype, a new R01 focuses on the earliest stages of development in the mouse models and uses
psychophysical assays to determine whether RS1 mutations result in incomplete photoreceptor
development. (D) Forward genetics is used to develop new mouse models for vision research, in work
supported by a subcontract to Jackson Laboratory. We collaborate through design of ocular screens, gene
mapping and defining the retinal phenotype. To date, this collaboration has developed >20 mutants
involving almost as many genes. Notably this collaboration has led to the identification of two human
disease genes, including CTNNA1 during the most recent RCS award.
 The Peachey lab has a long-standing interest in defining the genetic risk profile for age-related
macular degeneration (AMD). This began as a Merit Review in the early 2000’s focused on candidate
genes, an effort that developed into our serving as a site within the International Age-Related Macular
Degeneration Genetics Consortium (IAMDGC). During the most recent RCS award, the IAMDGC
published the most comprehensive assessment of AMD genetics to date. With the advent of the VA
Million Veteran Program (MVP), during the most recent RCS award we submitted a successful
application to conduct the first multi-ethnic analysis of AMD genetics. After defining an accurate ICD-
code based algorithm to identify AMD Cases and Controls without AMD, in the absence of gold-standard
ocular imaging results, we conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) in MVP for European-
American (EA), African-American (AA) and Hispanic-American (HA) Veterans. The EA GWAS
replicated and extended the IAMDGC results. When coupled with IAMDGC data and analysis of other
databases, we identified a number of new AMD risk loci. Perhaps more important, we noted marked
differences in the AMD risk profiles of EA as compared to AA and HA Veterans. A newly funded Merit
Review will extend this successful approach to conduct additional genetic studies of ocular conditions
that are relevant to the Veterans Health Administration based on their prevalence. In each case, we will
validate a Case-Control algorithm and then move to a trans-ethnic genetic analysis. For some conditions,
we will conduct the first analysis that compares genetic risk across ethnic groups. For other conditions,
this will be the first genetic analysis ever conducted. A better understanding of ocular diseases such as
AMD, glaucoma, cataract, or diabetic retinopathy is an important step towards treatments to slow/halt
disease progression, and possibly reduce healthcare costs."
10881654,"Project Summary/Abstract.
The overall focus of my work as a Senior VA Research Career Scientist has been to study the effect of
oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in age-related conditions such as sarcopenia and frailty,
and in the neurodegenerative disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). My research program is highly
relevant to the mission of the VA due to the universal impact of sarcopenia and frailty on older veterans,
and the increased prevalence of ALS in veterans. Sarcopenia is the progressive loss of muscle mass and
function with age characterized by a deterioration of muscle quantity and quality leading to a gradual loss
of activity and a decline in strength and power. Sarcopenia has a critical impact on the aging population
and older Veterans (more than 40% of veterans are over age 65) due to the increased risk of falls and
injuries, leading to excess morbidity and mortality. An understanding of the factors and interactions in the
mechanisms involved in motorneuron health, maintenance and eventual degeneration of the
neuromuscular junction (NMJ), synaptic function and degenerative changes in the muscle tissue itself are
critical to identify potential therapeutic targets to prevent or reduce muscle atrophy during aging and in
neuromuscular degenerative diseases such as ALS. In my most recent completed VA merit review project
“Testing the mechanisms by which NMJ disruption contributes to sarcopenia” we specifically investigated
the role of the neuromuscular junction and loss of innervation in muscle atrophy and weakness. Using
several novel mouse models to target deficits in neurons alone, muscle alone or in both tissues, we tested
whether alterations in the neuromuscular junction play a critical role in sarcopenia by modulating the NMJ
through presynaptic and postsynaptic alterations and measuring the effect on downstream degenerative
pathways in muscle. Key findings from these studies show that changes in the neuron are important, and
likely initiate changes in the muscle, yet deficits in both the neuron and the muscle are required to initiate
a full sarcopenic phenotype. Importantly, we further demonstrated that rescuing neuronal deficits
specifically in neurons in a CuZnSOD (Sod1-/-) knockout mouse that mimics accelerated age related
sarcopenia is sufficient to preserve neuromuscular junction and skeletal muscle structure despite the high
levels of overall oxidative stress in this model. These results suggest that redox homeostasis in motor
neurons plays a key role in initiating sarcopenia during aging and that therapies to reduce muscle atrophy
during aging may be most effective if they target the motor neurons. Another key result from the studies
in the past funding period formed the basis for our new studies that point to maintenance of cytosolic
calcium as a potential regulator of downstream muscle degenerative changes. We found that the loss of
muscle mass and function in the Sod1-/- mouse model could be prevented using an activator of the SERCA
ATPase pump that returns calcium form the cytosol to the sarcoplasmic reticulum following contraction.
We hypothesized that interventions to activate the SERCA ATPase and improve calcium homeostasis in
skeletal muscle or motor neurons can reduce muscle atrophy and weakness in aging. This is the focus of
my recently funded VA Merit grant and we are optimistic these studies will establish potential new
interventions to preserve muscle mass and function in aging veterans. In summary, the long term goals
for my research program are to determine the underlying mechanisms of muscle fiber loss and muscle
weakness with aging and to define the relative contributions of the motor neuron and muscle in NMJ
deterioration and age-related muscle atrophy and diseases associated with neuromuscular degeneration.
I aim to identify potential interventions to improve muscle quality and strength in older veterans and
contribute in a positive way to increased healthspan and quality of life."
10878070,"Virtually every form of progressive heart failure (HF) is associated with increased fibrosis. However, currently,
there is no approved therapy to specifically target myocardial fibrosis in the diseased heart. Until recently, HF
studies were largely limited to cardiomyocytes (CMs), primarily due to unavailability of fibroblast (FB)-specific
mouse models. The foundation of the current proposal is primarily based on our reports on the role of the GSK-
3 family of kinases in myocardial fibrosis. Recently, we used novel FB-specific mouse models to demonstrate
the opposing function of the GSK-3 family of kinases in myocardial fibrosis. Specifically, GSK-3α mediates;
however, GSK-3β inhibits myocardial fibrosis. Mechanistically, we identified that GSK-3α promotes fibrosis via
the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway in a TGF-β1-SMAD-3 independent manner. In contrast, GSK-3β directly interacts
with SMAD-3 to limit the profibrotic TGF-β1/SMAD-3 signaling. Herein, we are proposing translational studies
with newly created conditional global GSK-3α KO mouse and recently developed GSK-3α-specific
pharmacological inhibitor to determine if GSK-3α could be a viable therapeutic target for the diseased heart
(Aim 1). Furthermore, we will delineate the mechanism of GSK-3β mediated myocardial fibrosis regulation by
employing multiple conditional FB-specific KO models (Aim 2). We believe the proposed PeriostinMCM and
TCF21MCM are currently the strongest tools available for FB-specific gene targeting in vivo. The proposed
research is highly significant since it proposes novel strategies to prevent cardiac dysfunction and adverse
remodeling in the diseased heart. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to identify new therapeutic
targets for the treatment of cardiac dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, and subsequent HF."

The purpose of this study is to determine whether oral memantine daily for 6 months, when compared to
placebo, is associated with reduction in decline of cognitive function at 12 months in children ages 4-18
receiving cranial radiotherapy (RT) for primary central nervous system tumors and to correlate protective
effects of memantine with imaging biomarkers. Radiotherapy is a proven curative therapeutic tool in the
treatment of primary brain tumors. However, cranial RT results in significant cognitive morbidity. The
mechanisms of radiation-induced injury result in a picture that is a combination of the small vessel disease
seen with vascular dementia as well as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s dementia. Ischemia
and injury can induce excessive NMDA stimulation and lead to excitotoxicity, and pre- clinical data suggests
that selective blocking of the NMDA receptor can restore long-term potentiation and restore learning in both
models of ischemia as well as models of radiation injury. Memantine is a non- competitive, low-affinity, open-
channel NMDA blocker, which has been shown to be neuroprotective in pre- clinical models. In two placebo-
controlled phase III trials, memantine proved to be effective treatment for Alzheimer’s and vascular
dementia, especially for patients with small-vessel disease. Memantine has also proven effective in reducing
cognitive dysfunction in adults receiving whole-brain radiotherapy for brain metastases. Memantine delayed
time to cognitive decline and reduced the rate of decline in memory, executive function and processing
speed. Importantly, cognitive function in patients receiving memantine remained stable even after
memantine was discontinued; suggesting memantine had a protective effect rather than simply a therapeutic
effect. In this study, we propose evaluating the efficacy of memantine in preventing cognitive dysfunction in
pediatric patients receiving cranial radiation through the clinical trial mechanism of the Children’s Oncology
Group. This study is novel in that children will undergo early cognitive evaluations (baseline prior to
radiation, 3, 6, and 12 months post-radiation) with a brief computerized testing battery that we will correlate
with formal cognitive testing as well with long-term cognitive function (30 and 60 months) assessed with both
methods. If successful, this study will provide validated early cognitive assessment time points that correlate
with late cognitive toxicity and result in an framework for accelerated study design that will allow for early
assessment of efficacy for future neuro-protectant trials. Dose- and volume-dependent reduction in brain
volume is seen after radiotherapy exposure and is associated with cognitive decline. We hypothesize that
neuroprotection with memantine will also preserve relevant brain volume and this will correlate with domain-
specific improvements in cognitive function. We will use quantitative volumetric MRI analysis to correlate
protective effects of memantine with brain substructure (white matter, hippocampus, frontal lobes etc) volume
changes over time and correlate with cognitive assessments. Radiographic analysis will provide proof-of-
principle for the mechanism of action of memantine as well as a biomarker that can be utilized in future trials
of radio-protectants, which is especially important for young patients or patients not neurologically capable of
completing cognitive assessments but who may benefit the most from neuroprotective interventions."

 Medical treatments, including drugs, surgical interventions, and vaccinations, play a crucial role in the
prevention and treatment of chronic and infectious disease in older adults. Studies providing the evidence base
for the benefits and harms of these treatments include both experimental studies (randomized controlled trials,
RCTs) and nonexperimental studies (observational, epidemiologic, or, more recently: real-world evidence).
Nonexperimental studies provide critically important evidence for older adults, especially those with multiple
chronic conditions with polypharmacy, as such adults are rarely included in RCTs; this is doubly important for
racially marginalized older adults that are historically underrepresented in trials. Such nonexperimental studies
often involve confounding, and many confounders in older adults-including frailty-can be difficult to capture in
real-world data. Failure to adjust for this confounding can distort findings and lead to suboptimal or even
harmful treatment decisions (if nonexperimental studies are the only evidence available) or the conduct of
costly RCTs of treatments without benefits. Timely assessment of treatment benefit and harm in older adults in
real-world (versus experimental) settings requires development, refinement, and application of methods to
reduce confounding bias in nonexperimental studies.
 We have addressed this topic since 2005 with funding from R01/R56 AG023178 and AG056479. This
effort has led to substantial advances in methods to improve the validity of nonexperimental research applying
propensity score methods. Using both empirical data and extensive simulations, we have developed novel
analytic techniques to reduce confounding, including propensity score calibration and the exclusion of patients
treated contrary to prediction. We have disseminated our results in the form of oral presentations, posters, and
workshops/symposia and 112 peer-reviewed publications, including 23 in top epidemiologic journals (AJE and
Epidemiology), 23 in the top pharmacoepidemiologic journal (PDS), 10 in Medical Care, and several in top
medical journals (JAMA, JNCI, Diabetes Care, and JAGS).
 Building on our work over the last 15 years to increase the validity of nonexperimental methods to assess
the preventive effects of treatments in older adults, we propose significant and innovative aims that improve
the rigor of nonexperimental research. We will address these aims using motivating examples from empirical
data and extensive simulations to improve the validity of real-world evidence. We will take advantage of our
interdisciplinary expertise and access to Medicare data linked with other data sources to improve real-world
studies using propensity scores. This proposal is timely: linked data are becoming more available and the role
of real-world evidence in regulatory decision making is a central discussion point. This work will directly inform
clinically relevant treatment decisions, provide reliable evidence unavailable from RCTs, and improve individual
and population health for older adults."

Increasing prevalence of Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) is a growing health and economic crisis. Although
studied for 112+ years, the root causes for sporadic AD—which is > 95% of AD—are unclear. Over the
last 15 years, 415+ clinical trials to test new drugs against AD failed. Approved drugs can only manage
symptoms. I will use NIH Pioneer funding to investigate a novel hypothesis for the etiology of sporadic
Alzheimer’s dementia, based on my insight that imbalance between two innate immune peptides may
be a key factor that modulates the risk of formation, the stability, and clearance of AD-associated fibrils
and plaques. Recent observations of chronic P. gingivalis and Herpesvirus infections being associated
with Alzheimer’s fit this hypothesis. I am, to my knowledge, the only researcher working on this idea.
The human cathelicidin LL-37, unique in our proteome, is an antiviral and antibacterial defense peptide
deployed by microglia, macrophages, neutrophils, epithelia, B cells, and NK cells (to kill infected cells).
Thus LL-37 is a centrally important defense peptide, necessary for killing bacterial and viral pathogens
and infected host cells. LL-37’s Vitamin D3-, RXR-agonist-, and butyrate-dependent expression is also
stimulated by infection, wounding, exercise, and some vaccines (e.g., BCG & OPV vaccines). Certain
pathogens, P. gingivalis in particular, release enzymatic virulence factors that rapidly degrade LL-37.
Degradation of LL-37 could well dysregulate the brain’s innate immunity, causing neurodegeneration;
in LL-37’s absence, the immune process of macroautophagy is crippled. The Alzheimer’s-associated
peptide Ab now seems also to be a host defense peptide; brain infections by either Herpesviridae or P.
gingivalis stimulate Ab production, causing it to accumulate in plaques that co-locate with pathogens.
Recently I and collaborators showed that LL-37 and Ab are both expressed in human brain, and bind
each other sequence-specifically. LL-37/Ab binding prevents fibrillization and blocks Ab from adopting
b-type secondary structure. Thus, LL-37 degradation may allow Ab to accumulate. Our in vivo studies
show that cathelicidin induction in 5XFAD mice slows AD progression and improves 5XFAD cognition
to match wild-type. I aim to tie this finding to infection-associated dementia. In this Pioneer project, I
will use wild-type and cathelicidin KO mice to demonstrate that degradation of LL-37 by P. gingivalis
virulence factors may well be one cause of brain tissue degradation leading to dementia, which can be
prevented by early upregulation of cathelicidin to prevent infection; or treated orally with antimicrobials.
My lab has developed new antimicrobials that potently kill both P. gingivalis and inactivate Herpesvirus."

The Interdisciplinary Research Fellowship in NeuroHIV (IRFN) is a two-year research education program
anchored on the premise that our future success in tackling the complexity of clinical problems in neuroHIV
depends on the availability of researchers with the training to imagine problem-solving approaches that cut-
across and integrate multiple relevant research disciplines. To this end, we have followed an interdisciplinary
and translational model of research training aimed at bridging the gaps left by single discipline approaches. Our
program functions as a neuroHIV-themed Special Institute emphasizing interdisciplinary and translational
research through immersion into the vibrant research setting of the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program
(HNRP) and two main programmatic components: mentored research and focused didactics. Participants
receive close mentoring by experts in the field, leveraging the expertise of preclinical and clinically oriented
neuroHIV researchers. The IRFN outlines a clear progression toward independence in order to consolidate each
Fellow’s future success. Participants learn to approach neuroHIV research questions from an interdisciplinary
and translational perspective, with potential clinical applications as an essential end point of their work. In the
proposed renewal we will equally engage clinically trained as well as basic postdoctoral and early career
neuroscientists seeking to apply their talents to research on patient-oriented problems in neuroHIV. This serves
our translational goals by engendering “cross-pollination” of ideas. The research experiences of IRFN fellows
will be in the laboratories of high-caliber, nationally and internationally recognized neuroHIV researchers. Core
competencies will cover current thinking in NeuroHIV, from molecular to behavioral phenomena, general
research principles, research ethics, and grant writing skills. Essentials of good mentoring will also be taught
formally using evidence-based curricula. Additional didactics will center on professional development and
electives to enhance participants’ knowledge and individuation in areas of interest. Principles of equity, diversity,
and inclusion will be upheld across all components of the IRFN. Proposed for this renewal is the introduction of
seed funding for Fellows to conduct a focused, vetted pilot project in an area aligned with NIMH HIV research
priorities and the research themes within the HNRP, with the aim of facilitating a future extramural funding
application. The IRFN features: (1) outstanding faculty who have a long history of mentoring researchers to
become independent investigators, (2) individualized education, including research experiences that are tailored
to individual needs, (3) core and flexible didactic experiences, including lectures by leading neuroHIV
researchers, and (4) active evaluation and oversight of the program by a multidisciplinary advisory committee."

The United States Immunodeficiency Network (USIDNET) has been continuously funded as a resource for
Clinical Immunologists since 1992, evolving from single diagnosis registries to a panel of research resources
including a robust diverse patient registry with quality of life, laboratory, and clinical features; patient cell lines,
and a variety of educational efforts. In 2017, the registry converted the data to SNOMED and LOINC terms,
ushering in an era characterized by data standards and interoperability. The registry currently holds complex
phenotype data on over 5000 patients with over 3000 discrete data fields. Genetic information is available on
over 2000 patients. Under a new funding mechanism, USIDNET is poised to further enhance resources both
incorporating and improving the state of genetic diagnostics for Inborn Errors of Immunity. Our central goal is
to serve as a nexus of information on genotype and phenotype. The USIDNET registry will continue to serve a
critical need by defining phenotypes and propelling improved outcomes research with enhanced longitudinal
data. This evolution renders additional technical innovations possible in a manner that will serve community
needs identified through discussion and a survey. This Program has six Aims which all derive from the central
registry effort. The new registry will be anchored by a semi-automated data extraction from participating sites
to maximize data standardization and longitudinal collection. Input of genetic data will be standardized and we
will offer next generation sequencing to patients who otherwise cannot have sequencing, to improve the
richness of genetic data in USIDNET and to nucleate a “matchmaking” effort. The six Aims are interwoven to
support improved data and utilization. In Aim 1, we will improve the registry by developing a protocol for direct
data extraction that can be shared across institutions and instituting a Single IRB to facilitate regulatory
compliance. Aim 2 develops improved guidance for registry utilization, provides statistical support for end
users, and spearheads studies of high impact, defined by the Steering Committee. Aim 3 proposes an
innovative use of data to connect investigators who have similar patients through a specific matchmaking
approach. In Aim 4, we will utilize USIDNET data to augment efforts to enrich immunology HPO terms and
ClinGen entries. In Aim 5, we will galvanize successful dissemination efforts, develop a newsletter with
structured features to improve clarity, and enhance material on our website. In Aim 6, we will formalize
mentoring efforts to strengthen the research skills of the next generation and provide career mentoring. These
resources will provide pivotal information for the Immunology community at a time when the wealth of new
monogenic Inborn Errors of Immunity have made clinical decision making far more complex and uncertain.
This new R24 builds on previous successes defining phenotypes in Inborn Errors of Immunity, improves data
collection, and utilizes the data in new ways to support the community."

neurobiological consequences that can result from adolescent binge drinking. However, the molecular
mechanism of how EtOH exerts immediate effects on the cellular microenvironment to perpetuate these long-
term effects have not been fully ascertained. EtOH can readily enter cells and immediately activate the cellular
stress response, which can then impact transcriptional and translational processes as well as post-translational
modifications of existing proteins. We predict these immediate EtOH-induced effects on the cellular
environment prime the cell to drive the long-term changes we and others have observed. This proposal is a
competitive renewal and this next phase of the project will mechanistically define how EtOH induced
modifications to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which then impacts long-term GR function. GRs sit at a
pivotal interface to direct long-lasting changes in the cellular transcriptome and proteome, as they are the core
molecular mediators of the systemic and cellular stress response. Our published and preliminary data suggest
that these key mediators of cellular homeostasis are vulnerable to perturbations by EtOH, especially during
adolescence. Aim 1 will determine by absolute quantification the amount of phosphorylated GR (pGR) in the
brain using our in vivo model of adolescent repeated binge EtOH exposure and mechanistically link GR
phosphorylation with long-term HPA axis dysfunction. In addition, we will investigate novel post-translational
modifications to GR that are induced by adolescent binge EtOH exposure. Aim 2 will determine the suite of
proteins interacting with pGR at specific target genes and identify how EtOH disrupts these GR-protein
association. Aim 3 will investigate how EtOH induces alternative GR mRNA splicing and the mechanisms
regulating splicing. Understanding these fundamental molecular changes could uncover novel therapeutic
targets that may prevent dysregulated cellular signaling leading to behavioral abnormalities later in life."

 Sepsis is the leading cause of admission to intensive care units (ICUs) in the U.S., and the leading cause of
respiratory failure and death in ICUs. The majority of ICU patients with sepsis or septic shock have either respiratory
infection as the source of sepsis, or have respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. In recognition of the burden
of sepsis in the U.S., sepsis “bundles” were introduced to facilitate guideline implementation in clinical practice (known
as the 3-Hour bundle). Since the introduction of sepsis bundles, multiple observational studies have demonstrated a
consistent, strong association between implementation of sepsis bundles and improved survival. These data led to the
New York State (NYS) Sepsis initiative, which demonstrated a significant association between adherence with sepsis
bundles and improved survival, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) mandated public reporting
of sepsis measures (SEP-1). Analysis of the NYS database has revealed that completion of the 3-Hour bundle in
patients with respiratory failure was associated with an 8.6% absolute reduction in mortality (18.5 RRR). For those
patients who completed the 3-Hour bundle within 1 hour, the mortality reduction was even higher, 9.8% (RRR 21.7%).
In 2018, the Hour-1 bundle was published to underscore the need for urgency in the treatment of septic patients. We
believe that the primary beneficial effect of both the Hour-1 and 3-Hour bundle is in patients with respiratory failure. It is
not known if implementation of the Hour-1 bundle reduces mortality more than the 3 Hour bundle. Although adherence
with the 3-Hour bundle (SEP-1) is mandated by CMS, compliance is moderate (60%), suggesting an active
implementation process for the 3-hour bundle is necessary to compare the Hour-1 bundle to the 3-Hour bundle. The
current proposal is a pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial using a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation
approach to evaluate mortality and respiratory failure-based outcomes and bundle adherence, in emergency room
patients with sepsis. We will compare the hour-1 bundle to the 3-hour bundle. The outcome measures include hospital
mortality, hospital length of stay, ventilator-free days, and incidence of respiratory failure. The effectiveness of a clinical
intervention (Hour-1 bundle) is implemented using a rigorous implementation strategy (the Exploration,
adoption/Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment – EPIS – multi-level conceptual model) for both the 1- and 3-Hour
bundles. We will also evaluate a possible precision-based approach in this study. Routine clinical information available at
hospital presentation will identify 4 discrete, sepsis phenotypes and we hypothesize that 2 of these identify patients who
are significantly more likely to benefit from the 1-Hour bundle in future studies. Our team has extensive experience
conducting multi-center trials in sepsis guided by effective models of implementation science. We have developed
automated screening tools to identify patients with sepsis and have guided state-wide implementation of sepsis
performance measures. We have also used automated EHR methods to screen for and enroll septic patients into these
studies. This novel, hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation approach addresses key gaps to facilitate the
implementation of evidence-based strategies to improve patient outcomes from sepsis and acute respiratory failure."

Heart failure (HF) is a chronic, progressive and irreversible disorder that is associated with significant morbidity,
mortality and expense. However, recovery of cardiac function has been reported in ~15% of HF patients on left
ventricular assist devices (LVADs), which can be significant enough to allow for device explantation. Thus, the
ability to potentiate cardiac recovery would be paradigm-shifting. Identification of factors associated with cardiac
recovery will provide an opportunity to a) focus our efforts aimed at promoting recovery, b) gain insight into the
mechanisms leading to disease progression and reversal, and c) discover new therapeutic targets. My goal in
seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training and experience
to pioneer the novel field of epigenomics and genomics of HF by positioning myself as a pivotal translational
integrator in the virtuous cycle of “bedside to bench research and back”. My clinical background along with the
translational research training gained through this proposal, will allow me to orchestrate successful translational
studies by prioritizing gene pathways of high clinical relevance for functional studies and by better standardizing
and integrating clinical and genomic data. This proposal includes a discovery approach to understand the
molecular bases for HF and cardiac recovery (Aim 1) and a predictive approach to design a multivariate model
predictive of cardiac recovery (Aim 2). In Aim 1, we will focus on answering the questions “what gene pathways
are dysregulated in HF” and “does LVAD therapy uniquely alter these gene pathways in responders vs non-
responders” (Aim 1A), for which we will compare DNA methylation and gene expression from myocardium of
HF and non-failing controls, followed by comparisons between pre- and post-LVAD within responders as
compared to non-responders. Next, we will investigate the molecular mechanisms by which DNA methylation
reprograms cardiac metabolism in cardiac recovery. We hypothesize that DNMT3a binds to, and methylates,
specific genetic loci to alter gene expression involved in regulation of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation
(Aim 1B). We will perform ChIP-qPCR of DNMT3a in a targeted manner of our already identified gene candidates
(e.g. HADHA, etc.). In Aim 2, we will define the epigenetic predictors of cardiac recovery, by comparing DNA
methylation and gene expression in responders and non-responders at the pre-LVAD timepoint, and will build a
multivariable predictive model including clinical variables. The expertise of our multidisciplinary team, combined
with formal didactics will provide the support needed to achieve my training aims, developing skills in: (1) design
of genetic/epigenetic studies; (2) bioinformatics; and (3) professional development as a PI. In summary, our
research will further our understanding of the mechanisms involved in HF and recovery and lay the foundation
for the discovery of novel and personalized approaches to treat HF and improve patients’ outcomes. With
completion of the training aims, I will be uniquely-positioned to pursue a career as an independent investigator
with expertise in conducting sound genomic/epigenomic research in cardiac failure and recovery."

 It is now well understood that familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an under diagnosed and under treated
cause of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Recent advances in genetics and results
from population-based studies of FH suggest that the broad phenotypic definition of FH, severely elevated low
density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and positive family history of premature ASCVD or high cholesterol,
encompasses four distinct clinical subtypes: 1) monogenic FH caused by a pathogenic variant in an FH gene, 2)
polygenic hypercholesterolemia caused by the cumulative inheritance of many common alleles associated with
incremental increases in LDL-C, 3) elevated lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) and severe hypercholesteremia, and 4) severe
hypercholesteremia in the absence of a genetic cause. We hypothesize that differences in risk of incident ASCVD
exist among the four FH subtypes. Risk assessment in FH has become increasingly complex with multiple factors
influencing outcomes: LDL-C level, presence of a genetic variant, presence of additional ASCVD risk factors,
Lp(a) level, pre-existing ASCVD, age, and gender. Further complicating risk assessment are health disparities
related to age, sex, rurality, and race/ethnicity. Current shortcomings in FH care suggest two immediate needs:
more accurate risk assessment and strategies to communicate this risk information to the diverse population
impacted. The goals of this proposal are to 1) demonstrate the impact of FH subtype on ASCVD prognosis, and
2) study the best ways to communicate this complex FH risk information to clinicians and patients, with
consideration of health disparities as barriers to care for both clinicians and patients.
 In Aim 1, this proposal will develop a foundation for accomplishing these goals by creating a cohort of
over 800K people using individual-level data from Geisinger, Mt. Sinai, and the UK Biobank integrated with
variant-level data from the ClinVar genetic database, allowing molecular assignment of FH subtypes, ASCVD
phenotyping, and characterization of risk. Our anticipated study sample will include approximately 2,500
individuals with a pathogenic FH variant and 50,000 individuals with a variant-negative FH subtype. In Aim 2, we
will use this cohort to determine ASCVD outcomes in the four subtypes, including assessment of the impact of
conventional risk factors and polygenic risk for ASCVD independent of blood lipids. We will also assess the
impact of health disparities on outcomes. At the same time, in Aim 3 we will use implementation science to
investigate barriers and facilitators to the communication of preventative health information at Geisinger and Mt.
Sinai. We will focus on attitudes and perceptions of patients and providers with an emphasis on known care
disparities and their impact on care. This proposal will show the benefit of a precise genomic characterization of
FH risk, and the value of additional ASCVD risk assessment. By understanding the barriers to care at the
clinician and patient level and the value of accounting for known disparities, we will demonstrate best practices
for communicating this information in a way that improves clinical practice and patient understanding."

This competitive renewal seeks funding for years 16-20 of a successful institutional training grant focusing on
the science of organ and tissue transplantation. The Advanced Research Training in Transplantation Sciences
(ARTTS) program at Emory University serves an area of medical science-- transplantation biology-- that is
exceptionally rigorous, uniquely multidisciplinary, and in dire need of new students to take up the substantial
momentum established in the past 30 years. The application seeks to fund 1 pre-doctoral and 2 post-doctoral
trainees each year, and individual appointments will last for 2 years. It seeks to produce trainees that go on to
establish independent research programs in the area of transplantation biology. Since its inception in 2006, the
program has successfully recruited and trained 9 pre-doctoral trainees and 14 post-doctoral trainees. Of the 6
pre-doctoral ARTTS trainees who have completed training, 100% had a first author publication as a result of
their graduate research, and on average they published an impressive 4.4 first author and 6.0 total peer-
reviewed manuscripts. Of the 12 past post-doctoral ARTTS trainees who have completed training, 100% had a
first author publication as a result of their post-doctoral research, and on average they published 2.2 first
author and 2.6 total peer-reviewed manuscripts. Furthermore, 86% of past pre-doctoral and 84% of past post-
doctoral ARTTS Program trainees remain in research-intensive careers or are still in training (an additional
14% and 8% respectively are in research-related careers). Thus, the program has been highly successful in
recruiting and training the next generation of transplantation scientists. The current proposal represents the
continued commitment of a team of highly productive, diverse, and actively collaborating junior and senior
investigator/mentors, with an associated group of dedicated instructors, on a strong institutional foundation of
fundamental academic excellence, to execute a unique and carefully designed training program that will
continue to attract and retain highly motivated trainees to the transplantation field, and give them the unique
tool set needed to influence the prevailing problems in the field. The ARTTS Program thus now offers an
incredibly rich environment spanning powerful murine models in transplantation and viral immunology, an
intensive translational program at the Yerkes National Primate Center, and markedly augmented opportunities
in clinical trials and human immunology. The program continues to evolve to better attract highly qualified
candidates from across the country representing a diversity of races and ethnicities, and importantly now offers
a research focus on health disparities among minority groups in transplantation, and a particular focus to
enhancing career development in women trainees. Thus, the current offering is on the cutting edge of training
in transplantation sciences, and undoubtedly will contribute to improving the future of transplantation research
and practice for diverse individuals, and optimizing both length and quality of life for transplant recipients."

Management of pain is a significant problem in the elderly, with the burden of chronic pain
heavily tilted toward older adults. The high incidence of pain in the elderly has been suggested to
be related to an increase in stress and underlying painful conditions throughout the life span (e.g.,
inflammation, surgery, disease, chemotherapy, and other stressful life events), which led the PI
to her central hypothesis that nociceptor neuroplasticity in the elderly contributes to this increase
in chronic pain. Hyperalgesic priming (priming) is a form of nociceptor neuroplasticity, a long-
lasting change in nociceptor function, induced by trauma, inflammation, and stress. Therefore, it
is of great interest to determine if the high incidence of pain in the elderly is related to priming,
and whether it is caused by systemic inflammation, and if the treatments that reverse priming
could provide a basis for the treatment of chronic pain in the elderly. In Aim (1) we propose to
establish that aged rats express nociceptor plasticity (priming), the age at which priming develops,
and if priming is associated with systemic inflammation (measuring the levels of circulating
inflammatory cytokines) in F344xBN elderly rats. In Aim (2) we propose to identify mechanisms
underlying priming in the elderly, determining the role of Type I and Type II priming in age-
associated priming, and in which nociceptor population priming occurs. It is also known that age-
related changes in mitochondria are associated with decline in mitochondrial function and,
recently, mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in priming. Therefore, in Aim (2) we will
also test the hypothesis that systemic inflammation and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production by mitochondrial dysfunction, result in priming. We will evaluate, by
immunofluorescence, if ROS activity is greater in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from aged rats, if
modulating mitochondrial electron chain transport complex and scavenging a mitochondria-
specific superoxide, in vivo, alleviates age-associated priming, and evaluate the oxygen
consumption rate, ex vivo by the seahorse analyzer, to better understand how the main
mitochondrial energy producing pathways are altered in association with age-associated priming,
in DRG neurons. Since there are sex differences in pain syndromes in the elderly, and in priming,
all the proposed experiments will be performed in both sexes, paving the way to more
personalized management of pain in the elderly. The results of the proposed studies may be useful
as a guide for the development of novel therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of chronic
pain in the elderly."
10870976,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Misuse of antibiotics leads to the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens and can perturb the endogenous
microbiome, providing opportunities for secondary infection by pathobionts, including Staphylococcus aureus.
The long-term goal of this work is to understand the chemical mechanisms used by Dolosigranulum pigrum, a
beneficial bacterial species found in the human nose, to compete against co-occurring S. aureus, and to
develop therapeutics against this pathobiont. The overall objectives in this application are to (i) isolate and
identify ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) that are produced by D.
pigrum to inhibit S. aureus and (ii) establish a genetic system for D. pigrum that will enable future research into
this organism. The central hypothesis is that D. pigrum is a mutualist that defends its host in the nose against
pathobionts, including S. aureus. The rationale for this project is that its successful completion will lead to the
identification of candidate anti-S. aureus RiPPs from D. pigrum that could be developed into new therapeutics
and open new avenues for research into the beneficial roles of D. pigrum in the nose. The central hypothesis
will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Identify anti-S. aureus RiPPs produced by D. pigrum; and 2)
Develop a genetic system in D. pigrum for deletion of BGCs and other genes of interest. Under Specific Aim 1,
D. pigrum isolates will be cultured from nasal swab specimens. The D. pigrum isolates will be assessed for
their ability to inhibit multiple S. aureus strains using co-culture plate inhibition assays under conditions
mimicking the human nasal cavity. Metabolites will be extracted from D. pigrum cultures, purified, and
characterized using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine the
structure of bioactive anti-S. aureus RiPPs. For Specific Aim 2, a system to delete BGCs and other genes of
interest will be established in D. pigrum. Electroporation, polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation, and
intergeneric conjugation will be tested to identify an approach that can be used to introduce exogenous DNA
into D. pigrum. Subsequently, targeted deletions of RiPP-encoding BGCs in D. pigrum will be performed
through allelic exchange, and the resulting mutants will be tested in co-culture with S. aureus to verify the
impact of specific BGCs on interspecies interactions. The research proposed in this application is innovative
because it aims to identify anti-S. aureus RiPPs by uncovering the molecular mechanisms behind an
ecologically relevant competitive interaction between D. pigrum and S. aureus. The proposed research is
significant because it will address the critical need to identify novel therapeutics for S. aureus infections and
aims to minimize disruption to the nasal microbiome, which is essential for preventing other opportunistic
infections and maintaining overall health."
10872223,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neurons, the basic processing and communicating units of the brain, typically use action potentials to transmit
messages from a site near the cell body to neurotransmitter releasing terminals via axons. Action potentials
can, in some cases, also travel backwards along the axon towards the cell body and dendrites; I refer to these
here as ‘ectopics.’ Ectopics have been recorded in models of epilepsy, as well as in a small group of inhibitory
interneurons under normal conditions. Recently, I discovered that nearly all parvalbumin positive (PV+) cells
of the brain, which account for about half of neocortical inhibitory cells, can fire ectopics. We do not yet know
exactly where in the axon ectopics are generated. In addition to not knowing where in the axon they come from,
we also do not know what mechanism generates them. Finally, we do not know what conditions lead to ectopics
in vivo. Here, I propose a series of experiments designed to answer these questions. In Aim 1, I will test
whether receptors, ion channels, and cotransporters capable of depolarizing the presynaptic terminal are
involved in ectopic generation. I will also use an ultra-rapid imaging technique to track action potentials as
they travel through the axons of PV+ cells to directly confirm both where ectopics are generated and the
number of synapses they trigger. In Aim 2 I will determine whether astrocytes, which envelop and modulate
PV+ cell terminals, help elicit ectopics by blocking astrocyte-specific transporters and receptors, as well as by
modulating intracellular astrocytic calcium stores and optogenetically depolarizing astrocytes. Finally, in Aim
3, I will undertake a series of experiments to detect ectopics in PV+ cells while mice are under anesthesia, and
in various awake, behaving conditions. These experiments will discern both how, and in what contexts, ectopics
are generated. Understanding the mechanisms of ectopic action potential initiation will yield new insights into
the function of an important population of inhibitory interneurons. It may also reveal mechanisms that relate
to brain disorders involving cortical hyperexcitability, providing novel targets for future investigations of
circuit-level changes related to these brain disorders and, potentially, new approaches to treatment.
This mentored award will support the training I need to establish an independent career as an academic
physician-scientist. I will develop technical expertise in voltage-sensitive dye imaging and in vivo recording
techniques under the direction of my mentor, Dr. Barry Connors, Ph.D., with input from advisory committee
members Drs. Judy Liu, M.D., Ph.D. and Christopher Moore, Ph.D., who are leading experts in their fields. I
will supplement this training with courses in the responsible conduct of research, molecular neuroscience
techniques, and grant writing, along with attendance at local seminars and national meetings to disseminate
my findings and foster collaborations. This training will help me achieve my goal of becoming an independent
investigator exploring the neurocircuitry underlying neuropsychiatric disorders using cutting edge techniques."
10872226,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In our daily lives, we choose between different courses of action with the hope of achieving desired positive
outcomes and avoiding feared negative outcomes; this is complicated by various forms of uncertainty that impact
the probability that any given action will result in a particular outcome. Within NIMH’s RDoC framework, studies
of the mechanisms involved in reward-based action valuation and choice have informed constructs listed under
the Positive Valence Systems (PVS) domain. Associated paradigms examine how differences in outcome
probability (first order uncertainty) and action-outcome contingency uncertainty (second order uncertainty)
impact choice between alternate options. Within the Negative Valence Systems (NVS) domain, the construct of
potential threat (anxiety) does not include consideration of the impact of potential threat, its probability and action-
outcome contingency uncertainty, upon action valuation or choice; in addition paradigms listed under the NVS
domain have no choice (instrumental) element and use physiological indices as dependent measures. These
differences between constructs and tasks across the PVS and NVS domains hinder attempts to elucidate
whether psychopathology-related deficits in probabilistic decision-making and the factors influencing action
valuation and choice are common across both domains or unique to one or the other. Here, we will address this
by creating equivalent PVs (reward) and NVS (shock) versions of two probabilistic decision-making tasks. We
will use a hierarchical Bayesian computational framework to model behavioral and brain (functional magnetic
resonance imaging) data from PVS and NVS versions of each task. This data will be acquired from healthy adult
humans with a range of anxiety and depressive symptomatology. In addition to group-level analyses, we will use
bifactor analysis to examine the latent factors underlying variance in anxiety and depressive symptomatology
across participants and will relate scores on these factors to parameter estimates obtained by modeling of
behavioral and brain data. Using this approach, we will examine commonalities and differences in the
mechanisms supporting probabilistic decision-making when potential outcomes are aversive versus rewarding
and alterations to these mechanisms as a function of anxiety and depressive related symptomatology. We hope
that this will advance our understanding of the aspects of decision-making disrupted in anxiety and depression
and the potential consequences for daily life. An additional goal of this research is to provide tasks and models
that can be used in future clinical studies of probabilistic decision-making across both PVS and NVS domains."
10872228,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by dying-back
degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. The most common known cause of familial and sporadic
forms of ALS as well as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion
(HRE) in C9ORF72 (C9). Our laboratory and others recently discovered that impaired nucleocytoplasmic
transport (NCT) is a fundamental and early pathogenic event in C9-ALS that requires stress granule formation.
However, downstream effects of impaired NCT are unclear. Recent studies have shown that autophagosome
biosynthesis occurs in the distal axon followed by retrograde transport of autophagic vesicles (AVs) to the
soma as they mature, providing a potential link between axon transport (AT) and autophagy, two mechanisms
well known to be involved early in ALS pathophysiology. In Drosophila expressing 30 GGGGCC repeats
(30R), we have found an accumulation of p62 and lysosomes, suggesting that impaired regulation of
autophagy and lysosomes may be a pathogenic mechanism for C9-ALS. Further, we have found preliminary
evidence of a reduction in retrograde autophagosome transport in 30R Drosophila. Consistent with this,
preliminary experiments in iPS motor neurons (iPSNs) derived from patients with C9-ALS showed an
accumulation of lysosomes in axons. Specific Aim 1 will further characterize axon transport of multiple cargo in
30R Drosophila and C9 iPSNs using live cell imaging methods. Specific Aim 2 will examine the interrelation
between axon transport, autophagy and lysosomal function and determine if rescuing autophagy can rescue
axon transport deficits of AVs. Finally, preliminary fly data shows that Mitf/TFEB, a transcription factor
regulating autophagy and lysosomes, is mislocalized to the cytoplasm in 30R Drosophila, indicating that
impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport may lead to impaired autophagy and lysosome regulation. Specific Aim
3 will address the hypothesis that impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport is upstream of impaired axon transport
defects and disruptions in autophagy. By using powerful parallel approaches in Drosophila, allowing precise
genetic manipulation of AT and autophagy, and iPSNs derived from patients with C9-ALS, allowing
experimental manipulation of human cells with the disease, this proposal will investigate detailed mechanistic
pathways of axon transport and regulation of autophagy and lysosomes in C9-ALS. Results from these studies
will not only aid our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment strategies of ALS, but they will also
further our understanding of the axonal biology of autophagy, important in all neurodegenerative diseases."

Locomotor recovery is one of the most important goals of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Ambulatory
deficits severely impact daily functions resulting in lower quality of life for people living with paralysis due to SCI.
Although studies have shown that locomotor training improves locomotor function in people with chronic SCI,
the benefits remain limited. Our overall hypothesis is that we can engage additional descending motor pathways,
such as the reticulospinal tract (RST), to improve locomotor function in humans with chronic incomplete SCI.
The goals of this proposal are: (1) Examine the contribution of the RST to lower limb muscles during locomotion,
and (2) to combine non-invasive paired RST activation and electrical muscle stimulation with treadmill training
to improve motor output in individuals with chronic incomplete SCI.
In Aim 1, we propose to measure the effects of a loud auditory stimulus to engage the RST on the amplitude and
latency of electromyographic responses in multiple lower limb muscles such as the quadriceps femoris,
hamstrings, soleus, and tibialis anterior bilaterally during locomotion in individuals with and without SCI. In Aim
2, we propose to test the effects of a novel intervention that uses repeated paired loud auditory and electrical
stimulation of muscle afferents combined with locomotor training on walking speed and voluntary muscle
strength. Here, individuals with chronic incomplete SCI will be randomly assigned to a group that will receive 10
sessions of a startle stimulus and electrical stimulation combined with locomotor training or 10 sessions of a non-
startle stimulus combined with locomotor training.
Taken together, the results of these studies will provide fundamental information about the contributions of the
RST to locomotion in humans with and without SCI and will furthermore open novel avenues for improving
locomotor function in individuals living with paralysis due to SCI."

Breastfeeding confers numerous health benefits for both mother and child; however, despite improvements on
a national level of breastfeeding rates (initiation, exclusivity, and duration), disparities have widened for certain
racial and ethnic groups. The gap between white and non-Hispanic black (NHB) women has worsened, with
only 73.6% of NHB women-initiated breastfeeding compared to 85.5% of white women in 2019. The
breastfeeding peer counselor (PC) model is breastfeeding promotion and social support program that has
demonstrated positive effects on breastfeeding outcomes and is perceived favorably, mainly among lower-
income NHB women. However, there is a need for breastfeeding PC programs that are specifically tailored to
the needs of NHB women, intended for NHB women of all socioeconomic backgrounds, and can be feasibly
implemented in the community. In addition, the vast majority of breastfeeding research focuses on assessing
exclusivity of breastfeeding and far less attention is paid to partial breastfeeding; this measurement approach
may underestimate breastfeeding and obscure positive findings. During the K99 phase, Aim 1 will entail a
qualitative examination into the factors that influence the decision-making process of whether to breastfeed
among NHB women. During the R00 phase, Aim 2 will utilize the findings of Aim 1 to design a breastfeeding
PC intervention, using an intervention mapping process, tailoring to the needs and preferences of NHB women
and the capacity of potential program implementers. Also during the R00 phase, Aim 3 will consist of the
design and validation of a breastfeeding intensity instrument to better capture partial breastfeeding; Aim 4 will
involve piloting the tailored BPC program using a randomized controlled design to evaluate the impact on
breastfeeding outcomes. Collectively, this research will further our understanding of factors that impact
breastfeeding decisions among NHB women and potentially improve breastfeeding outcomes through the
design of a breastfeeding PC program tailored specifically for NHB women. These research efforts would
support the emergence of a dedicated early career researcher (PI Kasprzak) with expertise in qualitative
methods, community-based interventions, lactation education and support, and implementation research.
The mentorship team offers expertise in behavioral interventions (Dr. Leone) and breastfeeding research (Dr.
Cadwell, Dr. Racine), with collaboration support on community-engaged research, intervention design and
tailoring for vulnerable populations (Dr. Cadzow, Dr. Singleton, Dr. Racine), and quantitative methods and
study design (Dr. Singleton, Dr. Racine, Dr. Simms, Mr. Paluch). Dr. Kasprzak’s career development will occur
within the Department of Community Health and Health Behavior at the University at Buffalo, which is
comprised of a network of productive and interdisciplinary researchers. If awarded, this K99/R00 will facilitate
Dr. Kasprzak’s advancement to independent community-based interventionist with the skills necessary to
maintain an impactful research program aimed at narrowing health disparities among vulnerable populations."
10868597,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) arises from a complex interaction between genetics and environmental
influences such as stress, which leads to persistent changes in frontolimbic gene expression and cellular
function. Although MDD has been predominantly studied in the context of neuronal function, emerging evidence
indicates that dysregulation of glia may be equally important. In particular, astrocytes are key determinants of
the neuronal microenvironment and can modulate synaptic efficacy through a wide range of secreted and
contact-mediated signaling. Chronic stress can cause astrocytes to undergo broad transcriptomic changes,
which can lead to loss of normal supportive functions, and gain of potentially neurotoxic qualities, both of which
can be equally disruptive to the overall activity of surrounding circuitry[8]. Understanding this astrocyte
plasticity and how it contributes to the pathophysiology of inflammation-related psychiatric disease is a
central question in this proposal. Our laboratory has implemented FANS coupled ATAC-seq to profile the
cell type-specific regulatory landscape in human MDD orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), (Aim 1) a brain region that
processes reward-based decision-making and may mediate anhedonic symptoms in MDD. Using this approach,
I identified a key pioneer factor, ZBTB7A, which regulates chromatin structure specifically in astrocytes to
facilitate feed-forward pro-inflammatory transcriptional cycles driven by NF-kB (with which ZBTB7A also directly
interacts). In a series of studies utilizing astrocyte-specific viral manipulations, I found that overexpressing (OE)
this chromatin remodeler in rodent OFC astrocytes was sufficient to induce aberrant expression of inflammatory
genes, behavioral deficits, and neuronal hyperactivity in response to a mild stressor, compared to GFP-
expressing mice. My findings indicate that OE of Zbtb7a in OFC astrocytes initiates a change in astrocyte
phenotype that has selective, direct effects on neuronal transmission. However, understanding the specific
impact of Zbtb7a OE on astrocyte plasticity, as well as the non-cell autonomous effects of astrocytic Zbtb7a OE
requires expression profiling with single-cell resolution. Therefore, in Aim 2 I propose to perform single-nuclei
RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on virally-infected OFC tissues from this same cohort of Zbtb7a OE animals vs.
GFP in order to create a comprehensive cellular map and transcriptomic profile of cell-type specific changes
across neural and glial populations in the OFC. I hypothesize that Zbtb7a OE induces key gene expression
changes to elicit cell-autonomous maladaptive astrocyte phenotypes that reverse the normal adaptive role of
astrocytes in responding to mild stress. In Aim 3, I will focus on identifying laboratories for my postdoctoral work,
prioritizing expertise in multiplexed “omics” profiling, circuit-specific approaches (including spatial
transcriptomics), and electrophysiology, which will build on my current training to allow me to further investigate
the role of astrocyte plasticity in psychiatric disease. Aim 3 will also emphasize strengthening essential
professional development skills in order to facilitate my progress towards independent research."

presents students with a unique opportunity to obtain individualized training in all aspects of biomedical sciences,
including basic cell and molecular biology, microbiology, structural biology, biophysics, genetics, immunology,
neurobiology, systems and computational biology, as well as translational biomedical disease-related research.
The underlying rationale for this program was to provide graduate students with a thorough grounding in the
basics of biochemistry, genetics, cell and molecular biology through a series of ‘core courses.’ With the aim of
expanding and unifying the graduate programs, the CMBS program has been expanded to include not only an
umbrella track, but also tracks in Structural Biology/Molecular Biophysics, Cell Biology/Stem Cell Biology,
Microbiology and Immunology, Pathobiology and Mechanisms of Disease, Cancer Biology and Systems Biology.
All the students in these tracks take the same ‘core courses’ and then choose elective courses specific to the
tracks. One of the unique aspects of the CMBS program is that students can elect to stay in the “umbrella” track,
thereby allowing them to choose their own program of courses that fit their interests. For the core courses,
trainees will take courses in biochemistry, cell and molecular biology, molecular genetics and statistics. They
will take courses in responsible conduct of research, and training in rigor and reproducibility. They will have
many opportunities to present their research and will submit a first author paper before they graduate. Students
in this training program will learn to evaluate and analyze biomedical literature critically and identify important
biomedical research questions. They will also assess the significant questions and to determine if the research
questions were approached rigorously, develop an independent research plan with rigorous and reproducible
experimental design, quantitative approaches and data interpretation and identify rules of responsible conduct
of research. As part of their training they will learn to perform research independently, responsibly and rigorously
and conduct work both individually and as part of a research team. Upon completion of the training program,
they will be able to present research to a wider audience, both in oral and written presentations and evaluate the
possible careers in biomedical research that are available upon graduation. The CMBS Program hosts a student
research seminar series and a biennial student faculty retreat. Most students graduated in 5-6 years. We plan
to support eight students for two years during their first two years of graduate study. The CMBS Program remains
the premier cellular and molecular biology graduate program at Columbia University Medical Center and support
from this Training Grant is crucial for the continued success of this program."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is significant health threat that is the fastest growing top 10 cause of death in the
United States. AD currently costs Americans $280 billion dollars in direct health care costs annually. AD is
characterized by, among other things, fibrils of aggregated microtubule associated protein tau. Tau in these fibrils
is unique in several ways including truncation by caspases. The role of caspases and cleaved tau in AD has not
been clearly defined, and two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses have been proposed. The first hypothesis is
that caspases are being upregulated early in AD and cleave tau to a toxic species. A second possible explanation
is that caspases are overexpressed in response to tau upregulation and cleavage of tau occurs after AD
progression has been initiated.
 The overall goal of this proposal is understanding the role caspase cleaved tau plays in tau pathology. To
date, several truncated tau products have been observed in vivo, but most efforts to understand the role of these
products has revolved around genetic or chemical inhibition of caspases. Among all caspases, inhibition of
caspase-3 and capase-6 have shown to alleviate tau pathology and cell death in cell and animal models.
Knockout of caspase-3 is lethal in mice, but caspase-6 can be knocked out of mice without any adverse effects.
This begs the question, is caspases-6 a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD? For the answer to
this question to be yes, it must be shown why blocking caspase-6 alleviates tau pathology.
 Our central hypothesis is that caspase cleavage of tau results in a proteotoxic species that promotes
tauopathy and cell death in AD. To demonstrate this, we will first characterize where caspases can cleave tau in
a recombinant system. Next, we will characterize the stability, seeding propensity, cellular half-life, and toxicity
of these cleaved tau proteins. Finally, we will show that cells expressing uncleavable tau are resistant to toxicity
associated with caspase induction. These experiments will demonstrate that tau cleavage is necessary for
neuronal cell death induced by caspase induction. When combined with previous the observations that 1)
cleaved tau correlates with AD progression and 2) blockage of caspase activity alleviates tau pathology and cell
death, the proposed research will provide a strong case for caspases as therapeutic targets in AD."
10868503,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The regulation of transient cell behaviors and regulatory “states” is indispensable for the development
of multicellular organisms. Knowledge of the genetic architecture and emergent properties of these
processes is also key to developing therapies for congenital diseases and neurodevelopmental
syndromes based on cellular reprogramming or genome editing. The objective of this proposal is to
characterize the regulation and functions of potentially important genes that control polarized neuronal
migration and axon outgrowth in the Ciona larval nervous system, which shares many anatomical and
molecular features with the larger systems of their close relatives the vertebrates. The central
hypothesis is that these processes are controlled by precise developmental regulation of genes
encoding rate-limiting components of diverse biochemical pathways, which may vary according to
developmental stage and neuronal subtype. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that, by
exploiting the genomic and cellular simplicity afforded by invariantly developing Ciona embryos, one
can study these processes in vivo, with greater spatial and temporal resolution. With only 231 neurons
and a fully mapped “connectome”, the Ciona nervous system offers a singular opportunity to
understand cell behaviors and developmental trajectories in a chordate nervous system at single-cell
resolution. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Testing the role of
instrinsic and extrinsic TGFβ pathway components in dynamically but invariantly polarizing neuronal
progenitors; 2) Investigating the causal links between regulation of effectors of receptor trafficking and
precisely timed inversion of intracellular polarity and axon outgrowth orientation. 3) Investigating the
role of collective epithelial sheet-like migration in precise positioning and morphogenesis of
differentiated neurons, and testing the involvement of tight junction proteins in regulating this unusual
mode of collective migration. These aims will be pursued using an innovative approach that combines
cell lineage-specific, CRISPR/Cas9-based somatic gene knockouts and live fluorescence microscopy.
The expected outcomes of the proposed work include identifying previously unrecognized functions for
conserved but poorly studied genes in neurodevelopment, and understanding how precise control
over neuronal subtype-specific polarized cell behaviors can be achieved through transcriptional
regulation of both intrinsic and extrinsic effector genes."

10866721,"Project Summary/Abstract
Information on drug safety is critical to health care and policy decisions, as treatment recommendations hinge on
accurate knowledge of both efficacy and harms. However, assessments of drug safety from individual clinical trials are
often underpowered due to insufficient sample sizes and have limited generalizability due to restrictive inclusion/exclusion
criteria. Meta-analysis of clinical trials offers a unique opportunity to assess adverse event risks in a large sample size
for a broad population, but requires careful consideration of how to handle safety outcomes. Critically, methods that
are appropriate for assessing treatment benefits are inappropriate for assessing harms. A key distinction between safety
and efficacy data stems from the multifaceted nature of adverse events. There are many types of adverse events, each
correlated with different potential risk factors. The severity of these adverse events can vary widely, spanning from mild
to fatal. Moreover, many adverse drug effects are infrequent and typically suffer from incomplete reporting. In particular,
incomplete reporting of adverse events impacts the ability of systematic reviews to synthesize toxicity data, which can
promote a false impression of safety or misinform clinical and regulatory decisions.
To address these challenges, we propose to develop novel meta-analytic methods for combining safety data. Specifically,
our objectives are to develop meta-analysis approaches that can handle multivariate outcome data, account for the
severity of adverse events, and identify potential interactions among risk factors through the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: To develop meta-analysis methods for multivariate outcomes.
Specific Aim 2: To develop methods for meta-analysis with ordinal event grading.
Specific Aim 3: To develop a method to identify high-risk subgroups.
All methods developed will allow for incomplete reporting and be implemented as easy-to-use software. We will apply
the proposed methods to understand the drug toxicity profiles and elucidate risk factors of adverse events resulting from
cancer immunotherapy and BTK inhibitors. These findings can be used for risk stratification of patients and to inform
potential risk-reduction or monitoring strategies. More broadly, the products of this proposal will promote scientific
rigor in summary data integration, allowing appropriate inference on the safety of medical interventions and ultimately
enhancing patient care.
Our proposed research will establish a new modeling framework that will overcome the limitations of current meta-
analysis approaches to synthesize data and information on drug safety. This work directly addresses priorities in
the strategic plan of the National Library of Medicine to accelerate discovery and advance health through
data-driven research. The new approaches, together with publicly available software, will provide a useful tool for the
wider scientific community to conduct more rigorous meta-analysis of safety data."
10869960,"Project Summary/ Abstract
We have developed a strategy for the analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) using a potential outcomes
causal framework. Likely responders (LRs) to a test treatment T are identified at the end of the trial and a
statistical test of the difference between T and placebo, P in this enriched sample is performed. LRs are identified
at the end of the trial by fitting a model, called a prognostic score function, that estimates the expected response
to T as a function of baseline features. The LR subset comprises individuals whose expected response exceeds a
pre-specified clinically defined minimum. Identifying LR achieves an important goal of precision medicine. The
causal effect of T compared to P among LRs is appraised based on the observed outcomes within strata of
samples matched on their prognostic score. It is well known that, especially for subsets of a random sample,
misspecification of the model can lead to spurious conclusions. To protect against this possibility in the
estimation of the prognostic score, we have adapted an approach, novel to RCTs, that we call the RCT dry run
(DRrct) diagnostic. It formally evaluates the potential for model misspecification. The value of the LR method
has been demonstrated in a reanalysis of a large multisite 26-week long double-blind RCT of extended release
gabapentin enacarbil (GE-XR) compared to placebo for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Substantial
benefits of treatment with GE-XR were found for the subset of patients predicted to be LRs based on their clinical
features. In this research project, we will explore new statistical and machine learning modeling strategies for
the prognostic score function and expand our knowledge of the statistical properties of the LR and DRrct
methods. The goal is to minimize bias and increase precision in estimation of the prognostic score model and
increasing power to test treatment effects in the LR subpopulation. To accomplish this we will use three
strategies: analytic/theoretical methods where possible, simulation of RCTs and the reanalysis of six NIAAA
RCTs comparing treatments for AUD. Although in most of the six trials, no treatment differences were found, it
may be that LR subgroups can be identified whose members obtain substantial clinical benefit. Each reanalysis
will utilize the DRrct method to appraise the possibility of model misspecification. The LR method has the
potential to change standard practice for the analysis of RCTs, reduce the rate of failure caused by analyses
limited to whole sample mean differences, and facilitate personalized medicine; the DRrct method has the
potential to reduce the rate of irreproducible RCTs; and the reanalysis of the six NIAAA studies has the
possibility of uncovering clinically meaningful relationships between patient characteristics and likely
responders to previously studied candidate AUD treatments."

Arginine methylation is one of the most common posttranslational modifications (PTMs), which is
comparable to phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) correspond to
“writers” that generate three types of methylated arginine residues: monomethylarginine (MMA), asymmetric
dimethylarginine (ADMA), and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA). PRMT1 is the main type I enzyme for
catalyzing ADMA, while PRMT5 is the predominant type II enzyme for generating SDMA. PRMT1/5
methylates many downstream substrates to regulate a variety of fundamental cellular processes, such as
transcription, DNA repair and cell signaling transduction. Deregulation of PRMT1/5 is frequently observed
in various cancers and is correlated with poor prognosis and survival of cancer patients. Like many other
PTMs, arginine methylation is a reversible process. Demethylases function as “erasers” to remove methyl
groups from targeted proteins. In addition, effector proteins called “reader” bind to methylarginine and mediate
signals transduction in cells. Although tremendous efforts have been made in the past three decades, there are
still many outstanding questions/gaps in the field of arginine methylation. How is PRMT activity regulated by
upstream signals/regulators? Are there specific arginine demethylases? What are the readers for numerous of
arginine methylated proteins? In this proposal, we will explore three projects to address these questions.
Project 1 will elucidate the molecular mechanism by which amino acids regulate PRMT1 subcellular
localization, activation, and function, revealing a novel upstream stimulus/regulator of PRMT1. Project 2 will
dissect roles of the ubiquitination pathway in regulation of PRMT5, defining a novel interplay between arginine
methylation and ubiquitination. Project 3 will identify novel demethylases and readers of arginine methylation,
filling the key gap in the field of arginine methylation. We will use a range of complementary methods including
biochemistry, mass spectrometric (MS) analysis, molecular and cellular biology, and mouse models in our
studies. Our short-term goal is to advance our understanding of arginine methylation biology by completing
proposed studies, and log-term goal is to identify novel targets/strategies/inhibitors to target arginine
methylation signaling pathway for cancer therapy. To achieve these goals, I will be committed to this program
at 51% “research effort”."

The University of Michigan’s Patient Safety Learning Laboratory (M-Well Lab) will design, implement, and
evaluate innovative, systems-based approaches that can improve patient safety by expanding the ways in
which we enhance the wellness of hospitalized patients and their healthcare providers. The wellness of
patients is inextricably linked to the emotional, mental, and physical health of their providers. Poor provider
wellness negatively impacts the entire healthcare organization, reducing both care quality and patient
satisfaction. Additionally, provider burnout is associated with increased risk of patient safety incidents and
poorer quality of care due to reduced professionalism. Identifying ways in which to improve wellness for
both patients and their providers thus presents a novel opportunity to improve patient safety. We propose 3
related specific aims. We will start by systematically analyzing the experience of both patients and
physicians through the healthcare system using a tool borrowed from engineering, mapping a “customer
journey” of patients and physicians in order to better understand time constraints and opportunities to
improve their wellness. Specific Aim 1, based on the Circle of Health model, will enhance patient wellness
by designing, implementing, and evaluating a Whole Health inpatient bundle of integrative medical
practices. Specific Aim 2 will address provider burnout and enhance wellness through two interlinking
projects. First, we will conduct a national survey of hospitalists to better understand elements that promote
physician wellness, focusing on possible protective factors such as religiosity and spirituality. Second, we
will design and implement educational interventions intended to teach hospitalists how best to foster “sacred
moments” in the hospital setting. Specific Aim 3 will build on Specific Aims 1 and 2 by developing programs
to promote interconnectedness between patients and physicians, using architectural design, human factors,
and the arts to design an optimal hospital room healing environment.
By connecting investigators from diverse disciplines – engineering, medicine, nursing, human factors,
architectural design, pastoral care, business, and others – all of whom share a common interest in using
healthcare engineering to enhance patient safety, we will cover the full spectrum of translational research:
problem analysis and design; solution development, evaluation, and implementation; and ultimately,
dissemination. We will develop and test novel approaches that have the potential to save lives, reduce
medical costs, and improve patient and family satisfaction with the healthcare they receive, while
simultaneously enhancing the emotional, mental, and physical health of their providers."
10869969,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The major cause of hearing loss is damage to the inner ear cochlear hair cells. One potential strategy to
regenerate hair cells and restore hearing is to induce the transdifferentiation of surrounding supporting cells into
new functional hair cells. This is based on the observation that non-mammalian vertebrates such as zebrafish
can replenish sensory hair cells throughout life from these neighboring supporting cells. However, the fact that
mature mammalian supporting cells lose the ability to transdifferentiate into hair cells poses a great challenge to
implement this strategy in the clinics to restore hearing in patients.
Our lab recently identified an epigenetic mechanism that restricts mouse supporting cell plasticity by permanent
closing of chromatin around enhancers driving expression of hair cell genes, including critical transcription factors
such as ATOH1 and POU4F3. ATOH1 is a master regulator that drives the differentiation of hair cells across
vertebrates, with the inability to upregulate Atoh1 expression in postnatal mouse supporting cells being a key
barrier to hair cell regeneration following injury.
In this proposal, I investigate how the highly regenerative zebrafish may escape such epigenetic repression by
examining chromatin accessibility near zebrafish hair cell genes. My preliminary single-nuclei ATAC sequencing
data reveal that several potential regulatory elements of zebrafish atoh1a remain accessible in supporting cells.
This is in contrast with what we observe at the mouse Atoh1 locus. Interestingly, this maintenance of chromatin
accessibility is specific to the atoh1a locus, as pou4f3 and other hair cell genes do not retain chromatin
accessibility in zebrafish supporting cells. This suggests that sequence-specific features of the atoh1a locus,
rather than general chromatin modifying enzymes, may account for this maintenance of accessibility in zebrafish
supporting cells. I hypothesize that intrinsic properties of the zebrafish atoh1a locus maintain accessibility of its
cis-regulatory elements, which facilitate its upregulation during hair cell regeneration.
In Aim 1, I test whether sequence differences between zebrafish and mouse atoh1a/Atoh1 loci account for the
fish-specific ability to maintain open chromatin. In Aim 2, I test a class of atoh1a enhancers that remain
accessible in supporting cells for their requirement for continued hair cell generation. I also test the role of a
second class of supporting cell-specific atoh1a elements in preventing ectopic hair cell formation from supporting
cells in the absence of injury. By learning how zebrafish maintain atoh1a locus in a poised state in adult
supporting cells, results from these aims will guide future endeavors to regenerate hair cells and restore hearing."

Upon encountering antigens, mature B cells express activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and undergo
immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM). CSR
proceeds through the obligate generation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), which constitute one of the
most toxic lesions that can occur in a cell. A single unrepaired DSB can cause cell death or potentiate
chromosomal translocations that are hallmarks of many types of cancer, including lymphomas. Thus,
mechanisms that promote generation of DSBs and facilitate DSB repair are intergral to both immunity and
preservation of genomic integrity. In this proposal we test the notion that non-canonical DNA structures such
as G-quadruplexes target the DNA deaminase AID to the chromatin during CSR (aim 1) and that AID can
regulate expression of non-Ig genes to influence B cell responses (aim 2). Successful completion of the
experiments will have far reaching implications in our understanding of both B cell immunity and B cell
lymphomas."

cardiac structure and impairment of cardiac function precede the development of HF and underlie HF subtypes.
Cardiac structure and function are heritable - genome-wide association studies have identified 57 common
variants associated with cardiac structure and function, however, genetic contribution to newer cardiac function
measures have not been explored. In addition, few data exist comprehensively characterizing genetic
associations (i.e., rare and structural variants) of cardiac structure and function, especially in minorities. Over
the past decade, we have investigated the genetic effect on HF and cross-sectional echo measures within the
setting of the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium. We now
propose to extend our effort to the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program by combing our rich
longitudinal phenotypic data with cutting-edge whole genome sequencing data in seven population-bases
cohorts. Our central hypothesis is that specific common, rare and structural genetic variants will be associated
with cardiac structure and function, as well as HF; and incorporating genetic predisposition to cardiac structure
and function alterations will improve HF risk prediction. In Aim 1, we will characterize genetic architecture of
cardiac structure and function and their longitudinal changes, and evaluate their effects on HF. To inform
understanding of HF physiology, we will assess the causal effects of proteins and metabolites on echo and HF
using Mendelian randomization approaches. In Aim 2, we will construct polygenic risk scores for cardiac structure
and function and assess their impact on HF risk prediction. We will apply a new approach for PRS construction,
and will use a machine learning algorithms to evaluate its prediction on the risk of HF. With the completion of
this project, we aim to generate insights into the biological pathways underlying progressive cardiac dysfunction
and HF, and to provide targets for drug development."

 Brucella spp. are bacteria that naturally infect a variety of domesticated and wild animals leading to
abortions and sterility, and these bacteria are also capable of causing debilitating human infections, which
often result from human exposure to infected animals and animal products. Brucella spp. are considered
threats as potential biological weapons. Importantly, antibiotic treatment against brucellosis is prone to disease
relapse, and there is currently no safe and effective vaccine to protect humans against infection with Brucella.
The brucellae are intracellular pathogens that reside within immune cells called macrophages where they
replicate in a specialized compartment, and the capacity of Brucella to survive and replicate within
macrophages is essential to their ability to cause disease. Over the last few years, our laboratory has
characterized genetic pathways that are critical for the intracellular survival and pathogenesis of Brucella
strains, and specifically, we have identified small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) that are essential for Brucella
virulence.
 Preliminary experiments have determined that one sRNA, called MavR, for MurF- and virulence-regulating
sRNA is required for full virulence of B. abortus in a mouse model of chronic Brucella infection. Preliminary
work has demonstrated that MavR is a negative regulator of MurF, which is an essential enzyme involved in
peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Taken together, these data led us to develop a model for the MavR-MurF genetic
pathway that is critical for Brucella virulence, and the work outlined in this application will test several
independent hypotheses associated with this important genetic circuit. In the end, the information gleaned from
these studies may be used to develop new therapeutic and vaccine strategies against human Brucella infection."

The physical inactivity (PIA) epidemic has far-reaching negative health impacts on adults, but
even more so on children, who are facing more PIA than ever in diverse forms. Although the
detrimental impacts of PIA on postnatal muscle are pronounced, and the negative impacts on
bone are well established across the lifecycle, the impact of early-life PIA on muscle and metabolic
health in adulthood is not fully realized. Thus, our objectives are 1) to investigate the effect of
the level of early-life physical inactivity in mice on the muscle quality and function phenotype in
adulthood, 2) to determine the root of muscle quality losses by examining the regulatory aspects
of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in adulthood, 3) to investigate the effect of the level of early-life
physical inactivity on frailty development and survival and 4) to expose undergraduate students
to meritorious biomedical research methods. We have piloted early-life PIA experiments, physical
performance tests, immunofluorescence methods, and data analysis with undergraduate
researchers and are prepared to complete this proposal. We have preliminary data indicating that
brief (2wk) early life PIA in mice produces weaker muscles, reduced muscle quality, increased
ECM, and decreased muscle macrophages 5 months later as adults. This equates to about half
a year of PIA during the first few years of life and early adulthood is about 25-30y of age for a
human. Our preliminary data suggest a concerning trajectory potentially characterized by
attenuated muscle quality and function -- all of which are associated with premature aging and
the possibility of rapid development of frailty and reduced lifespan. Thus, we aim to characterize
how the level of early life PIA, roughly equivalent to ~6 months human child, will contribute to
muscle quality (ECM changes) and physical function losses resulting from brief (2 weeks) early
life PIA during a key period of development in early adulthood (6 mo). The early life PIA will be
conducted with three levels of intensity with muscle disuse, reduced activity, and sedentary cage
activity compared to active control with running wheel access. We will examine skeletal muscle
ECM collagen content and structure, muscle macrophages, and ECM regulation in adult male
and female mice exposed to brief early-life PIA. Lastly, we will use physical performance testing
throughout aging to examine the effect of the development of frailty and survival curves in mice
exposed to brief early-life PIA"
10871387,"Abstract. Alcohol consumption is a predominant etiological factor in the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases.
The progressive nature of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) has been well described, but the complex
interactions under which these pathologies evolve remain only partially elucidated. Based on our preliminary
study, free nucleosides and nucleosides hydrolyzed from total RNA are altered in mice treated with alcohol and
in a human liver cell line, HepaRG, treated with acetaldehyde. We also observed significant changes in the
serum and urine of patients with different stages of ALD. Therefore, we hypothesize that alcohol consumption
affects RNAs' chemical modification and contributes to ALD development and progression. To prove this
hypothesis, we will treat mice with alcohol and first map the chemical modifications on RNAs by isolating different
types of RNAs from mouse liver, digesting them into nucleosides and oligonucleotides, and detecting the site-
specific modification on each RNA using comprehensive 2DLC-MS (Aim 1). And then, RNA modification variation
will be studied between alcohol fed and normal fed mice at the RNA level, and the underlying mechanism will be
uncovered by detecting the expression of the corresponding enzymes (Aim 2).

 Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate the bi-directional transport of proteins, RNAs and ribonucleoprotein
complexes across the double-membrane nuclear envelope of eukaryotic cells. Consequently, NPCs are
essential for the ability of many biosynthetic, signaling and gene regulatory processes to maintain cellular health
and viability. Protein mis-localization due to recognition defects or altered NPC structure and function is linked
to diseases as diverse as primary biliary cirrhosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), leukemias and cancers,
and Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases. While the protein components of the NPC and many soluble nuclear
transport factors have been identified and extensively studied, the mechanism(s) by which bi-directional transport
occurs without clogging the pore remains unknown. The NPC has an octagonally symmetric approximately
cylindrical structure with an hourglass-shaped central pore that has an internal minimal diameter of ~50-60 nm
in humans. Occluding this pore and decorating its exits is a network of > 200 mobile intrinsically disordered
polypeptides with thousands of phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat motifs that provide binding sites for the nuclear
transport receptors (NTRs) that carry cargos through the NPC. At steady-state, up to ~100 NTRs are
asymmetrically distributed throughout this FG-network. The heterogeneous and dynamic NTR/FG-network
establishes a permeability barrier while simultaneously providing pathways for the translocation of import and
export complexes of a wide range of sizes, affinities and surface properties. Multiple preferred paths through
the central pore exist. However, the overlap, selectivity, and geometric and functional properties of these
translocation conduits are largely unexplored due to the historical absence of technological tools to dissect these
pathways with the necessary spatial and temporal resolution. To address this deficiency, a multi-color three-
dimensional (3D) super-resolution fluorescence microscopy approach was developed in the last grant period
that is capable of determining the position and orientation of individual functional NPCs combined with single
particle trajectories of transiting cargo. This approach will be used to determine the structural and functional
properties of multiple translocation conduits and the FG-network barrier. The Specific Aims are: 1) to determine
the number and nature of protein translocation conduits; and 2) to determine the FG-polypeptide and NTR
distributions within the FG-network. Aim 1 seeks to explore the possibility of at least three distinct translocation
conduits, whether some of these consist of 8 distinct channels, and whether any are dedicated to either import
or export. Aim 2 seeks to determine how the physical arrangement and properties of components of the FG-
network are linked to promoting the identified translocation conduits. This work will directly address whether
preferred routes through the permeability barrier provide a means to avoid the competition and clogging expected
for two-way traffic through the same channel. In addition, improved super-resolution microscopy technologies
and algorithms are expected to comprise a necessary toolkit for the field as well as to have broad applicability."

This grant application is focused on capillary malformation (CM), a sporadic, non-hereditary vascular anomaly
affecting 1/300 newborns. CMs are present at birth and may affect any area of skin. They grow darker and
thicker over time. The lesions contain excessive, enlarged capillary-like vessels and cause soft-tissue and
skeletal overgrowth. Patients suffer severe psychosocial morbidity from the appearance of the lesions and
associated overgrowth can cause bleeding and functional disability. Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) affects 1
in 20,000 to 50,000 individuals and is characterized by a facial CM with extension to either the brain and/or
eyes. Patients with SWS may develop neurological impairment, seizures, glaucoma, and blindness. CM is
caused by a somatic activating mutation in GNAQ (p.R183Q) that is enriched in the endothelial cell (EC).
GNAQ encodes Gαq, the α- subunit of the heterotrimeric Gq protein that activates phospholipase Cβ. The
overactivation of Gαq leads to a strong increase in ANGPT2 expression. Drugs do not exist for CM and
management consists of pulse-dye laser to lighten its color and surgical removal. Seizures in SWS are
controlled by anti-epileptic drugs. Pharmacotherapy is desperately needed to prevent CM progression and
recurrence following traditional treatments. Completion of these studies will be major steps towards this goal.
Aim 1 will create a cell-based assay for EC dysfunction in CM/SWS using GFP knocked into the ANGPT2
locus as an easily detectable readout. We will use this cell system for high-throughput screening of FDA-
approved drugs and bioactive compounds. This could lead to the identification of druggable pathways. Our
understanding of how CM forms and grows, as well as our ability to test potential drug treatments, is hampered
by the absence of a mouse model. Aim 2 will focus on creating CMs in mice. We have generated a mouse line
in which we can activate expression of Gαq-R183Q in ECs using Cdh5CreER. To turn on Gαq-R183Q
expression in a manner that produces CMs resembling the human condition we will use topical tamoxifen. We
will test different doses of tamoxifen and time points (new-born to adult). We also will induce CM formation by
injection of Adenovirus-Cdh5Cre into the limbs of prenatal and postnatal animals, as well as into the brain of
ROSA-GT-GNAQ-R183Q animals to obtain a SWS phenotype. Creation of an animal model will enable future
studies to test drug candidates from Aim 1 for their ability to stop the formation and growth of CMs. The most
efficacious drugs will be translated to humans and undergo clinical trials."

their chosen careers."
10875804,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Craniofacial malformations are among the most common human birth defects. Tissues of the head and neck
derive from the pharyngeal arches (PAs). PAs are transient developmental structures formed by mesenchymal
populations, the neural crest (NC) and mesoderm, that migrate in between epithelial layers, the surface
ectoderm and foregut endoderm. Our work focuses on the jaw skeleton, which derives from NC of the first
pharyngeal arch (PA1). Pharyngeal epithelia have at least 3 critical roles in jaw development: 1) segmenting
PA1 from PA2, 2) providing signals that support patterning and proliferation of PA1 mesenchyme, and 3)
subsequently differentiating into tissue derivatives of the ear. To better understand how pharyngeal epithelia
regulate jaw development, we investigate the development and morphogenesis of the first pharyngeal pouch
(pp1) and first pharyngeal cleft (pc1), which segment PA1 and PA2. The signaling factor, Fgf8, is expressed in
both pp1 and pc1. Our previous work has shown that jaw development is sensitive to Fgf8 dosage and exhibits
directional asymmetry, with the left side being more severely affected than the right. Similar directional
asymmetry trends are observed in human craniofacial malformations. We also found that Fgf8-mediated
defects of the jaw skeleton are associated with 1) alterations to patterning of PA1 NC and 2) malformations in
both pp1 and pc1. Our data indicate that Fgf8 is critical to pp1 and pc1 development, but the specific cellular
mechanisms mediated by Fgf8 are unknown. In our previous work, we defined 4 stages of pp1 and pc1
morphogenesis, including an extended period of contact between pp1 and pc1, which is disrupted in Fgf8
mutants. The interaction between pp1 and pc1 is transient, as the two epithelia later separate to complete their
differentiation. We hypothesize that Fgf8 is required to mediate regional cell identity in pp1 and pc1 to form a
boundary and mediate epithelial extension. In Aim 1, we will further explore how Fgf8 dosage impacts
epithelial cell biology. A second aspect of our previous work that remains unexplained is the mechanism
underlying directional asymmetry in Fgf8 mutant jaws. In Aim 2, we will further explore how Fgf8 dosage
contributes to directional asymmetry in jaw development. We hypothesize that progenitors of the heart field
migrating through PA1 provide small amounts of Fgf8 that buffer PA1 development when Fgf8 dosage is low.
Finally, in Aim 3, we will begin to explore how Fgf8 dosage is further modulated through splice variants. Fgf8
mRNA exhibits splice variants. The two most common protein isoforms, FGF8a and FGF8b, have distinct ERK
signaling activity. These data suggest that mRNA splicing may modulate Fgf8 dosage beyond the cis-
regulatory mechanisms we have previously studied. We will use both in vivo and in vitro models to test our
Aims. This work has implications for craniofacial disease syndromes that also include heart defects, such as
CHARGE and DiGeorge (22q11 deletion) syndromes. These syndromes also exhibit asymmetry in jaw and ear
defects."
10875806,"ABSTRACT
The replication cycle of retrovriuses is unique among mammalian viruses in the obligatory step of integrating a
chromosomal copy of the infecting viral genome as a provirus. Consequently, infection of germline DNA may
lead to a provirus that is transmitted to the host’s offspring. The integrant is thereafter referred to as an
endogenous retrovirus (ERV) and may, over time, reach species fixation. ERVs have contributed to abundant
proportions of many species’ genomes (e.g., over 8 and 10% of the human and mouse genomes, respectively)
and are recognized as mediators of genomic variation and disease. ERV-encoded gene functions have been
multiply co-opted for roles of syncytial formation, receptor blocking and other modes of protection, as well as
immune modulation; their regulatory structures have been coopted for functions in gene activation, enhancers,
and splice sites. Expressed ERV products are also present in cancers. In humans, ERVs are deregulated in
cancers in the form of RNAs, enzyme activities, and even particles in tumor-matched studies. While the
consequences of this expression being disentangled, it is clear from animal models of human disease that
replicative activity and proteins derived from related ERVs cause aberrant cellular proliferation, drive
tumorigenesis, and to incite immune responses. Thus, animal models are essential to our understanding of
ERV-host outcomes and to establish links between closely related HERV groups and disease. The genomes of
several species, including human, are known to harbor ERV lineages with recent or ongoing infectious activity.
These lineages tend to include copies with insertional polymorphism (i.e., unfixed), conserved sequence, as
well as open reading frames (ORFs). In the domestic dog, retroviral particles and enzyme activity have been
reported in lymphomas and canine cell lines support retrovirus replication from several host species including
human. Early claims of dog XRVs were not substantiated, and consequently retrovirus interplay in this species
have been ignored. Thus, there is a significant gap in our understanding of virus-host relationships in this
species. We have shown retroviruses have indeed recently infected canines as evident from high levels of an
unfixed g-like ERV in dog genomes, ERV-Fc1, a chimeric ERV related to the human gERV-W(syncytin-like;
env) and gERV-Fc (LTRs, gag, pro/pol) associated with human cancers. Mobilization of existing ERVs by
complementation had a significant role in Fc1 expansion in the dog. We show that Fc1 are expressed and
significantly upregulated in canine tumors, including ones that possess ORFs. The objective of this proposal is
to span an existing knowledge gap by characterizing virus-host coevolution and impact in a uniquely opportune
context of the dog by: 1) characterizing the functional properties of naturally occurring and reconstructed
genes; 2) defining Fc1 promoter activities; 3) examining the outcomes of ERV deregulation in health and
disease. This work has significance to advance basic and clinical research fronts in ERV activities, functions,
and pathogenicity in the dog model and a variant resource for human comparative analyses."
10875928,"ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, decreased quality of life,
and increased health care utilization and cost. Food insecurity, defined as limited or uncertain access to
adequate food for an active, healthy life, is reported by nearly one third of adults with cardiovascular disease in
the United States and is associated with increased 10-year cardiovascular disease risk and increased risk of
death. Current interventions in adults with food insecurity focus on identification and referral, food
supplementation, or access to food options at the community level through grocery stores or rebates. However,
these interventions do not address poverty as an underlying driver of food insecurity and do not target long-
term CVD risk reduction, especially in African Americans. As a result, there is an urgent need to develop
interventions that address food insecurity and account for underlying poverty while targeting CVD risk factor
reduction. Two emerging research areas that have the potential to bridge the gap in terms of anchoring food
insecurity within poverty and targeting CVD risk reduction are income supplementation and behavioral
economics. Income supplementation focuses on providing supplemental income to support immediate
consumption, maintain a basic living standard, or build long-term security. Evidence from recent studies show
that small amounts of income supplementation (~$100/month) are associated with significant reduction in food
insecurity. Preliminary data from our group and a pilot study of the proposed intervention suggests feasibility,
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in improving outcomes among food insecure adults. The proposed study
- Cardiovascular risk reduction for adults with food insecurity using structured incentives (CVD-FIT) - will test a
novel, multi-component intervention that includes three components: 1) monthly income supplementation; 2)
weekly structured incentive for the purchase of healthy food options; and 3) evidence-based telephone
delivered CVD risk reduction education and skills training in African Americans with food insecurity. 200 African
American at risk for CVD with food insecurity will be randomized 1:1 to CVD-FIT or enhanced usual care (CVD
risk reduction education). Primary outcomes include 10-year CVD risk reduction, quality of life, and cost
effectiveness. AIM 1: Test the efficacy of CVD-FIT on improving 10-year CVD risk in African Americans at risk
for CVD with food insecurity using the Pooled Cohort Equations. AIM 2: Test the efficacy of CVD-FIT on
improving quality of life in African Americans at risk for CVD with food insecurity. AIM 3: Test the cost-
effectiveness of CVD-FIT in in African Americans at risk for CVD with food insecurity. Exploratory analyses will
examine mediators (e.g., HbA1c, blood pressure, lipids, healthy eating index, perceived stress) and
moderators (e.g., age, sex, socioeconomic status) on intervention effect."
10881635,"Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this application is to investigate the roles of miR-15a in colorectal
cancer and to develop novel miR-15a mimic as potential therapeutics to treat advanced metastatic colorectal
cancer in both male and female Veterans. Despite advancements in early detection and improved treatment
strategies, there are still 50,260 deaths due to colorectal cancer in the United States, and its incidence is
equally high in the Veteran population. Resistance to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is one of the major
causes for the failure of treating advanced metastatic colorectal cancer. It has been recognized recently that
epigenetic alterations play a key role in tumorigenesis and resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) based
chemotherapy. Because colorectal cancer cells are highly heterogeneous, chemotherapy can be quite effective
in eliminating most of the rapid proliferating cancer cells. However, a small population of slow proliferating
cancer stem cells are highly resistant which leads to cancer recurrence. Although the mechanism of
chemoresistance is complex and is often associated with elevated target enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS,
TYMS), recent studies from our laboratory have shown that epigenetic alterations such as changes in
expression of non-coding miRNAs are major contributors to such resistance mechanisms to 5-FU by providing
acute changes in protein synthesis at the post-transcriptional and translational levels. miRNAs are a class of
small non-coding RNAs with crucial regulatory functions. We have identified a number of miRNAs with tumor
suppressive functions in colorectal cancer. In particular, we have demonstrated that miR-15a (hsa-miR-15a-5p)
can overcome chemoresistance in colorectal cancer as a potent tumor suppressor by inhibiting the expression
of several major therapeutic target genes (BMI1, BCL2, YAP1, DCLK1) and associated pathways. More
importantly, we have recently developed a novel strategy to create modified miRNA mimics with enhanced
stability and efficacy for eliminating 5-FU resistant colon cancer stem cells while retaining target specificity.
miR-15a mimics were designed by modifying the target strand of miR-15a by replacing uracil (U) bases with 5-
FU at various locations. The rationale behind this approach is that 5-FU modification of miR-15a will enhance
stability, and also combining the power of 5-FU and multi-targeted miR-15a into one entity to create therapeutic
synergy, as miR-15a will breakdown eventually to release 5-FU. A unique feature of the 5-FU modified miR-
15a is that it can be internalized by colon cancer cells without any delivery vehicle. This represents a major
advancement and a paradigm shift in miRNA based therapeutic development. Our preliminary results show
that such modification improves the potency and stability of the miR-15a mimic and enhances its ability to
inhibit colon cancer metastasis in vivo without any observed toxicity. Specific Aim 1: We will define the direct
targets and pathways of miR-15a and miR-15a mimic in colon cancer and characterize the effects of miR-15a
mimic on apoptosis, cell cycle control, and chemoresistance in colon cancer cells and 3D organoids. Specific
Aim 2: We will investigate the toxicity, pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of miR-15a mimic in vivo colon
cancer mouse models. Specific Aim 3: We will develop and characterize the therapeutic potential of miR-15a
mimic in metastatic colorectal cancer using in vivo colon cancer mouse models."
10881636,"The complement system is a collection of proteins that constitute a central component of the immune system
involved in both innate and adaptive immunity. One function of the complement system is host-defense and the
destruction of pathogens, but under certain conditions complement is aberrantly activated, resulting in the
destructive force of the complement system being redirected toward self-tissue. This pathological activation of
complement is, and will continue to be, my primary research focus. The over-arching goals of my activities are
to better understand complement-mediated injury mechanisms, and to develop safe and effective therapeutics
based on targeted inhibition of complement. Currently, and for the foreseeable future, my focus will be to
investigate how complement is activated, how it propagates injury, and how it modulates repair following
stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and vascularized composite allograft transplantation. These are all areas of
research highly relevant to Veteran health and healthcare. An added theme throughout these investigations will
continue to be the development and characterization of complement inhibitors, for both therapeutic application
and for use as tools to investigate complement-dependent disease mechanisms under clinically relevant
conditions. A particular focus will be the development of injury-site targeted complement inhibitors that provide
safer and more effective option than systemic complement inhibition. Some of the approaches developed in
the laboratory are in commercial development. More specifically, current and planned research activities are:
 Traumatic Brain Injury: 1. Investigate how the different complement pathways and activation products
contribute to neuroinflammation and promote neurodegeneration after TBI. 2. Investigate the spatiotemporal
pattern of complement deposition after TBI and the relationship with neuroinflammatory markers in
complement-sufficient and complement-inhibited brains. 3. Investigate the role of a complement-microglial axis
in the neurodegenerative loss of neurons and synapses after TBI. 4. investigate neuroinflammation-mediated
neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in chronic traumatic brain injury. 5. Investigate visual dysfunction as it
relates to TBI.
 Stroke: 1. Investigate the effects of age and smoking on acute and chronic complement-dependent
neuroinflammation after stroke, and investigate the effect of complement modulation in the setting of age and
smoking co-morbidities. 2. Investigate how complement and a modified neuroinflammatory response induced
by age and cigarette smoke exposure interact with the current standard of care reperfusion therapies and
rehabilitation. 3. Investigate complement inhibition as a chronic treatment strategy for stroke, and the role of
complement in both injury and repair. 4. Investigate the correlation between systemic complement activity and
serum levels of complement activating natural IgM antibodies with stroke outcomes in acute stroke patients
with co-morbidities.
 Vascularized composite allograft transplantation: Use mouse models of limb transplantation to: 1.
Investigate the role of complement and donor brain death in ischemia reperfusion injury to grafts. 2. Develop
and characterize a novel dual function targeting approach for delivery of complement inhibitors to vascularized
composite allograft. 3. Investigate how brain death, complement and early allograft injury affect acute
vascularized composite allograft rejection and parameters of required immunosuppressive treatment. 4.
Investigate how complement and alloimmunity, and their modulation, affect hindlimb functional recovery in the
context of immunosuppressive treatment. 5. Develop a novel approach to prevent graft rejection while
minimizing or eliminating the need for systemic immunosuppression."

The overall goal of the Rutgers Biotechnology Training Program is to provide outstanding predoctoral students
with an integrated multidisciplinary educational and research training experience in biotechnology. The specific
aims are to: 1) increase the number of well-trained PhDs able to conduct cutting-edge research in
biotechnology and related areas; 2) to increase the number of under-represented minorities receiving
biotechnology related-degrees; and 3) to enhance the overall training experience by re-envisioning predoctoral
education through a diversified set of enrichment activities with appropriate reinforcement throughout the
training period. This comprehensive program builds on our nearly 30 years of prior experience and continuous
NIGMS support in this area. Students in the program receive a broad understanding across biomedical
disciplines and the skills to independently acquire the knowledge needed to advance their field, as well as the
ability to think critically and independently, and to identify important research questions and approaches that
push forward the boundaries in their areas of study. The program provides 2 years of funding to meritorious
students, with the contractual understanding that students will participate in all program activities for their entire
graduate careers. The training experience involves a unifying and multifaceted curriculum which includes: 1)
specialized courses and experiential activities that provide the student with critical perspectives of the field
from multiple vantage points; 2) summer industrial internships; 3) training in responsible conduct of research
and rigor/reproducibility; 4) an annual symposium; and 5) a PhD dissertation research project in one of the
laboratories of our 43 participating faculty mentors who are appointed in many different life science and
engineering departments. We are requesting 13 NIH-funded predoctoral positions per year for 5 years. Rutgers
has committed significant matching fellowship support (7 matching fellowships), stipend and tuition
supplements, and other salary and administrative support. Industrial interaction is exceedingly strong, with
industrial investigators participating in the teaching of courses, presenting at the Annual Symposium, hosting
summer interns, providing matching support, serving on thesis committees, and occasionally hosting students
for a part of their PhD dissertation work. The participating graduate programs and departments, together with
several biotechnology related centers provide exceptional facilities for comprehensive biomedical
biotechnology research and education. Vigorous and extensive recruitment efforts are expended to attract
applicants to the program, and only students of exceptional abilities and motivation are admitted. The program
also vigorously recruits students from under-represented minorities into the biotechnology field with
documented excellent long-term success. Student progress is continuously monitored through progress reports
and via individual development plans. These documents, as well as surveys of the students’ progress in their
careers after they leave the university will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the program."
10881698,"The mission of the NIH is to “…seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.” Achieving this end requires scientists who are not only capable of generating that fundamental knowledge, but also driving the successful translation of that knowledge into therapeutic interventions to reduce illness and disability. The objective of the proposed two-year training program is to provide one pre-doctoral and one post- doctoral/clinical fellow per year with formal education in the translational processes needed for moving basic science discoveries to clinical practice. The program will capitalize on strong translational training opportunities already available at the University of Utah and will complement those opportunities with new programming. Specifically, trainees will benefit from: 1) a series of monthly workshops delivering formal education in the process of moving pharmaceutics, devices, and apps from discovery to clinical use; 2) substantive experiences in clinics, in which patients with disorders of relevance to the trainee’s research are seen and with whom the trainee will engage in the clinic and in patient support groups to gain greater insight into the needs of patients; and 3) an internship to gain first-hand knowledge of the regulatory requirements and practices required to move products through to clinical use. Trainees will conduct their primary research under the direction of a translational supervisory team consisting of a basic scientist, a clinician/clinical scientist, and a researcher with experience in translating basic research discoveries into the clinic. In consultation with this mentoring team, the trainee will design and conduct preclinical research using best practices for enhancing the translational potential of their work. At the end of this training, participants will be able to: 1) Describe the issues to be considered in designing basic, preclinical studies and making decisions about whether to move a preclinical study forward with respect to development of a therapeutic agent, device, or app; 2) Apply knowledge of these considerations to the development of their research proposal; 3) Evaluate the research proposals of others with respect to translational considerations; and 4) Create new knowledge through research and publications that incorporate appropriate translational principles. Together, these experiences will develop burgeoning “professional translators” poised to promote the translation of basic research findings to improved therapeutic outcomes in patients."

With incidence rates more than tripling in the last 45 years, the population of melanoma survivors in the US is
estimated at more than a million persons. Survivors are at elevated risk for recurrence and new primary
cancers. Most recurrent melanomas are found by survivors themselves, which is why physicians educate
survivors about the importance of regular, thorough skin self-exams (SSE) and why professional guidelines for
follow-up surveillance recommend regular, thorough (SSE). More than two thirds of melanoma survivors do not
perform regular, thorough SSE. To address this significant problem, our experienced team developed a digital
intervention, called mySmartSkin (MSS), and tested it in an RCT against usual care in New Jersey. MSS
illustrated promising effects on thorough SSE. In this application, we propose to prepare MSS for large-scale
dissemination using an innovative Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial. A Type 1 hybrid
effectiveness-implementation design allows us to engage multilevel stakeholders throughout the research
process, evaluate the effectiveness of the enhanced MSS, and identify critical factors for wide-scale
implementation. The study’s three aims are guided by implementation frameworks and behavior change
theories. In Aim 1, we will enhance MSS using multi-level stakeholder engagement by collaborating with key
stakeholders in enhancing MSS through qualitative interviews and usability testing of potential enhancements.
Potential enhancements are based on empirically-validated behavior change techniques (BCTs) and findings
from our prior study. We will utilize an iterative process that includes key informant interviews with survivors,
providers, and relevant professional organizations regarding proposed enhancements, conversion to an
enhanced mobile-based intervention delivery platform, usability testing with survivors, and iterative program
refinements. Aim 2 compares the effects of enhanced MSS vs. a non-interactive educational webpage on
comprehensive SSE in an RCT with survivors recruited through two state cancer registries and social media
(N=300). In Aim 3, we identify factors relevant to future scale-up for widespread dissemination and
implementation using mixed methods to assess selected implementation outcomes from the RCT and explore
perspectives from survivors, care providers, and professional organizations about how to best disseminate and
implement MSS on a broad scale. We will estimate program costs and assess cost-effectiveness of MSS. This
project addresses a documented gap in care for melanoma survivors by enhancing effects of a promising
survivor-facing intervention and proactively identifying barriers and facilitators to future implementation. We
innovatively “design for dissemination” by ensuring that enhancements are designed with the target population
of potential users. Serving as a model for optimizing promising fully-automated online interventions for cancer
survivors for dissemination, this project will provide important information about potentially cost-effective ways to
reach survivors as well as about how to adapt such an intervention for dissemination."
10881713,"Osteoporosis (porous bone disease) is a disease of the skeleton that can have debilitating effects on many US
veterans. An estimated 44 million Americans, or 55 percent of the people 50 years of age and older, are
currently at risk for osteoporotic fracture. Improved treatment options for the disease require a greater
understanding of the cellular events and signaling pathways that control bone metabolism. The proposed
research capitalizes on human diseases that result in very high bone mass. The genetic causes of these high
bone mass diseases—craniotubular hyperostosis, hyperostosis corticalis, sclerosteosis, van Buchem’s
disease—provide insight into how bone mass can be manipulated in osteoporotic patients to improve their
skeletal health and prevent fractures. Many of the high-bone-mass associated diseases are caused by
mutations in a cell signaling pathway called “Wnt.” Thus, manipulation of the Wnt pathway holds great promise
for skeletal health improvement. This pathway is particularly attractive as a therapeutic target because it can
be manipulated to increase new bone formation, rather than simply prevent further bone loss. The long term
goals of the proposed project are twofold: first, we seek to understand how the secreted inhibitors of Wnt
signaling function as a coordinated unit (i.e., a milieu), by adjusting their expression levels when other
members of the unit are adjusted (e.g., inhibited or deleted). Those adjustments in expression in the members
of the milieu represent prime targeting opportunities to enact large changes in anabolic action in bone, as our
supporting data suggest. We also seek to understand how this Wnt inhibitor milieu controls the anabolic action
of mechanical loading—a potent anabolic stimulus that has lasting benefits to the skeleton. We seek to
understand whether certain members of the inhibitory milieu function as “homing signals” to ensure that new
bone is added where it is needed most – to the high strain regions of the bone, and that it is not added where it
is not needed – to the low strain regions of the bone. Again, our data suggest that the Wnt inhibitory milieu
plays a significant role in this process. Our second goal of the application is to conduct functional studies
targeting the Wnt inhibitor milieu, that have direct applicability to future therapeutic approaches in patients.
Bone wasting conditions such as mechanical disuse (e.g., bedrest, paralysis) and glucocorticoid therapy (a
drug used for treating inflammation and immunosuppression) are common among veterans. Based on
measurements we and others have made regarding the changes in expression of Wnt inhibitors following
disuse and glucocorticoid exposure, we hypothesize that the “compensatory milieu” of four Wnt inhibitors–Sost,
Dkk1, sFrp4, and Wise—coordinate via unknown mechanisms to prevent anabolic action in the presence of
disuse glucocorticoid therapy. We propose to target the entire milieu in different combinations, to determine
whether we can restore anabolic activity in mice exposed to these bone wasting conditions. If so, those studies
would have far-reaching implications for the design of therapies aimed at treating veterans with disuse- and
glucocorticoid-induced bone deficiencies. Another functional study we will undertake, which also capitalizes on
the biology of the Wnt inhibitor milieu, is to determine whether we can reduce the dose/volume of Sost
antibody required to generate a significant anabolic response by additionally blocking accessory Wnt inhibitors
that are part of the compensatory milieu. We have already shown that we can dramatically increase the
anabolic efficacy of Dkk1 antibody if we use it in the presence of Sost inhibition. We found another inhibitor that
also might participate in compensation – a secreted member of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily known as
Notum. We anticipate a significant osteoanabolic effect using much lower doses of antibody if we
simultaneously block other accessory Wnt inhibitors. In this renewal Merit application, we address these
questions in order to identify new ways to improve bone health among the veteran population, and among the
public in general."
10881715,"Aging is the greatest risk factor for many chronic diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, diabetes,
and heart disease. Currently, roughly half of the VA population is aged 65+ years, and in the next ten years,
more than 3 million of these veterans are expected to be over 75. Thus, studying genes that regulate aging
and aging-associated pathologies is critically important for biomedical advancements to benefit veterans’
health. This research program investigates two such genes, SIRT6 and SIRT7, which are “master
regulators” of many changes in aging tissues, such as DNA damage, metabolic and oxidative stress,
cellular senescence, and inflammation. Our projects study how decreased activity of these genes may
contribute to pathologies in cardiovascular and liver disease, diabetes, obesity, and many cancers, and how
activating these genes could protect against these pathologies. By identifying pathways that can be targeted
for therapy, this research can directly impact the health of the Veteran population.

10878148,"Abstract
Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapies have shown significant promise for the treatment of rare
diseases with unmet medical needs. In recent years, however, multiple reports of treatment-related serious
adverse events have been reported in several clinical trials. A recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
advisory committee meeting highlighted the impact of high vector doses on hepatic and renal toxicities
following AAV gene transfer. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop strategies to achieve therapeutic
efficacy at lower vector dosage. To achieve such, a better understanding of AAV biology in different species is
critical. During the previous funding cycle, we worked towards optimizing preclinical-to-clinical translation of
AAV vectors, which has proven difficult due to incongruent vector transgene expression profiles in different
species. To this end, our lab first developed a body of work based on structure-guided AAV evolution. Then,
we developed a novel, cross-species evolution approach, wherein AAV libraries are cycled sequentially across
mice, pigs and macaques. This approach yielded novel AAV variants that are highly potent and cross-species
compatible (ccAAVs). While the potential for clinical translation at lower vector doses using ccAAVs is exciting,
understanding the mechanism(s) underlying improved transduction efficiency is critical. Over the next 5 years,
we propose to dissect structure-function-mechanism correlates of AAV transduction in mouse and monkey
models. Specifically, we will carry out multi-trait mapping (tropism, transduction, epigenetics, transcription,
immunogenicity) of ccAAVs and related mutants in normal mice, CRISPR-based editor mice and rhesus
macaques. Specifically, we will probe the bold, new concept that AAV capsids can dictate epigenetic fate and
transcriptional activity of vector genomes across different species. Thus, the overarching goal of this
application is to better understand the structure-function-mechanism nexus in AAV biology to enable improved
vector design."
10878246,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is one of the first cytokines reported nearly 60 years ago. Yet, it
took 40 years to find out its receptor CD74. CD74 is also called invariant chain that chaperones MHC-II
maturation from ER to endosome/lysosome where CD74 gets degraded by cathepsins. CD74 does not contain
a signaling component on its short cytoplasmic tail. This nature of CD74 inspired later discoveries that CD74
does not work alone, but forms complexes with CD44 and chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4. Since we
first reported a direct role for MIF in atherosclerosis, and suggested MIF activity in abdominal aortic aneurysms
(AAA) at the time of the CD74 report, we have also started searching for novel MIF receptors. Using mouse
aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and recombinant MIF as bait, we discovered a 110-kDa MIF-binding protein:
chloride channel accessory protein-1 (CLCA-1). We initially thought it might be a new MIF receptor. CLCA1 is
a Ca2+-activated chloride channel (CaCC) expressed in airway epithelial cells, where it lowers the energy
barriers for ion transportation as a mechanism to enhance mucin expression and respiratory dysfunction.
CLCA1 contains three domains: the CLCA-N domain located on the N-terminus with metallo-hydrolase activity
that cleaves CLCA1 into two pieces, the 75-kDa N-terminal fragment and 35-kDa C-terminal fragment, the von
Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain within the 75-kDa fragment to engage the channel to increase Ca2+-
dependent Cl– current, and the fibronectin type-III (FN-III) domain within the 35-kDa C-terminal fragment with
untested function. Although CLCA1 is not a MIF receptor as we wished, we found that the 35-kDa fragment
binds to MIF and acts as a decoy inhibitor that blocks MIF-induced macrophage expression of cytokines and
chemokines. We did not detect significant correlations between plasma 35-kDa CLCA1 fragments with AAA
size or AAA growth rate from an AAA screening trial, but plasma 75-kDa fragment levels correlated strongly
with AAA size and growth rate. We revealed deficiency of the 35-kDa fragment in human and mouse AAA
lesions. This fragment is expressed in ECs and SMCs from healthy or diseased aortas. In contrast, the 75-kDa
fragment is expressed mainly in macrophages. In CaPO4 injury-induced AAA, MIF deficiency (Mif–/–) reduced
AAA growth, but CLCA1 deficiency (Clca1–/–) expedited AAA growth. The increased AAA growth in Clca1–/–
mice was fully muted in the absence of MIF (Clca1–/–Mif–/–). CLCA1 with mutations at the cleavage site or the
protease active site failed to undergo self-cleavage. CLCA1 knock-in at the cleavage site or protease active
site increased AAA growth. We hypothesize that, instead of serving as a MIF receptor, CLCA1 uses its C-
terminal 35-kDa FN-III domain-containing fragment to act as a MIF decoy inhibitor that binds to MIF, blocks
MIF-induced activation of aortic wall inflammatory and vascular cells, and slows AAA growth. We proposed two
Aims to examine the decoy inhibitory role of CLCA1 and its 35-kDa FN-III fragment in MIF-induced AAA and to
explore CLCA1 fragment-mediated decoy inhibition of MIF activity on macrophages and vascular cells."
10878540,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of Acute Lung Injury (ALI), characterized by injury
to endothelial cells (ECs) in the lungs that leads to vascular leakage and pulmonary edema. Currently, effective
treatments for ARDS are lacking, highlighting the urgent need for innovative strategies that focus on rejuvenating
EC regeneration and repairing blood vessels. Perivascular macrophages (PVMs), a specific subset of
macrophages located near blood vessels, are known to influence vascular function. However, their specific role
in endothelial repair during ARDS remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the hypothesis that PVMs
play a critical role in promoting EC regeneration and vascular repair following ALI/ARDS. The specific
aims are as follows:
 1) To determine the regulatory role of PVMs in promoting EC regeneration and vascular repair after
 ALI, we will use intravital microscopy imaging to observe the dynamic interactions between PVMs and
 ECs in live mouse lungs. We will conduct loss-of-function studies by genetically removing PVMs from the
 lungs, and gain-of-function studies by transferring PVMs into lungs using ALI models.
 2) To elucidate the specific mechanisms through which PVMs contribute to endothelial regeneration
 and vascular repair, we will investigate the involvement of exosomes released by PVMs and their
 primary cargo, Glutaminase, in facilitating communication between PVMs and ECs. Additionally, we will
 explore the impact of glutamine metabolism and associated changes in epigenetic regulation within ECs,
 which are driven by exosomal Glutaminase and crucial for promoting EC regeneration.
The outcomes of this project will have significant implications for the fields of macrophage biology and endothelial
research. Ultimately, this study aims to identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of ARDS, addressing
the critical need for effective interventions in this life-threatening condition."
10881658,"This proposed Research Career Scientist award is to support the activities of Dr. Nihal Ahmad, an
established Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) investigator, allowing him to expand his scientific, mentoring
and service contributions. Dr. Ahmad’s long-term goal is to improve the quality of human life, including that of
Veterans, through my research. Dr. Ahmad’s laboratory focuses on two broad and complementary research
areas: 1) cancer biology and 2) prevention and experimental therapeutics of cancer. The major goal of his
ongoing research is to define the critical molecular and biochemical events that occur during cancer
development and progression to help identify novel targets and strategies for cancer management. While Dr.
Ahmad’s laboratory is involved in understanding epithelial cancer in general, his major recent focus has been
on skin- and prostate- cancers, both of which disproportionally affect the Veteran population.
 Dr. Ahmad’s current VA sponsored research focuses on identifying the mechanism of melanoma
development and progression. Importantly, melanoma is among the five most frequently diagnosed cancers
among VA cancer patients. In addition, the US military engages in missions all over the world, including
recently in the Middle East (Iraq and Afghanistan). Deployment to these regions is associated with significant
UV radiation exposure that increases the risk for malignant melanoma in the Veterans returning from these
areas. Thus, Dr. Ahmad’s research findings may lead to identification of novel strategies for the management
of this deadly neoplasm; and is relevant and significant to the health care of Veterans and directly in line with
the mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The results of Dr. Ahmad’s research are published in a wide
range of high-impact scientific journals. He has published more than 208 papers, 176 published abstracts and
several book chapters (I have published more than 208 papers, 176 published abstracts and several book
chapters (Total Citations: 28,413; h-index, 83; i10-index: 172; Source: Google Scholar; 08/2021).
 Dr. Ahmad is internationally recognized researcher. He serves as an Associate Editor of multiple well-
respected journals, namely Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology, Journal of Oncology, Journal of Skin
Cancer, and Frontiers in Oncology and Photochemistry and Photobiology, and he is a member of the Editorial
Board for several other journals. He is regularly invited to participate in the peer-review of grants for national
and international funding agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense.
He has recently completed his term as a Charter Member of the Radiation Therapeutics and Biology (RTB)
Study Section of the NIH. In addition, he has mentored numerous junior scientists at all levels (undergraduate,
graduate, post-doctoral, and junior faculty). Most of his previous trainees/mentees have been successful in
obtaining independent positions in academia and industry. In addition, Dr. Ahmad has developed extensive
collaborations with numerous scientists within the VA and at the University of Wisconsin, other universities in
the US, and outside the country (internationally). Most of his collaborations have been very successful
resulting in numerous papers and extramural funding."
10899619,"Anticipated Impact on Veterans Healthcare: Polypharmacy, defined in published studies as more than five
medications, and hyperpolypharmacy, defined as more than 10 medications, are both common in older
patients discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). Several recent studies demonstrate the prevalence and
potential inappropriateness of polypharmacy among older patients in both VA and non-VA healthcare settings.
Other studies have shown that polypharmacy can lead to multiple harmful outcomes among older community-
dwelling and hospitalized populations including decreased medication adherence, increased adverse drug
events and increased health care utilization and costs. Polypharmacy and a variety of drug indices that
quantify drug burden have additionally been found to be associated with the development of the following
geriatric syndromes: cognitive impairment, delirium, falls, urinary incontinence and unintentional weight loss.
Our innovative, patient-centered Drug Reduction in Older Patients (DROP) intervention has significant potential
to impact the health of a large population of older Veterans who are vulnerable to poor health outcomes. It is
during hospitalization and SNF care that older patients often acquire new geriatric syndromes and medications
and, thus, when deprescribing actions should be initiated by VA care providers. In addition, the clinical
oversight provided during the hospital and SNF stays allows the effects of medication changes to be more
closely monitored for safety relative to when the Veteran is at home.
Project Objectives: The proposed randomized, controlled trial will evaluate the effects of an intervention to
reduce exposure to medications (DROP) among hospitalized older Veterans discharged to skilled nursing
facilities (SNFs) using an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design to inform future dissemination efforts.
Project Background/Rationale: Patients discharged to SNF represent the largest segment of Medicare
beneficiaries discharged to post-acute care services and are a particularly high risk group for loss of
independence and other poor clinical outcomes. This investigative team recently completed a VA-funded
Quality Improvement Award and a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Innovation Award, both
of which provide strong preliminary data related to the prevalence of polypharmacy and the relationship
between polypharmacy and geriatric syndromes (e.g., medications associated with falls) in this patient
population. Based on these data, we developed and pilot-tested a patient-centered deprescribing intervention
combined with standardized screening assessments for eight geriatric syndromes to be implemented in the
hospital and monitored during the SNF stay.
Project Methods: We propose an innovative effectiveness-implementation hybrid design study that will be
conducted in one VA hospital. The goal of the proposed DROP intervention is to safely deprescribe
medications, as defined by dose reductions and stopped medications, based on a combination of clinical
criteria and Veteran preferences. This randomized, controlled trial conducted over three years will evaluate the
effects of this hospital-based intervention on medication exposure, medication adherence, geriatric syndromes,
and health status across Veterans’ care transitions from the hospital to SNF to home to include a 90-day
follow-up period after SNF discharge. Our overarching hypothesis is that reducing medications for older
Veterans will favorably impact geriatric syndromes. Additionally, we aim to understand Veteran, both VA and
non-VA provider and system-level factors that facilitate or impede intervention effectiveness to inform future
clinical uptake and dissemination throughout the VA."
10887110,"Project Abstract
Synaptic transmission has been studied for decades, revealing many of the biochemical cascades that trigger
and regulate neurotransmitter release, molecules that are used for neurotransmission and neuromodulation,
and the postsynaptic consequences of binding these signaling molecules to their receptors. Nevertheless,
many aspects of neurotransmission in the mammalian brain are poorly understood and linking the properties of
synapses to the function of circuits, and eventually to behavior, has been difficult. Our studies in the last few
years have revealed many surprising aspects of neurotransmission including that many neuromodulatory
neurons, including midbrain dopaminergic and basal forebrain cholinergic ones, release GABA and sometimes
use atypical methods of GABA handling. Furthermore, somatostatin neurons of the entopeduncular nucleus
release both GABA and glutamate whereas cholinergic interneurons of cortex are actually a subclass of
vasoactive intestinal peptide GABAergic interneurons. Thus, there are many mysteries surrounding the
neurotransmitter identity of neurons in the mammalian brain as well as how these unexpected features provide
mammalian circuits with specialized functions. Here we propose to use a variety of approaches to understand
the identity of neurons in the mouse brain and how their specialized properties endow the brain with unique
features. The proposed studies build on approximately 20 years of NINDS funded research into the
determinants of the structure and function of mammalian synapses."
10887246,"Black women intimate partner violence (IPV) survivors experience a higher burden of depression.1 IPV is any
physical, sexual, psychological, or financial abuse, and/or controlling behaviors inflicted by a current or former
intimate partner.2 Women bear the brunt of victimization. More than 43 million women in the United States (US)
have experienced IPV in their lifetime.2 Every year 12.5 million women are abused.3 Depression is the leading
cause of disability in the US affecting more than 20% of the population.6,7 Women are nearly twice as likely as
men to suffer from it.8 Black women who are exposed to severe, long-term IPV and are also more likely to suffer
from severe depression.1 Depression is especially harmful for IPV survivors because it undermines a woman’s
ability to safely escape from an abusive partner.10 Depression is especially pernicious for Black women IPV
survivors. Given their race-class-gender intersectionality, they are often misdiagnosed, undertreated, and
experience bias from mental health (MH) providers despite experiencing higher rates of psychological distress.8
Notably, existing and long-standing inequities within the mental healthcare system make it especially difficult for
them to obtain immediate depression care. However, the Black church is a trusted and novel pathway for
providing treatment linkages for depressed community members.14-16 Nearly 80% of Blacks are religiously
affiliated and women are the largest population within the Black church.27 Women clergy are already providing
crisis support for IPV survivors.28,29 They view this as part of their social responsibility to support other women30
although depression is not currently addressed. Notably, there is a dearth of depression care that has been
tailored for Black women IPV survivors in the Black church.36 Current interventions largely omit Black women’s
spirituality, despite their preference for incorporating faith-based practices.23,36 In fact, interventions that infuse
Black IPV survivors' spiritual and religious practices increase the likelihood of treatment adherence and
completion.36 This finding is consistent with cultural norms and reliance upon the Black church as a source of
support that includes healthcare promotion and delivery, sociopolitical organizing, as well as educational and
childcare services.37,38 Given that tailored interventions increase trust and decrease the likelihood of attrition
among this underserved population of survivors in critical need of MH care,26,39 there is an urgent need to tailor
an EBI for Black women IPV survivors with depression in the context of the Black church. In this K23 patient-
oriented application guided by community-partnered participatory research and Waller’s Model,41 I will apply the
ADAPT-ITT Model23 and the PRISM framework48,49 to tailoring and implementing interpersonal counseling
(IPC)21 – a brief, structured version of interpersonal psychotherapy22 designed for nonspecialist settings that
focuses on interpersonal problems and depressive symptoms21 – for depressed Black women IPV survivors that
can be delivered by church leaders in a novel, faith-based setting. The outcomes from this work will provide pilot
data for an R01 to evaluate the tailored intervention in a fully powered, cluster-randomized trial in Black churches."
10886278,"Project Summary
Oral cavity reconstruction (OCR), which involves open surgical resection of oral cancer with vascularized tissue
flap reconstruction, remains a central component of oncologic management. However, a main source of peri-
operative morbidity after such surgeries is surgical site infection (SSI), which continues to occur in at least 20%
of cases nationwide. Post-operative SSI leads to significant physical, psychosocial, and financial burdens on
patients and may compromise cancer control by delaying necessary post-operative radiation.
In OCR, there are multiple opportunities for bacterial contamination of the surgical field leading to SSI. While
common oral microbiota can cause SSI, most infections are due to pathogens not typically found among the
healthy oral microbiome, such as Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas spp. The source of these bacteria and their
mechanism of infection have not been established. To reduce SSI after OCR, and thereby prevent patient
suffering, limit healthcare costs, and avoid delays in necessary post-operative radiation, we must address these
significant gaps in current knowledge. Our preliminary studies suggest that the oral environment is the likely
source of such infections and that genomic techniques can be used to track bacterial strains across the treatment
period. Building on our preliminary data, we propose a study with the following specific aims: Aim 1) Identify the
peri-operative source of bacteria which lead to SSI after OCR in oral cancer patients; and Aim 2) Determine the
mechanisms of bacterial antibiotic resistance in oral cancer patients who develop SSI after OCR.
Patients planned for standard of care OCR will be recruited to undergo peri-operative bacterial sampling,
including skin, oronasal, and pharyngoesophageal sites. For patients who experience SSI, the purulence from
the infection will also be sampled. In Aim 1, we will determine which peri-operative sites may be the source of
infection. We will accomplish this first by testing peri-operative samples for the presence of bacteria known to
cause SSI after OCR. Then, we will more precisely identify the site and mechanism by matching the genome
sequence of the infectious bacteria to identical strains among the peri-operative microbiota. In Aim 2, we will
investigate the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. We will determine if insufficient antibiotic penetration is an
etiology of infection by quantifying ampicillin/sulbactam concentrations in both tissue and blood during surgery.
Next, we will examine genetic resistance mechanisms by identifying and tracking antibiotic resistance genes
harbored by infectious organisms across the treatment period.
These data will illuminate the potential source of bacteria that lead to SSI after OCR and will further develop the
mechanisms leading to infection. This will provide a strong foundation to design precision therapeutics in future
studies to better prevent SSI after OCR. These interventions may include targeted antiseptics and improved
methods of antibiotic delivery."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a severe genetic blood condition that primarily affects people of African descent.
Adults affected by SCD are not only subject to significant morbidity and at risk for early mortality, but this
patient population also experiences discrimination and significant disparities in health care. Communication
between patients living with SCD and their healthcare providers (HCPs) plays a critical role in treatment
adherence and disease outcomes; the interactions between patients with SCD and HCPs are often of poor
quality, strained, and at times even confrontational. These negative interactions may be detrimental to patient
self-care. However, little is known about patient-provider communication (PPC) needs among patients with
SCD, and few studies have addressed the need for tools to help patients with SCD communicate with their
HCPs. Tools designed to guide the patient’s communication have the potential to improve self-efficacy and
self-care, thereby improving health outcomes. SBAR3 is a communication strategy designed to be used across
diverse patient populations to improve communication and health outcomes. The SBAR3 acronym stands for
Share your story, Bring your background, Ask for what you want or need, Review the plan, Reflect on whether
it is right for you, and Repeat the plan. While SBAR3 has been successfully tested in other chronic disease
populations as a serious game or digital health intervention, it has not been implemented in patients with SCD,
nor taught as a face-to-face intervention. This K99 study will fill this evidence gap by assessing communication
needs in SCD care, adapting the SBAR3 intervention to meet these expressed needs, and evaluating the
feasibility and acceptability of the adapted intervention to promote assertive communication among patients
with SCD and their HCPs in outpatient care. The K99 specific aims will be achieved using qualitative and
human centered design (HCD) methods to work with stakeholders to (1) assess the communication needs of
patients with SCD, and (2) to ensure that the SBAR3 intervention is engaging and acceptable. The R00 aim
will (3) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted SBAR3 intervention in a randomized controlled
trial. The training activities, mentoring team, and training environment will support the applicant in the
development of the expertise and skills related to (a) HCD and qualitative methods, (b) PPC among diverse
populations, and (c) design and conduct of multisite clinical trials. Completion of the proposed training and
research will provide the applicant with the skills, knowledge, and data to launch a successful program of
research examining the impact of PPC on self-care management and health outcomes in patients with SCD.
The K99/R00 will provide the foundation for a large-scale, R01-funded trial testing the effectiveness of the
adapted SBAR3 in SCD care and to further the applicants career focused on improving communication and
disease-related self-care management in vulnerable minority populations managing chronic illness."
10886372,"The prevalence of obesity continues to be higher among Black adults compared to other racial/ethnic
groups in the United States, contributing to multiple health disparities. Strong evidence suggests modest
weight loss achieved through lifestyle behavior changes can reduce the burden of obesity-related conditions
like diabetes, cardiovascular health, and some cancers, yet current standard behavioral weight loss
interventions are not optimized for weight loss among Black adults. Cultural adaptation of these interventions is
recommended to improve weight and weight-related outcomes. Specifically, familial social networks are
considered an important obesity contextual factor to target for Black adults, providing opportunities for
provision of social support, resources for coping with stressors, and positive interdependence in achieving joint
goals. In the few studies incorporating family members in weight loss interventions targeting Black adults,
While this limited research shows promise, the field of family-centered

In these studies, we observed
clinically significant short-term weight loss and improvements in hemoglobin A1c; family interactions; dietary,
physical activity, and diabetes self-care behaviors; session attendance; and self-monitoring behaviors. Building
on these preliminary studies of multicomponent interventions, we propose applying two innovative
methodologies to optimize a family-centered behavioral weight loss intervention for Black adults. First, using
the engineering-inspired, Multiphase Optimization STrategy (MOST) and a highly efficient experimental design,
we will identify which levels and combinations of 4 intervention components yield the greatest weight loss at 6
months. Black adults (n=256 dyads, 512 individuals--index participant with %0,  30 kg/m2; dyad partner with
BMI  27.5 kg/m2) will receive a core behavioral weight loss intervention and be randomized to 4 additional
components: 1) number of family skills sessions (10 vs. 5), 2) delivery mode (in-person vs. online), 3) family
communication/conflict skills training (yes vs. no), and 4) family cohesion skills training (yes vs. no). Second,
by augmenting the optimization trial with Social Network Analysis (SNA), we will identify the types of
interactions dyad members have with their larger social networks (both family and non-family) and how these
interactions influence their health and weight loss behaviors. Evidence generated will yield an optimized family-
centered intervention for Black adults that can be fully evaluated in a subsequent randomized controlled trial."

Children with autism and anxiety exhibit significantly more self-injurious behavior, more depressive symptoms,
poorer relationships with teachers, peers, and family members, and higher levels of aggressive behavior
relative to children with autism without anxiety symptoms. Yet, identifying anxiety in autism populations can be
difficult, emphasizing the need for objective measures of anxiety. Additionally, autism research has historically
excluded Black/African American and other minorities. Therefore, investigating developmental risk and
protective factors that are associated with anxiety symptoms within a more racially diverse autistic population is
critical to prevent or reduce negative mental health outcomes. Therefore, the current study aims to collect a
large sample of autistic and nonautistic adolescents to evaluate whether the presence of atypical autonomic
activity is a biomarker of anxiety in autistic youth. This proposal has three aims: 1) to investigate the
association between baseline autonomic activity and anxiety levels in adolescents with and without autism; 2)
to examine the role of ecological context and race and their relation with baseline autonomic activity and
anxiety in adolescents with and without autism; and 3) to utilize real world experience sampling and
noninvasive heart rate monitors to capture real-time data on autonomic activity, anxiety levels, and ecological
context in the natural settings of adolescents with and without autism. Such knowledge will allow for
identification of anxiety in autistic youth that would otherwise be unable to report on anxiety and
inform the development of interventions that are generalizable to a racially diverse population.
In the proposed K08 career development plan, I will undertake training in the Maryland Center for Health
Equity including field observations in the Black/African American community to explore aspects of the
ecological context and how those experiences relate to autonomic activity and anxiety in a racially diverse
sample. Additionally, I will acquire core knowledge in psychophysiology as related to the parasympathetic
nervous system, develop expertise in the assessment of anxiety, receive advanced training in quantitative
methodology for multilevel modeling of intensive longitudinal data, and training in ecological momentary
assessment best practices. Successful completion of these aims would lay the groundwork for validating the
use of autonomic activity as an objective transdiagnostic biomarker of anxiety in autism and contribute to the
development of targeted interventions that promote emotional well-being, empower youth with autism from
diverse backgrounds, and improve their overall quality of life. Completion of the training goals will prepare me
as an independent researcher in the fields of autism, developmental psychopathology, and clinical science with
experience in recruiting and working with diverse populations."

Project ACE (ACtion for Equity: A BUILDing SCHOLARS Pipeline) proposes to create a pipeline of
academically and socially prepared Hispanic students from three economically disadvantaged high schools in
Far West Texas and Southern New Mexico who will pursue undergraduate majors and eventually careers in
biomedical science research. Drawing on The University of Texas at El Paso's (UTEP) BUILDing SCHOLARS
(Building Infrastructure Leading to Diversity: Southwest Consortium of Health-Oriented education Leaders and
Research Scholars) grant and couched in Johnson and Bozeman's (2012) asset bundles framework, Project
ACE is unique because it exposes students to interdisciplinary biomedical research at the high school level;
incorporates their teachers in research experiences; and engages students' families in their academic and
research skills growth. The proposal seeks to accomplish its goal of increasing diversity in the biomedical
sciences through creating a pipeline of prepared Hispanic high school students by: (1) enhancing their high
school teachers' research skills and knowledge of careers in biomedical research through participation in
mentored summer research experiences; (2) fostering a culture of high academic achievement amongst high
school students through rigorous classroom instruction using research-infused curriculum that will be
complemented by tutoring, SAT/ACT preparation and résumé writing; and (3) developing a research culture for
high school students, where high school students will be engaged in research activities. High school students
will be socialized into science through yearly symposia, and interaction with near-peer mentors, graduate
student tutors and UTEP faculty members who will serve as research mentors. This entails a multi-tiered
mentoring approach which involves research to be performed at both the student's high school as well as at
UTEP. By engaging in research at the high school level, we expect to see increased science identity and
research self-efficacy in the participating students; improved research skills and increased interest in
biomedical careers. By fostering a culture of high academic achievement, we expect that participating students
will become more competitive applicants for merit-based scholarship opportunities at the postsecondary level
and be more prepared for the biomedical research workforce. By involving high school teachers in
contemporary biomedical research and infusing research and active learning principles into high school
curriculum, we expect their students to be more engaged in learning, more excited by biomedical research,
and more likely to pursue biomedical majors as undergraduates. This proposal is significant because it will
leverage BUILDing SCHOLARS and NIH-funded programs at UTEP in order to further contribute to the
diversification of the biomedical research workforce."

Tooth decay is the most common chronic disease among U.S. children.2,3 Despite efforts to increase utilization
among minority populations by improving coverage for dental insurance via Medicaid and Children’s Health
Insurance Program (CHIP), large oral health disparities remain with Black and Hispanic children having the
poorest oral health of any racial groups in the US.5-8 In addition to lack of access to recommended care, individual
health behaviors (e.g., poor dietary and oral hygiene) and community- and provider-related structural factors
also contribute to the high risk of severe dental caries in minority populations.6,9 State Medicaid and CHIP dental
programs are encouraged to consider strategies to reduce oral health disparities in their delivery system
improvement efforts,6 however, they are challenged with improving quality and reducing quality disparities among
high-need beneficiaries in a cost-effective way.6 Steps toward successful program improvements include the
ability to validly measure the value of care (defined by both health outcomes and costs) delivered to their
beneficiaries, as well as incorporating racial/ethnic disparities in the assessment. There is a critical gap in our
understanding of the influence of race/ethnicity and its interaction with multilevel risk factors on disparities in
quality and oral health outcomes. The scientific objective of this research plan is to study multilevel determinants
of oral health and disparities in quality of dental care and assess the value of improving care and eliminating
racial/ethnic disparities in quality. In Aim 1, we will develop a risk prediction model of severe dental caries by
applying machine-learning based survival analysis4,10 on electronic health record (EHR) data to understand the
influence of race/ethnicity on progression of severe caries and explore heterogenous treatment effects of dental
care. In Aim 2, we will analyze individual-level claims in Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) data combined with
multiple data sources to comprehensively measure racial/ethnic disparities in overall quality of dental care, using
evidence-based quality indicators, and identify modifiable structural risk factors creating disparities. In Aim 3,
incorporating results from Aims 1 and 2, a microsimulation model of severe caries, integrating individual-level
data with data on key contextual factors, will be developed and used to assess the cost-effectiveness and value
of improvements in care stemming from dental quality measures and eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in
quality. Findings from this study will support decision-making by policymakers and stakeholders, and will form
the basis of an R01 application to study novel strategies that target underserved and vulnerable populations.
This research plan is complemented by a career development plan that builds on the applicant’s background in
health policy and decision science. Specifically, this career development plan outlines new training in three
areas: (1) oral health epidemiology, (2) health disparities research, and (3) advanced analytics methods. The
combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career
identifying, evaluating, and implementing multilevel interventions to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in oral health."

Bacteremia, the presence of living bacteria in blood, can lead to life-threatening sepsis and represents a primary
cause of death despite advances in modern medicine. For the diagnosis of bacteremia, the current gold standard
is blood culture. Unfortunately, blood culture is insensitive and can take up to 5 days to complete. During this
lengthy time window, patients may continue receiving ineffective or unnecessary broad-spectrum antimicrobials,
leading to poor treatment outcomes, adverse iatrogenic effects, and increased selection for multi-drug-resistant
“superbugs”. Molecular diagnostics promise to speed up the diagnosis and improve the treatment of bacteremia.
To date, however, such a promise remains unfulfilled because existing molecular diagnostics cannot
simultaneously accomplish: 1) rapid identification of species of the bacteria from a broad panel of potential
causative bacteria, 2) prompt testing of the susceptibilities of the identified bacteria against various antibacterial
agents, and 3) “needs-driven” versatility to adjust test specifications accordant with clinical context. A better
molecular diagnostic platform is therefore urgently needed for the acute management of bacteremia.
In response, we propose to develop an integrated molecular and single-cell detection platform capable of rapid
bacterial detection, species identification (ID), bacterial load quantification, and antibacterial susceptibility testing
(AST) in a streamlined test that allows customizable workflow. First, the proposed platform will perform bacteria
ID and measure bacterial load from blood via ultrafast magnetofluidic PCR and “probe melt analysis” (PMA)
within a magnetofluidic ID device in 30 min. This device is composed of a low-cost cartridge and an automated
instrument. The cartridge and the instrument are designed to perform bacteria lysis, magnetic-based DNA
extraction and purification, and PCR-PMA – a unique strategy that detects each bacterial species by a DNA
probe with a specific melting temperature and fluorescence color code. The species ID and bacterial load
provides guidance and specifications for downstream AST. Next, the proposed platform will conduct “single-cell
molecular AST” to quantitatively detect bacterial ribosomal RNA as a surrogate viability marker at the single cell
level, which has the potential to accelerate testing time to below the time scale of bacteria replication. Single-cell
molecular AST will be performed within a microfluidic chip and a companion instrument that can automate the
assay steps – including antibacterial exposure, bacteria lysis, and single-cell RT-PCR-PMA – in 90 – 150 min.
The proposed molecular detection platform can provide timely and objective data to clinicians during acute care
of bacteremia, which can improve their ability to establish diagnosis and administer antibacterial treatments,
potentially improving clinical outcomes and curtailing the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria."

Increasing opioid use in the U.S. has led to a dramatic increase in opioid-related fatal and non-fatal overdoses
(OD), and adults with mental health disorders, including anxiety and mood disorders, are significantly more
likely to use nonprescription opioids. Mental health and associated drug use are directly and significantly
impacted by the neighborhood environment, but few studies have examined the impact of modifiable
neighborhood features on OD risk. The broad objective of this study is to investigate modifiable neighborhood
factors which impact mental health and which may contribute to opioid OD. The proposed research will achieve
the following interconnected specific aims using mixed quantitative/qualitative approaches with fatal OD data
from New York City, Chicago, and Seattle and original in-depth interviews with people who use drugs: (1)
investigate the associations between modifiable physical and social neighborhood factors and opioid OD; (2)
examine key mental health indicators as mediators of the relationship between modifiable neighborhood factors
and opioid OD; (3) comparatively investigate the associations between modifiable neighborhood factors, mental
health indicators, and opioid OD, comparing the locations where people who use opioids lived versus the
locations where they overdosed. In-depth interviews with people who use drugs will provide context for
quantitative results, identifying mechanisms by which neighborhood impacts drug using and associated OD risk
and informing novel strategies for OD prevention. This K01 mentored research scientist development proposal
will provide the training and expertise needed to transition to research independence in drug use research. Five
specific training areas will be incorporated to carry out these research goals: (1) obtain advanced skills in
structural equation modeling and Bayesian modeling methods, and causal inference theory and methods; (2)
develop expertise in mixed quantitative and qualitative methods research theory, design, and analysis, and build
capacity in collecting and analyzing qualitative data; (3) develop subject matter expertise in psychiatric
epidemiology and associated drug use risk factors, in particular, major depression, general anxiety disorders,
and diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders; (4) obtain additional training in the ethical conduct of research
among marginalized and stigmatized populations; (5) build professional skills for a successful research career as
an independent scientist leading multidisciplinary teams to build new knowledge and address major challenges
in drug use and abuse. These training goals will be achieved through a combination of didactic courses,
specialized workshops, hands-on research, and mentoring from an interdisciplinary team of experts. This
research and training will lead to a subsequent R01 proposal that formally tests implementation strategies and
effectiveness of neighborhood-level interventions for OD prevention."

Women living with HIV (WLWH) are at increased biologic risk for infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and
development of pre-invasive and invasive cervical cancer. The World Health Organization has recently called for
HIV-programs to bolster their efforts to prevent cervical cancer through integrated screening services.
Understanding and addressing stigma, including the intersection of HIV, HPV and cervical cancer-related stigma,
will be crucial to designing interventions that will facilitate the uptake of cancer screening among WLWH and
women in high HIV prevalence settings like western Kenya. Cancer-related stigma negatively influences several
determinants of cancer screening uptake, including perception of cancer risk, cancer screening benefit, and
acceptability of screening methods. In our prior work to evaluate HPV-based screening in Kenya, we found that
lack of education about cervical cancer and low awareness of screening benefits, both of which can potentiate
cancer-related stigma, were major barriers to screening uptake. Our team also found that misperceptions and
stigma about an HPV diagnosis and cancer were associated with reduced rates of follow-up among women who
tested positive for HPV. Our team developed a stigma framework to inform and validate a measurement tool for
HPV-, cervical cancer- and HIV-related stigmas. We found that educational messages focused on cancer-related
outcomes and HPV epidemiology, including risks related to sexual behavior and HIV, were stigmatizing, while
support from social networks and emphasis on the availability of effective treatment reduced stigma and
promoted screening uptake. We used this data to develop a stigma-responsive educational intervention which
includes simplified scripts for multiple cadres of health workers that provide clear messages about HPV and the
benefits of screening and a video aimed at addressing fears and misperceptions from a peer perspective. We
propose to incorporate these educational components into “Elimisha HPV,” a multilevel stigma-responsive
cervical cancer prevention service delivery model for integration within clinics providing HIV-care in western
Kenya. Elimisha HPV, which in Kiswahili means to increase understanding of HPV, will include the following
components: HPV-testing via self-collection, simplified scripts and video, peer navigators for women with
screening or treatment hesitancy, and the option to receive results and information via text messages. To adapt,
implement and test the effectiveness of this model, we will: 1) work with key stakeholders to finalize Elimisha
HPV 2) compare cervical cancer prevention outcomes and engagement in HIV care in clinics offering the
Elimisha HPV model to clinics providing standard of care outreach, education and screening strategies; and 3)
identify individual and institutional factors that moderate the effects of Elimisha HPV on cervical cancer
prevention outcomes. If effective, this may represent a new model for HPV-based cervical cancer screening as
well as a new paradigm for comprehensive, stigma-responsive service delivery packages for people living with
HIV."

10871793,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death worldwide affecting 1,000 cases every day in
the United States. Many of these individuals are Veterans given their high prevalence of coronary artery disease
and underlying risk factors. Despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), less than 10% are successfully resus-
citated and subsequently survive with good neurological function. Poor outcome is related to the damage that
tissues suffer, especially the heart and the brain, consequent to the lack of blood flow during cardiac arrest.
Additional tissue injury occurs when CPR is performed, and oxygenated blood is returned to organs that have
been deprived of oxygenated blood. This injury is known as reperfusion injury and, as of today, there is no
treatment available to reduce such injury during CPR. Our research lab for many years has shown that a group
of drugs able to reduce sodium entry into cardiac cells during CPR can significantly reduce reperfusion injury.
Yet, these drugs are not currently available for clinical use. However, a group of drugs known as gliflozins,
originally developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, can also exert favorable effects on the cardio-
vascular system. We conducted preliminary experiments in a swine model of cardiac arrest and found that em-
pagliflozin given during CPR protected the heart from such injury resulting in a better cardiac function after re-
suscitation. We now propose to conduct comprehensive studies in a swine model of cardiac arrest with high
translational value examining whether empagliflozin could elicit (as our preliminary experiments suggest) cardiac
effects during resuscitation of clinical value while understanding the mechanisms of these effects. The proposed
studies are divided into two specific aims. Under Specific Aim 1, experiments will examine the direct effects of
empagliflozin on the heart during cardiac resuscitation and after the return of cardiac activity. These studies will
determine whether empagliflozin can elicit effects similar to those of the aforementioned drugs that limit sodium
entry and will also examine the mechanisms by which empagliflozin elicits these effects. We will use an open-
chest swine model of ventricular fibrillation and resuscitation with extracorporeal circulation. Under Specific Aim
2, experiments will examine the effects on a closed-chest swine model of cardiac arrest applying the same
resuscitation protocols currently used for human resuscitation. We will examine the effects of empagliflozin on
clinically relevant outcomes including the rate of return of spontaneous circulation, survival at 72 hours, and the
recovery of neurological function. We will also examine the interaction of empagliflozin with vasopressor agents
given during CPR and whether empagliflozin could minimize detrimental post-resuscitation effects elicited by
epinephrine. In additional experiments, we will examine whether similar effects can be elicited by canagliflozin,
suggesting a gliflozin class effect, and determine whether delayed administration during CPR may compromise
the intended effect. If this project is successful, clinical translation of gliflozins for resuscitation will be greatly
facilitated given their clinical availability and the existing 505(b)(2) FDA pathway for repurposing drugs."

Recovery likelihood from substance use disorders (SUD) depends, in part, on the vulnerability magnitude for
relapse. A major driver of this vulnerability is the incentive motivational effect of stimuli, such as environmental
or situational context, paired with the rewarding substance of abuse. If the paired contextual memory is strong
and persistent during abstinence, the vulnerability for relapse can be great. Preclinical results suggest that this
paired motivational effect is tunable by certain brain neurons that produce the neurochemical serotonin. Our
recent work revealed that a specific subtype of brain serotonergic neuron, named genetically as r2Hoxa2-Pet1,
plays a central role in determining the persistence of contextually conditioned, cocaine-seeking behavior during
abstinence, likely through modulating the durability of encoded cocaine memories. We have begun delineating
the circuits modulated by r2Hoxa2-Pet1 neurons. We found that r2Hoxa2-Pet1 neurons project axon fibers to
the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and lateral septum intermediate – all brain structures implicated in
contextual memory and important to valence in cocaine addiction. We found that certain r2Hoxa2-Pet1
neurons deploy a presynaptic structure called a pericellular basket comprised of numerous synaptic boutons
ensheathing (basketing) the targeted neuron soma and proximal dendrites, suggesting privileged control over
the output of the basketed cell. r2Hoxa2-Pet1 pericellular baskets are found most densely in the lateral septum
intermediate (LSi). Work by others shows that the LSi contributes to reward reinforcement through
interconnections with the lateral hypothalamus and the mesolimbic dopamine system, is causally implicated in
the retrieval of relapse-inducing cocaine memories, and contains neurons that gate mobility contextually. We
refer to the LSi neurons basketed by r2Hoxa2-Pet1 boutons as LSi-r2P neurons. Our preliminary findings
suggest that LSi-r2P neurons are GABAergic but atypical in molecular expression, excitability, and firing
properties, suggesting they are a novel cell type(s) with unique functions. We speculate that this r2Hoxa2-Pet1
and LSi-r2P circuit influences (limits or coordinates) engrams (neural representations of memory traces)
encoding cocaine-use context and that this determines the strength and durability of cocaine-seeking behavior
during abstinence and thus may influence vulnerability magnitude for relapse. In this exploratory, foundational
R21 grant, we will, in Aim 1, delineate the intrinsic properties of the LSi-r2P neurons (excitability, firing
properties, morphology, transcriptome, and output targets) and, in Aim 2, characterize the transmission
interactions from r2Hoxa2-Pet1 baskets to LSi-r2P neurons. Revealed will be circuits, cells, and signaling
pathways which may underlie the propensity for context-triggered drug-seeking behavior. This work may have
substantial translational value because our pilot findings suggest that r2Hoxa2-Pet1 neurons also exist in the
human brain."

The overall objectives for this application are to determine the role of cholesterol metabolic
enzyme CYP46A1 and its metabolite 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-HC) in ischemic stroke. Our
central hypothesis is that activation of CYP46A1 results in increased production of 24S-HC,
which contributes to ischemic brain injury through potentiation of NMDAR. To test our
hypothesis, we will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo stroke models along with
electrophysiology, calcium imaging and transgenic mice to pursue the following three specific
aims: Aim 1. Determine the role of CYP46A1 in ischemic brain injury; Aim 2. Determine the role
and molecular mechanism of 24S-HC in ischemic neuronal injury in vitro; Aim 3. Define the
signaling cascade underlying the role of CYP46A1 in ischemic brain injury. Success of the
proposed research will define the role of cholesterol metabolic enzyme CYP46A1 and its
metabolite 24S-HC in ischemic brain injury."
10872232,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Telomerase has attracted significant attention as a potential target for understanding the aging process and for
the treatment of cancer, since telomeres and telomerase have important roles in the transformation and
survival of cancer cells. Previous prevailing strategies for targeting telomerase were based on the assumption
that in cancer cells, telomere-length maintenance was the sole pro-survival function of this assembly. However,
increasingly evidence strongly indicates that a) inhibition of the telomere-lengthening activity of telomerase is
not a magic bullet treatment for cancer, and b) there is a much larger role for telomerase in key cellular
pathways and these functions are not well understood. Although there have been promising clinical candidates
among telomerase inhibitors, the translation of telomerase-targeted therapies to the clinic remains elusive and
frustratingly slow. This lack of progress is due in part to the growing list of unanswered questions surrounding
telomerase and its role in cancer biology; notably, that hTERT has non-canonical functions separate from
its telomere-lengthening activity that are linked to cancer cell survival. This proposal builds on the
collaboration between the Scheidt and Kron research groups to bring our expertise in chemical synthesis and
cancer biology to bear on key gaps in the knowledge surrounding hTERT, its non-canonical functions, and its
involvement in cancer cell survival. We have discovered that small molecules based on the natural product
chrolactomycin inhibit telomerase and provide a unique platform for probe development. Based on robust
chemical and biological results, we propose to first develop enhanced small molecule probes with improved
efficacy. These compounds will enable precise covalent modification of hTERT catalytic function without
perturbing the overall complex assembly. The following Aims will focus on exploring the use of these new tools
to explore the role(s) of telomerase in DNA damage repair and cell senescence through in-depth analysis of
multiple functions of telomerase as a buffer of cell stress and determinant of cell immortality. The long-term
goal of this project is to understand and leverage the molecular basis for how these natural product-based
molecular tools impact the telomere lengthening and most importantly, non-canonical functions of hTERT.
Ultimately, this new knowledge will drive the development of new understanding of telomerase and its
biological roles."
10869690,"Each year, approximately 10 million senior Americans suffer from postoperative delirium, a
sudden brain failure that manifests after anesthesia and surgery and is characterized by memory
loss, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered consciousness. The risk of developing
delirium can be as high as 80% among patients aged 65 and older who require sedation and
breathing support in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) after major surgery. Postoperative delirium is
strongly associated with many adverse outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays, greater
morbidity and mortality rates, and an increased risk of long-term cognitive decline and dementia.
Unfortunately, there is currently no FDA-approved medication for treating delirium. Previous
studies have focused on neuroinflammation, microglia activation, and a compromised blood-brain
barrier as potential cause of delirium. However, interventions targeting these factors have failed
to translate into successful clinical treatments. Perineuronal nets (PNN) are a promising area of
investigation for developing new approaches against postoperative delirium. These extracellular
matrix structures form a protective shield around specialized neurons known as parvalbumin-
positive interneurons. These neurons play a crucial role in supporting cognitive functions that are
impaired during delirium, including memory, attention, decision-making, and thought organization.
This proposal aims to test the central hypothesis that the development of delirium-like cognitive
impairment is linked to PNN remodeling in aged mice exposed to anesthesia, surgery and ICU-
like conditions. In Aim #1, we will investigate whether a decrease in the number of parvalbumin-
positive neurons enmeshed with PNN and increased levels of chondroitin sulfate isomers C and
E within hippocampal PNN coincide with delirium-like cognitive impairment in aged mice
subjected to anesthesia, surgery and ICU-like conditions. In Aim #2, we will test the idea that
young mice exposed to anesthesia, surgery, and a simulated ICU environment do not experience
changes in the quantity and composition of their PNN, and consequently, do not develop delirium-
like behaviors. Impact: If our hypothesis proves true and the development of delirium-like
cognitive impairment is indeed linked to PNN remodeling following anesthesia, surgery, and ICU
conditions, this discovery would revolutionize our current understanding of the neurobiology of
delirium. It could also open unprecedented opportunities to target PNN as a novel therapeutic
approach against this condition that currently lacks effective pharmacological treatment options."

Advance care planning (ACP) is the process that allows individuals to express their future health care values
and preferences, so that these wishes can be enacted in the event that they become incapacitated and unable
to participate in their own health care decisions. In the case of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias
(ADRD), the person with dementia (care recipient), almost inevitably loses decisional capacity toward the end
of life, given the progressive decline in cognitive functioning that accompanies the disease over time. The care
partners to persons with dementia, most often family members such as spouse/partners and adult children, are
therefore tasked with making end-of-life decisions on behalf of the care recipient with ADRD. These care
partners are not always well-informed of the care recipient’s end-of-life values and preferences, and therefore
may not feel confident in their ability to make decisions regarding care and treatment at the end of life, resulting
in unnecessary, futile, and often unwanted medical treatments and interventions. Oftentimes, families do not
want to engage in these challenging conversations and wait too long, whereby the care recipient with ADRD no
longer has decisional ability to participate in the advance care planning process. We developed “The LEAD
Guide” (Life-Planning in Early Alzheimer’s and Dementia), as a tool to help persons with preclinical awareness
of ADRD risk and those with early-stage cognitive impairment to begin these important conversations with a
care partner. With funding from the National Alzheimer’s Association, we have created a preliminary interactive
LEAD Intervention that combines the LEAD Guide with educational materials about the importance of having
conversations about, documenting (advance directive), and sharing ACP wishes with other family members
and health care providers. This proposal outlines a mixed-method research study where we aim to: 1) evaluate
the usability, accepability, feasability, and initial efficacy of the LEAD Intervention as a self-administered,
dementia-focused web-based tool that can be used to facilitate the ACP process for 60 diverse community-
dwelling pairs consisting of persons in the preclinical or early stage of ADRD and their care partner, 2) assess
the initial efficacy of the LEAD Intervention on decision-making confidence, relationship quality, subjective well-
being, and anxiety in both the care recipient and care partner, and 3) examine if the process of ACP
congruence (shared understanding of the care recipients’ values and preferences regarding EOL care) as the
primary factor related to changes observed during the LEAD intervention. Results from this study have the
potential to guide and accelerate the implementation of the LEAD Intervention to community and health care
practice, where a dementia-focused ACP process is needed."
10873033,"Infections due to N. gonorrhoeae are a major cause of morbidity with an estimated 850,000 cases in the
U.S. and 87 million cases worldwide annually. Within the VA Health Care System, cases of gonorrhea
increased between 2013 and 2017 with the total number in that time period at 10,587. The most serious
sequelae are suffered by infected women as gonococci ascend to the upper reproductive tract and cause
pelvic inflammatory disease in 10-20% of women with infections, which encompasses a wide range of
inflammatory conditions and often leads to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. There is no
vaccine to N. gonorrhoeae and a great need for new antibiotics due to the alarming rise in multidrug-resistance
(MDR), which is making emergence of untreatable gonococcal infections a real prospect. Currently only
ceftriaxone and azithromycin are recommended for first-line therapy, and clinical isolates resistant to both of
those antibiotics have been reported in countries including Denmark, Canada, and Japan. Thus, there is a
compelling need for new antimicrobials for gonococcal infections.
 Our studies to date of N. gonorrhoeae lipooligosaccharide (LOS) and the human innate immune system
have shown that the lipid A portion of LOS is the primary inducer of cytokine-mediated inflammation and
investigations by others have shown that the lipid A also facilitates gonococcal infection. These data led us to
the concept that targeting lipid A biosynthesis would be an effective approach to combating N. gonorrhoeae
infections. We recently reported that inhibition of LpxC, the enzyme that catalyzes the second step of lipid A
biosynthesis, was bactericidal for nine multidrug-resistant and human challenge strains of gonococci and
reduced cytokine induction without apparent human cell cytotoxicity.
 From the LpxC inhibitor data, we postulated that membrane disruption due to the inhibition of LOS
biosynthesis was lethal for gonococci. To investigate this, we recently evaluated the bactericidal potential of a
12 amino acid cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) for MDR and human challenge strains of N. gonorrhoeae and
found that the CPP penetrated the bacterial membrane and was bactericidal for all nine MDR and human
challenge strains of gonococci tested. Importantly, no apparent resistance to the CPP developed in surviving
bacteria as susceptibility was the same in bacteria from colonies after exposure to CPP and then retreated.
Further, the CPP reduced inflammatory cytokine induction and prevented bacterial cell invasion of cervical
epithelial cells in the absence of measurable cell cytotoxicity.
 These novel data highlight LpxC and CPP as promising antimicrobials for N. gonorrhoeae and strongly
support the hypothesis of this application that inhibiting the biosynthesis of lipid A components with LpxC
inhibitors and disrupting outer membrane integrity with CPP will impact bacterial viability and host response to
N. gonorrhoeae infection in vitro and in vivo, which will have a therapeutic impact on infection outcomes.
 This project is focused on optimizing and testing the efficacy of the CPP and LpxC inhibitor in relevant in
vitro assays of bactericidal activity, cytokine induction, hemolysis, and cell cytotoxicity. Mechanistic studies will
include investigations of DNA binding, cell permeabilization, proteolysis resistance, protein binding and the
effect of the MtrCDE, MacAB and NorM gonococcal efflux pumps. The lead candidate CPP and LpxC inhibitor
identified in vitro will be tested for in vivo efficacy, pharmacokinetics and cardiovascular toxicity in an
established female mouse model of gonococcal genital tract infection that has been increasingly used for
evaluation of candidate antimicrobials for treatment of gonorrhea.
 We expect that the results from our studies will demonstrate the efficacy of these two antimicrobials as new
therapeutics for N. gonorrhoeae infection, which are urgently needed given the rise in MDR gonococcal strains.
This will be the first study of its kind to test these two classes of antimicrobials for efficacy against gonorrhea."

Sensorineural hearing loss is caused by the death of hair cells in the organ of Corti, and once lost, cochlear
hair cells in humans and other mammals do not regenerate. In contrast, non-mammalian vertebrates can
functionally recover from deafening injury by mobilizing supporting cells to divide and differentiate to replace
lost hair cells. Over the last 10 years, the consensus from many studies is that supporting cells in the
embryonic and neonatal organ of Corti retain a limited capacity to divide and differentiate into hair cells under
certain conditions, but that this ability declines precipitously prior to the onset of hearing.
One facet of such an age-dependent decline in regenerative potential is the function of the transcription factor
Atoh1. Ectopic expression of Atoh1 in embryonic or neonatal cochlear tissue can transform supporting cells or
adjacent non-sensory cells into hair cells - but this ability appears to be severely diminished after the onset of
hearing in mice. We have shown that additional hair cell transcription factors, such as Gfi1 and Pou4f3, can
enhance the ability of Atoh1 to generate hair cell-like cells in older animals, but it is not clear how closely these
resemble bona fide hair cells, whether reprogramming is feasible in ears that have been chronically deafened,
and whether additional interventions can improve the modest regeneration we observe. This proposal seeks to
evaluate the feasibility of transcription factor reprogramming in the mature, deafened cochlea. We will also
apply these cochlear regenerative strategies to the mature utricle, which we and others have shown to have a
greater capacity for regeneration than the cochlea, and also a better response to transcription factor
reprogramming."

Obesity is a major global public health concern. Worldwide, 39% of the population is overweight and 13% of the
population is obese. Obesity contributes to many other diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, some cancers,
and notably, type 2 diabetes (T2D). Currently, 425 million people globally have been diagnosed with T2D and
this number is expected to grow to over 600 million people by 2050. Although T2D itself is a non-communicable
disease, many patients with diabetes are more susceptible to microbial infections and exhibit a higher burden of
disease. Although obese animals have an increased production of myeloid cells, previous work from our labs
has shown that a failure to heal diabetic wounds corresponds to elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in
the inflammatory macrophages that are recruited to the wound. Furthermore, past studies from our lab have
demonstrated that PGE2 signaling can impair the innate immune functions of macrophages. Therefore, we
hypothesized that diabetic obese mice would be more susceptible to a respiratory Pseudomonas aeruginosa
strain PA01 infection due to impaired function of lung resident and recruited macrophages. Preliminary studies
demonstrate that obese diabetic mice do have an increased P. aeruginosa burden in the lung 24 hours after
infection. Additionally, we have determined that naïve obese diabetic mice have an increase in lung neutrophils
compared to lean mice, however, after infection with P. aeruginosa, these mice have a decrease in neutrophils
compared to lean mice. This suggests that obese mice have a defect in neutrophil recruitment during infection.
Additionally, neutrophil function assays show that neutrophils from obese diabetic mice have a defect in killing
P. aeruginosa. These observations drive this proposal which will test the hypothesis that obese diabetic mice
have not only a defect in innate immune cell recruitment, but also a defect in innate immune cell function during
bacterial pneumonia. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims: Aim 1) determine the functional
defects in alveolar macrophages during P. aeruginosa infection and Aim 2) determine the bacterial clearance
and recruitment defects in neutrophils during P. aeruginosa infection. Throughout these aims, we explore sex
as a biological variable, as males have enhanced obesity-induced inflammation compared to females.
Experiments for these aims will be completed with the use of a murine diet induced obesity model, cells derived
from these mice, and human cells derived from discarded blood samples from patients with and without T2D.
The results from these innovative studies may inform treatments to improve outcomes from bacterial pneumonia
in patients with T2D. Completion of this proposal will also allow for the applicant to receive rigorous training in
experimental design, implementation, and interpretation that will help her become a successful, independent
scientist."

with extensive resources and opportunities for scientific interaction, including a wide range of available
coursework and multiple ongoing seminar series in neuroscience, neurology, and epilepsy. This application is
supported enthusiastically by the Department of Neurology at Penn.
Research: My preliminary experiments in Dr. Goldberg’s laboratory have identified a profound hyperexcitability
in the cortico-hippocampal circuit within a mouse model of genetic epilepsy (Scn1a+/-), suggesting a circuit-level
convergence with mouse models of acquired temporal lobe epilepsy. The proposed research will identify the
microcircuitry underlying this finding, and will test the hypothesis that this circuit is critical for the generation of
seizures in the temporal lobe. These outcomes will provide novel insights into mechanisms of this important
genetic epilepsy, as well as establishing more broadly a circuit-level pathogenesis underlying temporal lobe-
onset seizures. This mentored career development award will position me to translate the insights gleaned from
basic neuroscience research to inform and motivate future attempts at the targeted treatment of epilepsy."

 The Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology (GI) of the Department of Medicine, in collaboration with
Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB) and the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics
(LDI), submits this application to continue an innovative and successful post-doctoral training program for clinical
investigators in gastrointestinal clinical research. The University of Pennsylvania (Penn) Perelman School of
Medicine promotes an academic environment in which research is encouraged and flourishes as a career paths
This high impact training program attracts trainees nationwide and its graduates move into institutions nationwide.
 The objectives of the research training program are to 1) train clinicians to be rigorous and independent
academic investigators able to use a broad array of clinical research methods to address research issues in
gastroenterology related to the etiology, prognosis, prevention, early detection, treatment, clinical economics,
technology assessment, medical decision making, and quality of patient care; 2) provide closely mentored
research experiences with faculty preceptors with expertise in clinical research and gastroenterology; and 3)
strengthen the links between clinical research and gastroenterology.
 The rationale for the design of the training program stems from the tremendous need for physician-scientists
with expertise in clinical research methodology to advance the field of gastroenterology and recognition that
formal research training is necessary to develop leaders in clinical research. The design of the training program
includes: 1) required courses in clinical epidemiology, health services research, biostatistics, implementation
science, grant writing and gastroenterology epidemiology; 2) elective courses relevant to the trainees’
methodologic interests; 3) a research apprenticeship; 4) journal clubs and conferences focusing on research
issues in gastroenterology; 5) independent readings; 6) a professional and career development seminar series;
and 7) instruction in the responsible conduct of research. These formal didactics have been constructed to prepare
trainees to design and complete a mentored but trainee led research project.
 The program: 1) Four fellowship slots are awarded each year. Trainees will matriculate in either the Master of
Science in Clinical Epidemiology (MSCE) or Master of Science in Health Policy Research (MSHP) or Master of
Health Care Innovation (MHCI) degree program. Trainees will remain in the program for two years.
 Strengths of the proposed program are: 1) the long history of successful research training programs in the GI
Division, CCEB, and LDI; 2) the collaborative links that already have been forged among the three programs; 3)
the comprehensive course offerings and ongoing research programs available to trainees; 4) the successful
training records of the program directors and faculty, and 5) the track record of the program to produce
independent clinical investigators conducting grant-funded clinical research in gastroenterology."
10867437,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cachexia has a devastating impact on survival and quality of life of many cancer patients and remains an unmet
medical need. Pancreatic cancer patients present with the highest incidence of cachexia (~90%), and
approximately one-third of these patients lose more than 10% of their pre-illness weight, leading to general
muscle weakness, impairment of normal activities, and eventually death through respiratory failure. A deeper
understanding of the underlying mechanisms that lead to the complex metabolic defects of cachexia, coupled
with effective treatment options, would improve management of muscle wasting in cancer patients.
 We have recently reported that ectopic expression of the transcription factor Twist1 in muscle progenitor
cells is sufficient to cause severe muscle atrophy akin to muscle cachexia. Using several genetic mouse models
of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we detected high Twist1 expression in muscle undergoing cancer
cachexia. Of particular importance, inactivating muscle Twist1, either genetically or pharmacological, was
sufficient to reverse muscle cachexia and improve survival in several genetic mouse models of cancer cachexia,
implicating Twist1 as a possible target for attenuating muscle cachexia in cancer patients.
 Quite serendipitously, we found that muscle Twist1 was highly crosslinked during cancer cachexia. We
obtained strong evidence that this process was mediated by the crosslinking enzyme Transglutaminase 2
(TGM2). Treatment of cells with a specific TGM2 inhibitor completely suppressed Twist1-induced expression of
MuRF1 and Atrogin1, two ubiquitin ligases that drive muscle protein degradation during muscle cachexia. Other
preliminary data showed that expression of Twist1 in vivo promotes muscle TGM2 expression. More crucially,
we detected a marked increase in both muscle Twist1 and TGM2 expression in cachectic cancer patients as
compared to healthy individuals, attesting to the clinical relevance of our findings.
 Based on these intriguing findings, we hypothesize that TGM2 might function in partnership with Twist1
to orchestrate a feed-forward network that initiates and sustains muscle cachexia during cancer progression. We
also hypothesize that developing combinatorial therapeutic strategies targeting both TGM2 and Twist1 could
mitigate potential drug toxicity by lowering the dose needed for each medicine and combat the development of
resistance. These overarching hypotheses will be tested in our research proposal.
Specific Aim 1: Investigate the relationship between TGM2 and Twist1 during muscle cachexia
Specific Aim 2: Explore the role of the TGM2-Twist1 axis in muscle cachexia using genetic approaches
Specific Aim 3: Test the therapeutic value of targeting both TGM2 and Twist1 in muscle cachexia
We believe that our innovative proposal to exploit this novel TGM2/Twist1 axis in muscle cachexia will culminate
in a paradigm shift in our understanding and therapeutic treatment of this lethal wasting syndrome."
10867438,"Summary: Cell migration is a fundamental cellular phenomenon that plays a pivotal role in (patho)physiological
events, including organ development, tissue regeneration and cancer metastasis. Our long-term goal is to
achieve a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of cell migration in order to develop novel
therapeutic tools and strategies to prevent the initiation and progression of diseases, including cardiovascular
pathologies, aging, and cancer. Building on the PI's postdoctoral work, the lab explores how the physical cues
of the local microenvironment (e.g., confinement, viscoelasticity, stiffness, pressure and shear stress) convert
into biochemical signals to influence the migratory behavior of cells. Over the next five years, we will employ
state-of-the-art microfabricated devices, materials, optogenetic tools, single-cell transcriptomics and
computational simulations to elucidate the effects of pressure forces on cell migration and viability. The scientific
premise of this application is based on prior studies showing that cells experience elevated pressure forces
during various stages of migration and invasion, including extra/intravasation and interstitial migration. Although
the widely held view is that cells can adapt to mechanical cues, an open and unaddressed question is how
elevated pressure affects cell behavior in diverse, yet physiologically relevant, microenvironments. To answer
this question, we will investigate the interplay between pressure forces and different microenvironmental cues
(physical or biochemical) in the regulation of cell migration. We will also assess whether long-term cell exposure
to high pressures alters the sensitivity of cell motility to physical cues. Last but not least, we will dissect the
relative roles and potential crosstalk between confinement and pressure in cell death regulation. Taken together,
the proposed studies, which are supported by highly encouraging preliminary results, will delineate the
underlying mechanisms regulating cell behavior in physiological environments and generate novel conceptual
information that will facilitate the identification of new therapeutic targets aimed at promoting or preventing cell
motility in vivo."
10867531,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) represent major
milestones in the effort to eliminate AIDS and prevent new HIV-1 infections. They nonetheless have
limitations. For example, a life-time use of two or three compounds delivered to most every cell and
tissue in the body will likely come with undesirable, difficult-to-anticipate side effects. Access and
compliance also remain concerns, especially among infected persons who have not yet been reached
by our healthcare infrastructures. Similarly, PrEP requires both access and a conscious effort before a
potential transmission event, something that is not always realistic for the hardest-to-reach
demographics here and abroad. Here we will develop an approach that provides robust prophylaxis and
perhaps effective viral suppression for six months or more after a single injection. Specifically we will
optimize eCD4-Ig, a very broad and potent antibody-like molecule, for its delivery in an injectable
hydrogel, and we will optimize this hydrogel for delivery of eCD4-Ig. eCD4-Ig provides highly effective
protection in rhesus macaques from high-dose challenges with both SHIV-AD8 and SIVmac239. It also
has the breadth and potency to suppress an established SHIV-AD8 infection. This breadth appears
sufficient to suppress the wide diversity of viruses in an individual and in a population. As importantly,
HIV-1 has not developed easily accessible pathways of escape from eCD4-Ig as it has from neutralizing
antibodies. It is therefore an ideal payload for a safe, effective, and sustained hydrogel delivery system.
As we show, these hydrogels are well-tolerated, non-immunogenic, easily manufactured, and
deliverable with a high-gauge need. Importantly, they and their payloads can be immediately withdrawn
in case of an adverse event. Modeling suggest that they can sustain eCD4-Ig concentrations that could
provide effective prophylaxis for well over six months. We will test this possibility in human FcRn-
transgenic mice and in rhesus macaques, and confirm that our best eCD4-Ig/hydrogel formulations could
replace PrEP and/or cART."
10868085,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Untargeted metabolomics using tandem mass spectrometry (MS) have attained substantial success in the
discovery of biomarkers and advancing our understanding of cellular metabolism. Despite this success, only a
small fraction of measured spectra can currently be annotated (assigned a chemical identity). This bottleneck
can be attributed to the limitations of current annotation tools that have not yet exploited advances in deep
learning and available data modalities (spectra, peaks, molecules, and fragments). The goal of this application
is to advance the interpretation of spectra collected through untargeted metabolomics. We focus on annotating
data collected through liquid or gas chromatology followed by MS, or MS/MS, as these three tandem
technologies have become dominant technologies. Over the next five years, the plan is to harness deep learning
to address three problems: 1) annotation, 2) translation between spectra measured under different instrument
settings, and 3) explainable models for annotation, where explainability arises from connecting peaks to their
respective molecular fragments.
 The Hassoun lab has extensive, relevant deep learning experience to effectively tackle these problems.
The Lab also has experience in dealing with the nuances of metabolomics datasets. The Lab recently developed
a novel deep learning annotation model that achieves 41% and 30% performance improvement over multi-layer
neural networks and graph neural networks, respectively. Additionally, our lab has developed an ontology-
traversal algorithm that yields correct-by-construction molecular substructures that can be assigned to peaks,
thus giving rise to datasets that can be used to train explainable annotation models.
 The Significance of this research is that it addresses fundamental barriers that hinder developing deep
learning annotation models. Our models and datasets will be released on GitHub to benefit biological and
biomedical applications and metabolomics research. Because of their expected high accuracy and explainability,
the models will expedite the interpretation of experiments, improve our understanding of cellular metabolism,
and facilitate data sharing among labs. The innovation lies in maximally learn from data modalities and in
creating models that exploit the learned representations. Further, the annotation and translation problems are
formulated as a bidirectional mapping between domains, in contrast to current annotation models that assume
unimodal mappings. These innovations are necessary to advance metabolomics research and they will open
new research horizons in the field of metabolomics."
10865969,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The hippocampus is critical for episodic memory – the ability to record information about a single experience and
flexibly use this information to guide future action. The hippocampus is also implicated in spatial memory and
navigation, which are thought to depend on place cells. These functions are intertwined in natural behavior, as
an organism recalls individual memories to guide its navigational decisions. However, the physiological
mechanisms underlying the recollection of individual experiences remain unclear. It is furthermore unknown how
episodic recall influences the action-selection circuits which implement navigational decisions, as well as the role
of place cells in this process. I will use the food-caching behavior of black-capped chickadees as a model system
to address these questions. Chickadees are known to form single-shot, hippocampal-dependent cache
memories which they use to subsequently retrieve cached food items. I will identify neural signatures of episodic
memory recall in hippocampal activity, and develop a computational model of the mechanisms involved (Aim 1;
K99). To determine the mechanisms mediating memory’s interactions with decision making, I will characterize
neural tuning in areas downstream to the hippocampus which play a role in action selection, including the lateral
septum and nucleus accumbens (Aim 2; R00). The chickadee hippocampus exhibits many functional and
anatomical homologies with mammalian hippocampus, so results will reveal fundamental mechanisms broadly
shared across vertebrates. Episodic memory and hippocampal function contribute significantly to human quality
of life, and are disrupted by conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, so results will assist future technology
development to improve and preserve memory abilities in health and disease. Candidate and Career Goals: I
intend to obtain a tenure-track faculty position where I will establish an independent research lab. I will study
episodic memory and decision making using food-caching birds, with a focus on interactions between
hippocampal and subcortical brain areas. Career Development Plan: I will be trained by primary mentor Dr.
Dmitriy Aronov to develop novel behavioral paradigms and electrophysiological techniques in food-caching birds.
My co-mentor Dr. Larry Abbott will train me in developing computational circuit models of hippocampal function.
I will also receive training from co-mentor Dr. Jesse Goldberg in preparation for studying subcortical areas
involved in motor control and their interactions with hippocampus. In combination with the support of research
and professional development opportunities at Columbia University, this training will make me a highly
competitive candidate for research positions."
10865837,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
This proposed career development award will provide Dr. Danielle Alfano, MD with targeted mentored training to
ensure she develops into an independent researcher utilizing both experimental approaches, mouse models,
and “omics”, to probe how specific pathogens harness ADAM10 leading to the dysregulated endothelial and host
response in sepsis. Sepsis is a complex syndrome defined as a ‘dysregulated host response to infection leading
to life-threatening organ dysfunction’. While many studies in the field have focused on an aberrant host immune
response as the instigator of severe sepsis, all efforts have failed to translate this into new therapies. The
endothelium plays a critical role in the host response to infection and organ injury. We have recently
demonstrated that ADAM10, the eukaryotic receptor for S. aureus α-toxin, acts a molecular specifier of sepsis,
mediating mortality and endothelial injury to a diverse subset of pathogens. However, the precise molecular
mechanisms remain poorly understood. The proposed research plan aims to close key knowledge gaps
regarding how specific pathogens harness ADAM10 in disease and the molecular mechanisms of endothelial
injury. To do so, the PI will leverage multiple live pathogens and unique mouse lines to fully characterize the
nature of ADAM10 functions that contribute to sepsis progression. The PI aims to 1) understand the molecular
mechanisms by which diverse pathogens activate endothelial ADAM10, 2) characterize ADAM10 specific
substrates released during systemic infection, and 3) examine how an ADAM10 SNP polymorphism may confer
increased risk of lethal disease. The proposed 5-year career development and training plan incorporates
strategically designed didactic learning, mentored practical training, and career advising to complement the PI’s
expertise in ways that are critical to completion of her research and career goals. The specific career
development goals outlined in this application include developing mechanistic expertise in 1) vascular biology
and intracellular signaling pathways; 2) host-pathogen interactions; and 3) proteomics. She will be training at
WUSM, a world- class center for basic and translational research and an excellent environment for physician-
scientist training with experts in all aspects of the proposed training. She will be closely mentored by Dr. Juliane
Bubeck Wardenburg, an expert in S. aureus, ADAM10, host-pathogen interactions, and immunology. The long-
term goal is to provide Dr. Alfano with the skills required to become an independent, R01- funded faculty member
working to study pathogen-specific molecular determinants of sepsis and factors that confer increased risk of
life-threatening sepsis to certain populations to provide novel insights into future therapeutic developments."
10865838,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive form of breast cancer that lacks targeted therapies.
Individuals with Breast Cancer 1 (BRCA1) gene mutations have a significantly higher risk of developing TNBC
in their lifetimes compared to the rest of the population. TNBC disproportionately affects young Black women
and the mortality rate from TNBC is significantly higher among Black women. Although TNBC incidence is
higher in Black women compared to other groups, the incidence of germline BRCA1 mutations is significantly
lower in Black women, highlighting the need to pinpoint additional factors responsible for TNBC disparities.
Residential segregation created and perpetuated by discriminatory housing practices has led to predominantly
Black communities being located in close proximity to industrial sites, including Superfund sites, that are
commonly contaminated with heavy metals including cadmium (Cd). Cd is a heavy metal group 1 carcinogen
that has a long biological half-life in the human body. Epidemiological studies demonstrate that Cd exposure
increases breast cancer risk and in vitro studies determined that Cd exposure promotes TNBC initiation in
normal human breast cells. Cd is known to displace zinc (Zn) from Zn coordinating proteins and several Zn
coordinating proteins are important for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair including RAD50 and BRCA1.
Cd promotes higher levels of DSBs and sister chromatid exchanges indicative of DSB repair pathway
inhibition. Whether Cd promotes TNBC initiation and progression by disruption of DSB signaling and repair,
including direct inhibition of RAD50 or BRCA1, remains to be established. I hypothesize that Cd exposure
promotes TNBC initiation and progression by disruption of multilateral DSB signaling and repair. The
experiments proposed to test this hypothesis will be conducted in two phases. During the mentored K99
phase, mass spectrometry, single-molecule imaging using isolated recombinant proteins and DNA curtain
assays, and CRISPR-based editing will be employed to determine how Cd directly targets DSB repair proteins
to disrupt DSB Repair pathway “choice”. While in the mentored phase, the candidate will take advantage of
career development resources made available by the University of Louisville Center for Integrative
Environmental Health Sciences and will apply research and career development skills to didactic lecturing,
mentoring, writing, and presentation opportunities. In the non-mentored R00 phase of the project, technical
skills gained from the K99 phase will be used for mechanistic studies to interrogate the role of Cd-induced
fusion genes in TNBC development (Aim 2). These experiments will provide data needed for initial
independent publications and preliminary data for R-series grants, and will establish an independent direction
for the candidate from her mentor."
10865916,"Project Summary
 Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a devastating lung disease characterized by pulmonary vascular
remodeling and associated with high morbidity and mortality. Discovery of new therapeutic targets in PH has
been limited by the heterogeneity in disease endotypes and incomplete mechanistic insight into the cellular
processes that control and perpetuate vascular remodeling. Recently, the mechanistic target of rapamycin
(mTOR) signaling pathway has been implicated in the development and progression of PH, including pulmonary
arterial hypertension (PAH). Despite the growing importance of mTOR activation in pulmonary diseases, the
effects of mTOR hyperactivation on pulmonary cells and the contribution of mTOR to the development and
progression of vascular remodeling remains incompletely understood.
 In my preliminary data, I demonstrate that mesenchymal cells will act as a signaling hub after selective
deletion of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) and subsequent mTOR activation in progenitor mesenchymal
cells (Tbx4LME-CreTsc2Mesenchymal KO). These cells orchestrate dysregulated cellular responses in arterial endothelial
cells (ECs), leading to pulmonary vascular remodeling and spontaneous PH in Tsc2M-KO mice. This proposal will
expand on this finding and examine how mTOR activation in specific mesenchymal populations alters EC
behavior, function and trajectory and how aberrant mTOR signaling contributes to pulmonary vascular
remodeling. To accomplish this task, I will utilize three novel mouse models with mTOR activation in distinct
mesenchymal populations. To understand the disease relevance of the murine models, I will be performing
concurrent experiments on primary lung tissues from lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and PAH. LAM is a
monogenic disease with mTORC1 activation in lung mesenchyme cells. In additional to parenchymal changes,
a subset of patients with LAM develop pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH. As a monogenic disease, LAM
is an ideal model for the study of mTOR activation on EC biology and pulmonary vascular remodeling.
 This proposal leverage my expertise in pulmonary vascular biology, ex vivo model systems and in vivo
experience with transgenic murine lines to generate significant discoveries regarding the fate regulation and
function of endothelial cells in pulmonary vascular remodeling. My training, composed of coursework/workshops
in bioinformatics and epigenetics, will take place under the mentorship of Dr. Vera Krymskaya, a leader in mTOR
research. To ensure that I am meeting research and academic milestones, I have compiled a diverse but
complementary Advisory Committee. Upon completion of this work, I will develop additional comprehensive skills
in epigenetic analysis and advanced bioinformatics, ex vivo lung modeling, and in vivo murine models. Together,
the research and career development plans proposed herein will facilitate a better understanding of the cellular
crosstalk in the pulmonary microenvironment while preparing me for my future career as an independent
investigator in the field of vascular biology."
10868747,"Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children and the leading infectious cause of
death in the U.S, costing more than $17 billion. Antibiotic resistance (AR) increasingly
complicates pneumonia treatment and poses a national and worldwide public health crisis.
Klebsiella pneumoniae, a common pneumonia-causing AR pathogen, is an excellent tool for
preclinical modeling of pulmonary immunity. While immune modulation therapies have
transformed the fields of cancer and autoimmunity, immunotherapy is undeveloped for the
treatment of bacterial infections including pneumonia.
 We identified that follistatin-like 1 (FSTL-1) as is a novel host-immune gene critical for
pulmonary host defense. The FSTL-1 mediated effect required expression of nuclear hormone
receptor 4A1 (Nr4a1), a newly recognized determinant of K. pneumoniae (Kp) pulmonary
immunity. However, the mechanism underlying FSTL-1- and Nr4a1-mediated lung host defense
are unknown. Published literature and our preliminary data lead to the hypothesis that FSTL-
1, through CD14-binding, promotes pulmonary innate immunity against K. pneumoniae
by 1) directing neutrophil recruitment to the lung and 2) enhancing neutrophil-intrinsic,
Nr4a1-dependent bacterial killing, which will be tested via three Aims.
 Aim 1) will elucidate the constituents of FSTL-1 mediated neutrophil recruitment to the
lung during K. pneumoniae infection using the Kp pneumonia model, will test whether FSTL-
1 -dependent neutrophil recruitment is immune cell-intrinsic, whether rFSTL-1-driven neutrophil
recruitment is mediated by the receptor CD14 and the cellular requirements therein, as well as
the cell-specific contribution of Nr4a1 in FSTL-1-mediated pulmonary immunity. Aim 2) will
determine how FSTL-1 enhances neutrophil-intrinsic bactericidal function by testing
whether neutrophil-intrinsic FSTL-1 expression is required antibacterial effector function, FSTL-
1-dependent neutrophil effector function (phagocytosis, oxidative burst/ROS production,
NETosis and the requirement of CD14 on neutrophils for this effect. Aim 3) will define the
therapeutic potential of targeting Nr4a1 during K. pneumoniae infection. This will examine
if Nr4a1-deficiency impairs neutrophil effector functions and whether Nr4a1 stimulating
treatment can be used to improve bacterial pneumonia.
 Cumulatively, the proposed work will focus on filling an existing gap in knowledge: the
cellular and molecular constituents of FSTL-1-mediated pulmonary host-defense."
10868754,"U.S. children are increasingly from non-majority racial/ethnic backgrounds; these are the groups at highest
risk for health inequities, and by 2045, the U.S. population will be “majority minority”. Children in lower
socioeconomic status (SES) families have poorer access to health care, resulting in greater risk of chronic
diseases as adults. The major adult chronic diseases affect 1 in 3 adults and account for more than 75% of US
health care spending. The major childhood determinants of adult disease are distinctly societal and
nonmedical: poverty, poor education, unhealthy social and physical environments, and unhealthy lifestyles
options. However, the current U.S. biomedical workforce lacks scientists trained to address child health
inequities and lacks diversity in the workforce to better engage underserved minority populations in research.
 To fill these gaps, we propose the Child Health Equity Research Program for Post-doctoral Trainees
(CHERPP-T), a mentored, research project-based training program that provides didactic training in rigorous
health services and clinical research methodologies, experiential research training, career development,
opportunities for community-academic partnerships, and a long-term network of mentors, collaborators, and
partners. The program will focus heavily on recruiting trainees from underrepresented racial/ethnic minority
groups (URM) by leveraging existing relationships with predoctoral and early career URM pipeline programs
for academic pediatricians. Health equity research will be defined as work that aims to improve or examine
outcomes for four main health disparity populations defined in the NIMHD Framework (race/ethnicity, low SES,
rural, sexual/gender minority). Doctoral level trainees will develop an independent research career focused on
achieving health equity across multiple domains and levels of influence on health, and acquire skills to improve
health outcomes at the level of the individual, family/organization, community, and population. We request two
trainees in year one and four trainees in subsequent years (two 1st year and two 2nd year fellows).
 The Specific Aims are to:
 1. Recruit outstanding URM fellows from a national applicant pool with attention to diversity in clinical and
 academic backgrounds, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity and gender;
 2. Equip fellows with a strong background in health equity research methodology and research skills;
 3. Support fellows in completion of an impactful, rigorous research project; and
 4. Establish and maintain a supportive and collaborative network of mentors for fellows.
 CHERPP-T's long term impact will be to increase URMs who are independently funded scientists in child
health fields, and by nature of their focus on child health equity and health disparities, CHERPP-T will also lead
to an increase in the numbers of underserved children, youth, and families enrolled and engaged in biomedical
research. These two key program impacts will in turn contribute greatly to reducing inequities in child health."
10865736,"The oral microbiome plays a crucial role not only in oral health but also in systemic health. Dysfunctional oral
microbiomes have been linked to various chronic human diseases. However, understanding how the
organization of the oral microbiome is connected to its function remains a major challenge. Next-generation DNA
sequencing has revolutionized the study of oral microbial communities by providing comprehensive information
about their composition. CLASI-FISH has contributed to our understanding by revealing the spatial organization
of the microbiome. While imaging can inform us about which microbes are in proximity to each other at the
micron scale, it cannot alone differentiate whether this spatial proximity is due to functional interactions or chance
occurrences. To overcome this limitation, our proposed study aims to investigate microbe-microbe adhesion as
a functional attribute of their interactions. We will employ a combination of expansion microscopy (ExM) and
multiplex FISH imaging, which will provide a unique opportunity to globally analyze microbial interactions at the
micron level. This approach will allow us to explore the functional aspects of microbial communities beyond their
spatial arrangement. Furthermore, the presence of thick biofilms or aggregates within their ecological niches
presents significant challenges for single-cell dissection and imaging, often leading to difficulties or ambiguities
in taxonomic assignment. Our proposed study will address this concern by quantifying the relative microbial
adhesion forces at the single-cell level. This will enhance our understanding of the forces governing microbial
interactions within biofilms and contribute to unraveling the complexity of the oral microbiome. Overall, this study
aims to investigate the functional attributes of the oral microbiome at the micron scale, bridging the gap between
microbial organization and function. By employing advanced microscopy techniques and quantifying microbial
adhesion forces, we hope to gain valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of the oral microbiome and its
implications for human health. There are three interconnected Aims: 1) To combine multiplex FISH imaging with
Expansion Microscopy. Here, the focus will be investigating the feasibility of combining multiplex peptide nucleic
acid (PNA) FISH imaging with ExM on an in vitro polymicrobial biofilm. 2) To quantify relative microbe-microbe
adhesion force. Here, expansion forces within the gel matrices will be calibrated through force-reference bead
strategy. Following PNA FISH hybridization on the polymicrobial biofilm, the microbial adhesion forces within the
biofilm will be quantified by comparison with gel expansion forces. 3) To evaluate species-level adhesion forces
within natural human oral biofilms. Here, we will validate our adhesion force measurement approach using a
diverse range of in vitro coaggregation pairs with established binding phenotypes. Then species-level adhesive
forces within human natural oral biofilms will be obtained. This independence award (PA-20-188) will foster my
independent research growth and allow me to accomplish my long-term career goal of becoming a productive,
independent translational scientist in the field of oral microbiology."
10865795,"Project Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating and complex neurodegenerative disorder with a crushing social and
economic burden currently affecting more than 6 million patients in the US. With the number of affected individu-
als projected to increase, identifying disease-modifying treatments and interventions for AD remains one of the
most critical undertakings in modern biomedical research. A critical step to the development of these interven-
tions involves characterizing the genes and pathways mediating AD risk and resilience. The objective of this
proposal is to explore the modulation of AD genetic risk by age and examine how caloric restriction (CR),
a lifespan-increasing intervention, can be harnessed to counter AD risk. The proposal will utilize state-of-
the-art single-nuclei multi-omic functional genomic analyses of healthy and AD human brain tissue, as well as
transgenic AD mouse models, to perform deep molecular characterization of AD risk and resilience across the
genetic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic layers. Aim 1 will dissect non-coding AD genetic risk through intensive
multi-omic molecular profiling of healthy and AD brains, allowing the nomination of causal variants, cell types,
and pathways mediating risk. Aim 2 will identify protective mechanisms in cognitively healthy, long-lived individ-
uals, including centenarians, and determine whether AD resilience manifests by maintaining a “young” state or
by compensating for detrimental age-related effects and AD genetic risk. This will involve comparison across a
broad age spectrum, including molecular profiles of young controls (aged 18-35) and AD patients. Aim 3 will
characterize the interplay between CR and neurodegeneration in genetically diverse AD mouse models. This
will provide insight into the pathways mediating lifespan-increasing interventions in the brain, their interaction
with high-risk and resilient genetic backgrounds, and their overlap with AD risk and resilience pathways in hu-
mans. Importantly, this proposal will directly address the connections between lifespan and AD resilience to
provide a more nuanced understanding of the potential of CR and its mimetics as therapeutic strategies for AD.
This proposal employs an innovative research approach combining observational and interventional study de-
signs with state-of-the-art computational techniques. This approach facilitates concurrent human and mouse
data analysis, expediting the discovery of molecular pathways mediating AD risk and resilience, with potential
implications for developing novel AD prevention strategies. Under the mentorship of Dr. Harari and co-mentors
Dr. Goate, Kaczorowski, Karch, and Lee, I will follow a rigorous training program to meet the aims of this K99/R00
award and transition into independent research leadership in the domain of AD and aging. This will include a
focus on neurobiology, the biology of aging, mouse models of AD, bioinformatics, and professional development,
achieved through courses, workshops, conferences, and advisory committee feedback. In summary, this pro-
posal addresses a critical gap in our understanding of AD and aging, with the additional skills acquired during
this award laying a solid foundation for my future independence in the molecular biology of AD."
10868525,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder, with numerous
molecular and phenotypic features (e.g., sex) that have been identified as modifiers of disease risk, resilience,
and progression. While single-omic (e.g. genomic or transcriptomics) contributions to the variability observed in
AD have been studied, there have not been many integrative approaches to holistically understand precise
mechanisms that link molecular pathways with clinical manifestations. With the abundance of longitudinal multi-
modal clinical data (e.g., UCSF electronic medical records) and the development of integrative knowledge
networks that link known relationships across multi-omic modalities (e.g., Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented
Knowledge Engine), there is an untapped opportunity to derive further insights into the disease.
I hypothesize that by utilizing integrative knowledge network representations on clinical datasets, I can
characterize AD heterogeneity and apply predictive modelling to identify potential clinical and molecular features
associated with AD risk, subtypes, and sex-specific differences. In Aim 1, I will characterize Alzheimer’s Disease
heterogeneity through association analysis and utilization of unsupervised machine learning approaches. In Aim
2, I will develop predictive modelling approaches for identifying clinical and molecular features associated with
AD progression. With this approach, I will aim to elucidate potential disease mechanisms underlying
heterogeneous clinical manifestations, allowing for improved patient stratification and personalized therapeutic
approaches.
To pursue this project, I have the support of my sponsor Dr. Marina Sirota, an expert in integrative computational
approaches and machine learning methods on clinical and omics data. I will also receive mentorship and support

will allow for meaningful contributions to improve AD diagnosis and treatment and ultimately strengthen my
training as an aspiring physician-scientist."
10868608,"Project Summary:
Although bacterial ribosomes have been biochemically interrogated for decades, unknown mechanisms of
regulation and quality control are regularly uncovered and targeted with new antibiotics. Major differences in
translation regulation between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria have come to light in recent years.
Although more than 200,000 infections per year in the United States are caused by antibiotic resistant Gram-
positive bacteria, major gaps remain in our understanding of how Gram-positives perform ribosome quality
control. To address these gaps, my research program will focus on two major areas. 1) We will identify and
characterize strategies used by Gram-positive bacteria to detect and rescue stalled ribosomes and investigate
the physiological impacts of ribosome stalling. Preliminary data from my laboratory supports a model in which
ribosome stalling in Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus anthracis results in frameshifting and premature translation
termination. This process is expected to result in toxic truncated proteins and trigger stress responses. We will
investigate this model using genetic, structural, and biochemical approaches. 2) We will determine how ribosome
flexibility and atypical translation events can be used by the cell to increase coding capacity. We are particularly
interested in how frameshifting and stop codon read-through regulates gene expression and how environmental
inputs control this type of regulation. We will also use unbiased high throughput genetics to uncover new
mechanisms that prevent stalling and that regulate programmed frameshifting and stop codon read-through."
10868765,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of the proposed study is to advance our understanding of the complex networks of biology
underlying variation in HIV viral load (VL) and latent reservoir (LR) among HIV+ individuals, and how cocaine
abuse (CA) affects identified biological networks.
With the success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and public health strategies to reduce HIV
incidence, much of the HIV burden in developed countries is now as a chronic disease, including among drug
users. Managing HIV progression (HP) and searching for an HIV cure are of paramount importance. Higher
pretreatment VL is associated with HP and is associated with a larger LR. An HIV cure is dependent on
eliminating the LR. Cocaine is one of the most frequently abused illicit drugs among HIV+ individuals and is
known to increase VL, worsen HP, slow decline of viral production after cART, and, we hypothesize, affect
the quantity of LR. Thus, there is a complex web of relationships among VL, LR, and CA, which are partially
driven by and mediated through genetic susceptibility and gene regulation. As concluded by Le Cleric et al.
(2019) in their recent review: “Only integrative approaches that combine all big data results and consider their
complex interactions will allow us to capture the global picture of HIV molecular pathogenesis. This novel
challenge will require large collaborative efforts and represents a huge open field for innovative
bioinformatics approaches.”
We propose Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetii) as a multi-method, multi-omic framework
for discovering and understanding the biology underlying HIV outcomes and the effect of CA. We will apply
Explainable Artificial Intelligence, network mapping, and Lines-of-Evidence integration to existing genome-,
methylome-, and transcriptome-wide data across a number of cohorts in the following aims:
  Aim 1: Identify gene networks underlying variation in HIV VL and LR applying GNetii.
  Aim 2: Identify differences in HIV associated gene networks by CA.
 This robustly designed study is significant and innovative: targeting key HIV outcomes affected by CA,
 applying big data techniques to identify gene networks across multiple omics (enhancing discovery and
 biological interpretation), and leveraging unique LR data. Our multiple Principal Investigator team includes
 expertise in HIV, drug abuse, and computational biology. Thus, we are likely to produce important new
 insights into key elements of HIV as a chronic disease: providing a basis for targeting unique features of CA
 that impact VL and LR, which make HIV management and a cure more challenging in this population."

10866725,"This developmental research grant award (R21) requests funds to characterize the social and transmission
networks of migrant workers in Greece as part of pandemic preparedness, to mitigate ongoing and future
coronavirus epidemics among vulnerable populations in diverse contexts. We aim to better understand
COVID-19 prevention, testing, treatment, vaccination, seroprevalence and immunogenicity in order to address
facilitators and barriers to COVID-19 prevention. Migrant workers comprise one of the foremost essential
worker categories, are at increased risk of COVID-19 transmission and at the same time have some of the
lowest rates of testing and vaccination. Critical to public health is improving COVID-19 prevention among these
populations and their larger social networks. Network analysis can better illuminate ongoing transmission
dynamics and the potential for future epidemics. Contact tracing and other strategies do not fully include the
larger social network and data are often limited due to the stigma associated with providing named contacts, as
well as mistrust in government, particularly for migrant workers subject to harsh immigration policies. Social
network analysis, following traditional egocentric network approaches that this team has expertise in, can
illuminate multiple networks (family, workplace, acquaintance) and develop metrics tied to disease
transmission such as density, bridging and transitivity. In addition, network analysis can better explain
transmission potential phenomena such as sharing of resources across household units, workplace networks
and other transmission potentials. Understanding the potential transmission dynamics would help develop
tailored interventions to limit the explosive transmission documented in the US and Europe. The study context
and team are ideal for this proposal. Athens Greece is the entry point to the largest migrant population in the
EU and Bangladeshi migrants are the second largest constituency. Although the target population is very
specific, it represents an extremely important stream of global migration that connects two populous world
regions, with salient epidemiological consequences for the entire globe. The PI has a track record of
collaborative work implementing participant recruitment protocols in Athens among vulnerable populations
through street based and community focused engagement. The PI and site-PI are joined by additional experts
in virology, demography and South Asian and migrant health. Accordingly, we aim to: 1) Characterize the
social networks of Bangladeshi migrant workers in Athens and measure features of their network structures -
degree, density and bridging – most relevant to COVID-19 transmission potential; 2) Determine individual (ie.
age, gender), contextual (ie employment type), network and structural (stigma, health care access) factors
associated temporally with SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroprevalence and immunogenicity status. We will collect
survey data and biologic samples to model COVID-19 transmission; and 3) Determine individual and network
level factors associated with prevention behaviors: social distancing, masking, testing and vaccination."
10870077,"SUMMARY
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. Curative radiotherapy + chemotherapy is
the standard of care for patients with inoperable or unresectable disease that has spread beyond the primary
tumor to the lymph nodes. Unfortunately, this treatment approach has a high recurrence of 15%-40% and
advanced treatments including immunotherapy combined with radiation increase toxicity to organs. Spillover
radiation to normal organs at risk (OAR) results from treatment margins to account for uncertainty in localizing
tumors and OARs. Despite being part of standard equipment, information from in-treatment room cone-beam
computed tomography scans (CBCTs) is currently used only in limited ways for patient positioning during
treatment, without simultaneous online localization of the tumor and each OAR. This proposal will use innovative
artificial intelligence (AI) methods, that have been trained from both CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
studies, to create auto-segmentation tools that can accurately localize the tumor and key OARs online at
treatment setup.
The proposed novel AI methodology is called “Cross-Modality Educed Learning” or CMEDL
(‘c-medal’). The key advantage of CMEDL is that MRI datasets, even from different patients, can be used, to
guide the CT/CBCT network and “learn” to extract features that emphasize the difference between tissue types
and produces accurate segmentations even in areas with little inherent contrast such as the mediastinum.
For
the first time, the clinical utility of what could be called AI-Guided Radiotherapy (AIGRT) segmentation tools will
be systematically studied in relation to their potential impact on treatment margin reduction and normal tissue
toxicity modeling for longitudinally segmented tumor and healthy tissues on CBCTs. Proposed AIGRT tools
would provide increased geometric confidence as well as provide a better basis for an after-delivery estimate of
delivered dose, and treatment toxicity, enabling better risk-benefit assessments for potential treatment
adaptations. Aim 1: Apply CMEDL methodology to develop lung tumor and OAR segmentations on planning
CTs. Aim 2: Extend the CMEDL methodology to longitudinally segment tumors and OARs on weekly CBCTs,
incorporating patient-specific anatomic and shape priors from planning CTs. Aim 3: Determine whether CMEDL
can enable improved (safer) lung cancer radiotherapy dose characteristics by performing automated planning
and delivery simulations, using in-house planning system. Project goal: To develop and rigorously test AIGRT
tools for lung cancer radiotherapy treatments. Potential impact: If successful, these innovative AI tools could be
deployed routinely, enabling (1) smaller margins and less radiotherapy toxicity for patients, including those with
very difficult-to-treat centrally located tumors and (2) providing tools for monitoring the need for plan changes.
These AIGRT tools could potentially be deployed to other disease sites, and once established be made widely
available as a pragmatic, generalizable technology for geometry guidance throughout the radiation treatment."

Maximizing access and minimizing costs of delivery are key challenges for optimizing the public health impact
of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Between January 2017 and December 2019, as part of Kenya's national
public sector PrEP roll-out, we conducted a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized pragmatic trial to catalyze scale-
up of PrEP delivery integrated in 25 public HIV clinics (The Partners Scale Up Project). We demonstrated that
PrEP can be delivered in African public health facilities using existing staff: >8000 initiated PrEP (53% women)
with reasonable continuation and high adherence among those returning. The study also highlighted major health
system barriers including lengthy visits with multiple stops (i.e., separate rooms for triage, HIV testing,
counseling, pharmacy) that burden the health system. For healthy HIV uninfected persons, long waiting at the
clinic, time away from work, and costs for getting to visits challenge persons taking PrEP. Efficient delivery
strategies could reduce costs, potentially improve client engagement and allow services to be available to a
larger number of people. In a short-term pilot study jointly funded by NIH and PEPFAR, we tested the feasibility
of one-stop PrEP provision (i.e., all PrEP services provided in a single room) at PEPFAR-supported clinics and
showed that one-stop service was feasible and highly acceptable to both PrEP users and providers. One-stop
significantly shortened wait time (>80%) without reducing provider-client contact time; PrEP initiation stayed
stable and there was suggestion of better early continuation and on-time visit attendance, indicating that one-
stop PrEP might add efficiencies to PrEP systems, without undermining quality. Building on our learning from
the randomized trial and the pilot study, we propose to conduct an effectiveness-implementation cluster-
randomized trial of one-stop to assess effectiveness to improve delivery efficiency and continuation on PrEP and
to rigorously study health system factors. We will randomize 12 public health facilities with established PrEP
programs in Western Kenya 1:1 to recruit and follow 1800 HIV-uninfected persons newly initiating PrEP to test
the effectiveness of one-stop care pathway compared to usual care pathway (Aim 1). Within the large program,
we will establish a randomly selected nested observational cohort of PrEP users (n=150, including clients who
start but discontinue) to study longitudinal HIV prevention behavior, including reasons for discontinuation and
how clients align PrEP use with HIV risk. Co-primary outcomes will be continuation and adherence quantified by
tenofovir-diphosphate levels in dried blood spots. We will use the Systems Analysis and Proctor's implementation
framework to evaluate implementation outcomes at the health system, facility, provider, and client-level (Aim 2).
Finally, we will conduct micro costing and time and motion studies to evaluate the costs and model the budget
impact and affordability of PrEP program with One-stop model (Aim 3). We have already demonstrated that PrEP
can be delivered in Kenyan public facilities by existing staff; this work will extend further, aiming for greater
efficiency and cost-saving, reduced provider workload, diminished client burden, and better PrEP continuation."
10873309,"ABSTRACT
 Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is so well known as the cause of cutaneous varicella (chickenpox) and
zoster (shingles) that it can be hard to imagine it as an enteric pathogen. VZV establishes latency during
varicella and returns to the skin in zoster when the neurons in which VZV reactivates have cutaneous
projections. Because a viremia occurs during varicella, VZV also infects and establishes latency in enteric
neurons that do not innervate the skin. VZV can reactivate in enteric neurons to give rise to “enteric zoster”,
which can occur without an associated rash. Because a rash may thus be absent, pain due to enteric zoster
can be occult. We have found, however, that VZV DNA, which is absent from normal saliva, is detectable in
saliva whenever an active (lytic) VZV infection is present in the body; thus, detection of salivary VZV is a non-
invasive diagnostic tool that, in combination with enteric signs and symptoms, helps to identify GI disorders
that involve VZV. We have found VZV transcripts and protein in endoscopic biopsies from patients with occult
abdominal pain and salivary VZV DNA, which verifies that these patients have enteric zoster. These
observations led us to investigate the potential association between VZV and achalasia in 15 patients. We
found salivary VZV DNA in 12/15 subjects examined prior to myotomy and, subsequently, VZV transcripts in
13/15 of the resected myotomy specimens. The tissue also contained VZV-immunoreactive (gE, gH, ORF40p)
neurons, nerve fibers, and multinucleated giant cells. To help determine whether this persistent VZV infection
of esophageal neurons is causally related to achalasia, we now propose to conduct a clinical trial of
valacyclovir to determine whether eradication of VZV alleviates achalasia symptoms and improves esophageal
function. We also plan to quantify viral load in relation to achalasia phenotypes and employ next generation
sequencing to look for a genetic basis of esophageal VZV reactivation. Finally, because mast cell accumulation
and degranulation have been reported in the achalasia esophagus and verified in our preliminary data we will
test the hypothesis that mast cell activation contributes to manifestations and/or painful symptoms of VZV-
associated achalasia. To gain insight into mechanisms of achalasia pathogenesis, we will also determine
whether VZV reactivates specifically in neurons thought to control relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter
(nitric oxide synthase) and/or the excitatory phase of esophageal peristalsis (choline acetyltransferase). Viral
destruction of nitrergic inhibitory neurons could be a cause of failure of LES smooth muscle to relax and either
or both of these neurons could contribute to the loss of peristalsis that accompanies achalasia."

 This application requests five years of research infrastructure support for the Population Studies Center
(PSC) at the University of Michigan (U-M). The PSC has and will continue to use this funding to create an
environment and resources that would not otherwise be available, including: (1) a vibrant intellectual
community of collaborative, interdisciplinary population scientists; (2) multimodal training and start-to-finish
support for scientists to enhance their competitiveness for peer-reviewed external funding in priority areas for
the NICHD Population Dynamics Branch (PDB); (3) small grants to fund high-priority pilot projects, methods
development, and computing resources; (4) seminars, hands-on workshops, and curated consulting across a
range of resources to advance methods for collecting and analyzing data; and (5) end-to-end research project
management support. In all activities, we focus particularly on the needs of junior scientists, and in the next five
years we will enhance the broader research community’s access. Since its founding by Ronald Freedman in
1961, PSC has united and supported an exceptional group of population scientists in the design, creation, and
use of new, publicly available data to advance population science. The Center continues to be unified by long-
term, signature projects, such as the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the Chitwan Valley Family
Study (CVFS) in Nepal—each representing major PDB investments. Together, they have produced more than
5,250 peer-reviewed publications, 300,000 citations, and thousands of data users. These highly significant
projects also serve as engines of collaboration within PSC, helping to spawn a new generation of innovative
projects focused on NICHD-PDB priorities. A key example is the American Family Health Study (AFHS), an
innovative U-M data collection project designed to provide content previously available from the NSFG, but
using a more flexible and cost effective web survey. Our objective in this application is to use P2C resources to
stimulate and support: new research on significant and emergent questions in population science; the use of
innovative approaches to data collection and analysis; and the development of a new generation of population
scientists within this productive environment, equipped with the tools to engage successfully in PDB research
priorities. PSC’s Administrative, Development and Scientific and Technical Cores currently provide innovative
administrative, intellectual, career development and technical resources to 69 affiliates from 14 disciplines and
8 schools and colleges across U-M, as well as a growing number of population dynamics researchers at other
institutions. Their work advances science in PSC’s three substantive PRAs: (1) Family and Intergenerational
Influences on Health and Wellbeing; (2) Reproductive Health, Fertility, and Romantic Relationships; and (3)
Population Health, the Life Course, and Biosocial Processes."
10873311,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Loneliness and social isolation are related, but distinct, social risk factors critical to the health and quality of life
of older adults in their last years of life. Loneliness is a subjective feeling of being alone, whereas social
isolation is an objective loss in the number of relationships with family, friends, or the community. Both social
risk factors are common and independently associated with poor health outcomes relevant to late life such as
depression, functional impairment, and mortality. Very little is known, however, about loneliness and social
isolation among the general population of older adults in the last years of life, particularly those with cognitive
impairment or Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia. Unfortunately, older adults with and without
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia may be particularly vulnerable to loneliness and social isolation
and their effects in the last years of life. While the last years of life have an intense focus on medical care, less
recognized social factors like loneliness may be more important to patients, especially for persons with
cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia. The objective of this study is to establish
the epidemiology of loneliness and social isolation in the last years of life among older adults with and without
cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia and determine their association with
intensive health care use at the end of life. We hypothesize that loneliness and social isolation are a common
source of suffering among older adults in their last years and associated with worse quality end-of-life health
care, especially for those with cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia. To test this
hypothesis, the following aims are proposed: Aim 1) Determine the prevalence and predictors of loneliness and
social isolation during the last four years of life among older adults with and without cognitive impairment or
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia using a nationally-representative cohort; Aim 2) Determine the
relationship between loneliness and social isolation with potentially burdensome healthcare at the end of life for
those with and without cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia; and Aim 3)
Develop an in-depth understanding of the experience of loneliness, social isolation, and potentially
burdensome healthcare among older adults with cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementia using qualitative interviews. This proposal will have a significant impact in characterizing a
substantial source of suffering among older adults with and without Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia
in the crucial end of life period and potential intervention strategies. I will obtain advanced training in
observational and health services research, qualitative analysis, implementation sciences, and clinical writing,
along with mentorship from national leaders in the field. This research and training will provide a foundation for
my long-term goal of developing interventions to address loneliness and social isolation and their health
consequences at the end of life for older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias."

10873332,"Thyroid cancer is the most common type of endocrine neoplasia and the fastest growing cancer type in the U.S.. Importantly, only small proportion of thyroid cancers have aggressive behavior and pose a substantial risk of cancer-related death, whereas the majority of them are indolent and cured by surgical removal. This is particularly true for well-differentiated thyroid papillary and follicular cancers, that have a 5-year survival of >95%, whereas the survival decreases to 50% for poorly differentiated cancer and to <10% for anaplastic cancer. In fact, anaplastic thyroid cancer is one of the most lethal types of human cancer with the median patient survival of 5 months after diagnosis. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of thyroid cancer dedifferentiation and finding novel therapeutic targets for these tumors is critically needed to decrease the morbidity and mortality from thyroid cancer. Recently, we identified ALK fusions in thyroid cancer, including poorly differentiated carcinomas and anaplastic carcinomas. We further showed that STRN-ALK fusion type is the most common ALK fusion found in thyroid cancer, and it is also most prevalent ALK fusion type found in dedifferentiated and lethal thyroid cancers. Moreover, during the previous cycle of the proposal, we established two animal models of thyroid-specific expression of STRN-ALK and showed that these mice develop dedifferentiated thyroid cancer that recapitulates human tumors. We also generated data pointing to the existence of two subtypes of poorly differentiated thyroid cancer with distinct expression of thyroid differentiation markers and response to radioiodine therapy. Importantly, ALK rearrangements that occur in other cancer types are an excellent therapeutic target, with several ALK inhibitors developed and approved by the FDA for treatment of ALK-positive lung cancer. However, whether ALK inhibitors can be used to treat ALK-positive thyroid poorly differentiated and anaplastic cancers or improve the effects of treatment of these tumors with radioactive iodine remain unknown. In the current proposal, we will take advantage of the abundant preliminary data and existing and newly generated mouse models to better understand the molecular mechanisms of thyroid cancer dedifferentiation, examine the response of STRN-ALK-positive tumors to ALK inhibitors, and determine if ALK inhibition can be exploited to restore iodine uptake and increase sensitivity to radioiodine at different stages of thyroid cancer dedifferentiation. These experiments will also provide an opportunity to test the growing list of available ALK inhibitors and hopefully validate for the first time an effective treatment for the devastating and frequently lethal forms of thyroid cancer."

10873591,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Western Kentucky University (WKU) is a regional comprehensive institution located in
southcentral Kentucky that is a member of the Kentucky INBRE program. Since the inception of
WKU in joining KY INBRE in 2002, a number of faculty members have been successful in
receiving funding from NIH and in training undergraduate students to perform biomedical
research. The objective of the Alteration and Renovation project outlined herein is to enhance
and maintain the research capacity of WKU to enable high-quality research in the fields of
microbiology, genetics, physiology, and neurobiology. More specifically, this proposal requests
to replace and upgrade essential ""workhorse"" research equipment (an autoclave, cage/bottle
washer) located on the third floor of the Engineering and Biological Sciences (EBS) building that
are in disrepair and obsolete (spare parts are no longer made to service these units). The old
autoclave and cage/bottle washer are located in the WKU Biotechnology Center (2,172 sq. ft)
and the WKU Vivarium (1,726 sq. ft), respectively, on the third floor of EBS. The current
autoclave in the WKU Biotechnology Center is currently nonfunctional which has created
unnecessary delays and barriers to conducting research. The current cage/bottle washer is still
operational but will likely fail in the next several years. These needed upgrades will directly
affect one WKU faculty member with a current NIH R15 grant who relies heavily upon a working
cage/bottle washer to maintain a mouse colony, five other WKU faculty members that are
currently or previously funded by KY INBRE and/or NIH, and 20-25 undergraduate students that
work with these faculty members to carry out biomedically relevant research. In addition, the
Ogden College of Science and Engineering at WKU is currently developing a new Neuroscience
major that will attract new students interested in biomedical research. In developing the
curriculum for this new major, there is a need for potentially new faculty hires in the fields of
Behavioral Neuroscience and Systems Neuroscience. If these new hires plan to utilize rodent
models, then it is necessary that a fully functioning cage/bottle washer be available for use.
These needed upgrades to basic (yet essential) research equipment will enable current and
future faculty, staff, and students to continue to carry out high-quality biological research with

10870275,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
La Crosse virus (LACV) is one of the most significant arboviral pathogens in North America, annually causing
clinical pediatric encephalitis, which are occasionally fatal. Severe neuroinvasive disease cases of LACV most
often occur in the Appalachian and Midwest regions of the United States (US) in children under the age of 16,
and can result in lifelong neurologic complications, including recurrent seizures, partial paralysis, and cognitive and
neurobehavioral abnormalities. Long-term sequelae represent a substantial health and economic burden in terms
of cost per patient. No licensed countermeasures, such as vaccines or antivirals, are currently available. To
date, only two of the three known LACV lineages, Lineages I and II (principally active within the Appalachian and
Midwest regions of the US), are associated with human disease. Lineage III, which is now identified in the
Northeastern region of the US, has not yet been associated with clinical disease. My research group recently
highlighted the existence of regional variants of LACV in the Northeast (Eastwood et al. 2020) and showed that
Lineage III LACV persists locally in multiple species of Aedes mosquitoes. This virus lineage presents an
undetermined health threat and investigation is warranted to determine whether the lack of Lineage III-derived
cases, to date, is due to under-diagnosis of clinical illness (lack of case recognition), differences in virus virulence,
low prevalence of infection in mosquito vectors (effectively limiting human exposure to biting activity in regions
where the virus circulates), or limited vector competence by these mosquito species. Our long-term goal is to
evaluate the public health significance and risk of emergence of lineage III LACV. We question why human
cases have not occurred in the face of entomological risk, and aim initially to study the mosquito vector
competency of different lineage strains to determine whether the known presence of LACV in the Northeast is a
threat to public health, consistent with the more traditional regions. Having established that Lineage III LACV is
circulating in mosquitoes in the Northeastern US, and that isolates of LACV strains present different in vitro
phenotypic characteristics, such as altered growth rates, plaque morphologies, and murine virulence (Wilson et
al. 2021), this pilot study seeks to address the ability of novel LACV strains to transmit in the vector, with the
central hypothesis that this distinct lineage is maintained vertically in local populations of mosquitoes with
limited horizontal transmission, resulting in the observed reduced incidence of human disease. We will evaluate
both horizontal and vertical transmission of LACV in both a native mosquito species (Aedes triseriatus) and an
invasive species (Aedes albopictus) as candidate LACV III disease vectors. The proposed project is an important
step to understanding whether Lineage III LACV poses a public health risk to a substantially urbanized
geographical region. Subsequent studies will be aimed at understanding mechanisms of lineage differences,
climatic impacts in vector competency for LACV, and surveillance of humans and vertebrate hosts to explore the
incidence, prevalence, and risk of further emergence of LACV in novel regions of the US."

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are inflammatory diseases that affect the airways
and, together, are the largest causes of disability and mortality from chronic respiratory disorders worldwide. At
the heart of the pathophysiology of both diseases is altered airway epithelial cell (AEC)-immune cell interactions
with aberrant activation of innate and adaptive immunity, notable for the accumulation of activated airway T cells
and B cells. It is thought that pathogenic AEC-myeloid cell-CD4+ T cell circuits underlie the pathophysiology of
asthma, while AEC-myeloid cell-CD8+ T cell circuits predominate in COPD, but the diversity of AECs and immune
cells involved are only now receiving scrutiny. In particular, rare AEC subtypes, including tuft, hillock, microfold,
and neuroendocrine cells, are known to secrete immune cell-active mediators, but their role in human disease
has not been established. Additionally, airway cellular structures such as hillock islands and inducible bronchial
associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) are immunologically active in asthma and COPD, but their role in disease
pathogenesis is unknown. Furthermore, studies suggest that the T cell and B cell response to specific antigens,
whether host-, allergen- and/or microbe-derived, may be important in the pathophysiology of asthma and COPD,
but current efforts have not deeply characterized the specificity and function of the adaptive immune cells that
accumulate in airways, nor their interactions with specific AEC populations. Our overall objective is to
comprehensively define the signaling and spatial relationships of common and rare AEC cell types, airway
structures such as the hillock and iBALT, and specific airway immune cell populations in asthma and COPD to
ultimately define therapeutic approaches that precisely target disease-specific mechanisms. Our group has
established protocols and methods for safely sampling asthmatic and COPD airways from well-defined patient
cohorts and for obtaining tissue from diseased lung explants and donor lungs with asthma that were rejected for
transplants. Using these methods, we have characterized the cellular profiles of AEC and immune cells in
healthy, asthmatic, and COPD lungs and have defined some of the critical AEC-immune cell interactions within
the airways of these subjects. We hypothesize that aberrant AEC-immune cell interactions involving AEC
subtypes as well as airway structural features such as hillock islands and iBALT drive chronic immune activation
in the airway, which ultimately promotes activation of airway-resident memory T cells and B cells, thus
establishing a persistent inflammatory state that shapes the clinical course of asthma and COPD. The specific
aims are 1) to determine and compare the transcriptional and spatial profiles of AEC-immune cell interactions in
asthma and COPD, and 2) to define T cell and B cell receptor repertoires in the airways of patients with asthma
and COPD. A deeper understanding of AEC-immune cell interactions in asthma and COPD will help define
pathogenic mechanisms of each disease and may identify disease-specific therapeutic targets."

Iron(II)- and 2-(oxo)glutarate-dependent (Fe/2OG) oxygenases catalyze hydroxylation, halogenation,
cyclization, dehydrogenation, and stereoinversion of aliphatic carbon centers, C–H-bond-activation reactions
that collectively represent a holy grail of synthetic chemistry. Biosynthetic pathways to important natural-
product drugs are replete with these enzymes, and the pharmaceutical industry is beginning to leverage
evolved versions of Fe/2OG oxygenases as biocatalysts for ""green"" processes to their synthetic drugs. Recent
studies of Fe/2OG hydroxylases, halogenases and cyclases by the Penn State group show that the disposition
of the substrate relative to the common iron(IV)-oxo (ferryl) and iron(III)-hydroxo/substrate-radical
intermediates may be crucial for control of reaction outcome. On the basis of data available so far, we
hypothesize that the structural rearrangement of the metallocofactor rather than the substrate positioning is the
primary factor directing regioselectivity. Therefore, in this work, we will perform spectroscopic characterization
of faithful reactive-state analogs to gain first-hand insight as to how the individual enzymes adjust the structure
of the active complex and to uncover common modes that direct reactivities in the superfamily of Fe/2OG
oxygenases. In this project, we will innovate and deploy a suite of novel intermediate mimics and spectroscopic
probes/methodologies to resolve the geometries of the key intermediate states in the pharmaceutically relevant
subclasses of Fe/2OG enzymes. Our elucidation of how the cofactor structures and relative dispositions of the
substrates dictate the divergent outcomes will inform efforts to discover novel members of this superfamily and
assign their phenotypes. Ultimately, information obtained in this project will be instrumental in developing new
biocatalysts for drug synthesis."
10881632,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most commonly occurring cancer in humans, and is particularly prevalent in
the Veteran population. BCC is driven by DNA damage to the interfollicular epidermis, the body’s outermost
protective barrier. Preliminary studies demonstrate that DNA damage activates inflammasome signaling in
dermal fibroblasts, which enhances epithelial cell proliferation and plasticity in wild-type interfollicular
epidermis, characteristics that are associated with tumorigenesis. Strikingly, however, the role of dermal
fibroblasts in cutaneous skin cancer development has not been adequately addressed. Cancer-associated
fibroblasts (CAFs) are predominant in tumor stroma, and have been proposed to drive the progression of many
epithelial cancers, including BCC. However, the direct role of CAFs in cutaneous skin cancer progression is
currently unknown. The primary goal of this CDA-2 research proposal is to test the hypothesis that
inflammasome signaling from dermal CAFs promotes BCC development. This research will be the first to
deeply characterize 1) epidermal and dermal live cell dynamics during BCC formation, 2) the role of CAFs in
BCC development, 3) CAF necessity and sufficiency for skin cancer progression, 4) CAF signaling changes
during skin tumorigenesis, and 5) the impact of specific CAF signaling subpopulations on skin cancer cell
behaviors. Transgenic mouse models, live intravital imaging, patient-derived xenografts, 3D organotypic co-
culture, as well as single cell analyses of primary skin cancer tissue from Veteran patients will be employed to
investigate these research aims. In addition, this work will take place in a highly collaborative, supportive and
rigorous research environment, and will be accompanied by both technical training and formal coursework in
cancer mouse models, ex vivo organoids, CRISPR/Cas9 technology, mass cytometry, and single cell RNA
sequencing. The data generated in the CDA-2 training phase, coupled with the extensive technical expertise
and career development skills that will be attained, will provide a strong foundation for the long-term goals of
securing VA MERIT award funding and establishing a successful independent research program at a VA-
affiliated institution. The broad objective of the proposed research is to significantly improve Veteran healthcare
by informing the development of targeted therapies to effectively treat and prevent cutaneous skin cancer.
Additionally, this research may provide important insights into therapeutic approaches for treating other
epithelial cancers as well as inflammatory skin disorders that are also common among Veterans."

BCCMA: Basic and Translational Mechanisms of Cancer Initiation of the Urothelium in Veterans
Exposed to Carcinogens: CMA2: Role of PPAR- in the Formation and Progression of Carcinoma in
situ of the Bladder
Although bladder cancer (BC) ranks the fourth among the most prevalent cancers in the Veterans, it has
received a level of attention far less than many other prevalent cancers in basic, translational and clinical
research. Carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the bladder is a precancerous lesion, believed to be caused by specific
carcinogens in tobacco smoke, occupation and environment, has a high rate of recurrence and progression to
invasion and metastasis. Despite its critical importance, major knowledge gaps exist regarding the genomic,
epigenetic and transcriptional underpinning of CIS, leading to unmet challenges in early detection, accurate
prediction of progression and prevention. Two basic scientists and two clinicians from four VA Medical Centers
have joined forces to tackle the molecular mechanisms of CIS formation and progression in an interdisciplinary
and collaborative manner by sharing ideas, reagents and resources. CMA1 will focus on the mechanistic
bases of human CIS regulated by EZH2 and the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2). CMA2 aims to
understand the transcriptional controls, especially PPAR-γ, whereby CIS forms and progresses to muscle
invasion. CMA3 will use epigenetic approaches to prevent or delay smoking-related BC by targeting lysine-
specific demethylase 1. CMA4 will develop a biomarker-driven, artificial intelligence-enhanced cystoscopic
strategy to detect CIS and assess treatment response. Extensive crosstalk and interactions have been put in
place in each CMA to enhance the synergy and efficiency of the entire program. Together, this collaborative
project should significantly advance our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic bases of CIS, yielding
novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for its sensitive detection, effective treatment and early prevention.
Rationale: While there is a clear need for us to better understand the fundamental mechanisms underlying
how BC initiates and progresses, efforts in this area remain grossly inadequate. Bladder is an easily accessible
organ, and lesions suspected of any malignant potential can theoretically be detected early and monitored
effectively. A typical example is the CIS lesion, a precancerous entity of the bladder mucosa lining that is highly
recurrent and frequently advances to muscle invasion despite constant surveillance and local therapies.
Accumulating evidence suggests that CIS is highly heterogeneous, exhibiting diverse biological behaviors and
risks of progression. However, no reliable biomarkers exist to differentiate the genetic or molecular variants
within CIS. In this application, we have devised a series of physiologically relevant, in vivo experiments to
examine whether alternations in specific transcription factors that control normal bladder epithelial growth and
differentiation affect the formation and progression of CIS into different subtypes of muscle-invasive bladder
cancer. We will also assess how biologically different CIS lesions have differed immune status and how that
information can be explored to improve responses to local immunotherapeutics.
Clinical implications: We expect our proposed studies to offer new insights into the molecular bases
underlying the heterogeneity of CIS and the relationship between CIS lesions and the molecular subtypes of
muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Our studies should yield biologically validated and mechanistically based
biomarker sets that can potentially be used clinically for early CIS detection, risk stratification and prediction of
progression. Our studies should also identify new molecules that are proven critical for CIS formation and
progression for therapeutic targeting."

Lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) is a common disease whose incidence and prevalence increase as the
population ages and the the current therapeutic approaches are ineffective. LUTD is strongly associated with
bladder smooth muscle (BSM) hypertrophy secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-induced partial
bladder outlet obstruction (PBOO). The molecular pathogenesis of BPH and BSM dysfunction is poorly
understood; filling this gap in our knowledge will likely lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets and
more effective LUTD drugs or management strategies. We and others have demonstrated that the contractile
dysfunction, increased mitochondrial ROS and reduced ATP levels of BSM in the obstructed bladder is
associated with the overexpression of the intermediate filament (IF) proteins desmin and vimentin. Previous
studies as well as preliminary data presented herein suggest JNK2 as a major effector of the BSM contractile
dysfunction induced by the overexpression of desmin and vimentin and demonstrate that an IFs/JNK2-
dependent mechanism contributes to the contractile dysfunction in bladder outlet obstruction. In the current
proposal we have identified via microarray significant induction of the mitochondrial protein G0S2 in human
and murine BSM strips and cells overexpressing desmin and vimentin. Our additional preliminary data further
demonstrate that inhibition of G0S2 expression decreases phospho-JNK levels, increases mitochondrial ATP,
and decreases the ROS production in desmin- and vimentin- overexpressing murine and human BSM strips
and cells. Further, we demonstrate the interaction of G0S2 with voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC).
VDAC promotes ATP/ADP exchange across the mitochondrial outer membrane in association with adenine
nucleotide translocase and mitochondrial creatine kinase. G0S2 binding to VDAC presumably disrupts the
ATP/ADP exchange thereby, reducing the mitochondrial ATP level and increasing the mitochondrial ROS
production. We hypothesize that mitochondrial G0S2 mediates desmin- and vimentin-induced BSM contractile
dysfunction via phospho-JNK2. We further hypothesize that G0S2 interaction with the VDAC promotes the
mitochondrial ROS production and the ROS-induced phospho-JNK2 contributes to the contractile dysfunction.
Three Specific Aims are designed to address these hypotheses. In Aim 1, we will establish the role of
mitochondrial G0S2 in IF protein overexpression-induced BSM contractile dysfunction. In Aim 2 we will
determine whether IF protein overexpression-induced BSM contractile dysfunction is due to G0S2 and VDAC
interaction. In Aim 3 we will employ in vivo models to establish the role of G0S2 and JNK2 in murine PBOO
induced BSM contractile dysfunction: We expect our studies to delineate a mechanism of contractile
dysfunction mediated by G0S2 and thus identify therapeutic targets for the treatment of PBOO/LUTD."

10881809,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) are the leading causes of morbidity and
premature death in youth and adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Recent advances in continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) and automated insulin delivery systems have facilitated improved glycemic control, but the
residual risk of CVD and DKD remains high. Obesity and insulin resistance (IR) have also accompanied
intensive glycemic therapy and may accentuate arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction, each of which is
known to predict CVD in T1D. Thus, studies are needed to explore the cardio-renal impact of new adjunctive
therapies in T1D informed by the transformative cardiovascular outcome trials in type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) mitigate major adverse cardiac events in adults with
T2D and support weight loss. Our group has characterized subclinical cardiorenal disease in young persons
with T1D, reporting abnormalities in cardiac function, central arterial stiffness, endothelial function, kidney
function, and insulin sensitivity. These cardiorenal abnormalities were also worse with increasing BMI. Our
group has also documented attenuated subclinical cardiac dysfunction and aortic stiffness with GLP-1RA
without increased risk of hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis, in both adults with T2D and in animal models
of diabetes. To date, limited data exist regarding CVD, IR or DKD-related outcomes in young adults with T1D
in response to GLP-1RA. Indeed in T1D, studies with GLP-1RA have focused primarily on weight and glucose
lowering. Thus, there is a gap in our understanding of the cardiorenal impact of these agents in T1D.
To evaluate the effects and underlying mechanisms of GLP-1RA on cardiovascular and kidney function as well
as insulin sensitivity in T1D, we propose a 6-month randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study in 52
young adults with T1D (ages 18-40 years) using once weekly subcutaneous semaglutide as a mechanistic
probe. The primary outcomes will be change in central and peripheral pulse wave velocity (PWV) by aortic MRI
and SphygmoCor. Additional outcomes will include subclinical cardiac function by cardiac MRI, endothelial
function by flow mediated vasodilatation (FMDBA), insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps,
intraglomerular hemodynamic function by iohexol and p-aminohippurate clearance, albuminuria by urine
albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and glycemic variability by CGM. Innovative translational assessments of nitric
oxide (NO) bioavailability, endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activation, reactive oxygen species
(ROS)/oxidative stress from endovascular J-wire biopsies and endothelial glycocalyx from sublingual
assessments will provide mechanistic insight."

The preschool years (2-5 years of age) is a critical timeframe to shape the lifetime risk of obesity. While the
causes of obesity are complex, appetitive traits related to overeating, such as high food approach and low food
avoidance, are robustly associated with a greater BMI among children. Some children are genetically pre-
disposed to expressing obesogenic appetitive traits, and those traits may mediate a genetic risk for obesity.
Separately, parental feeding practices are emerging as an important, yet modifiable, influence on children’s
obesity risk. Coercive control feeding practices, such as strictly limiting a child’s intake of highly palatable foods
(restriction) and using food to control children’s negative emotions (emotional feeding), are believed to be
detrimental for young children because they impede self-regulatory skills around eating and may increase the
saliency of highly palatable foods. Our goal for this project is to disentangle the inter-relationships between
coercive control feeding practices, children’s obesogenic appetitive traits, and children’s dietary intake across
the preschool years to understand how coercive control feeding practices ultimately impact children’s adiposity
gain over time. Importantly, we aim to understand how those effects differ based on children’s underlying genetic
risk for obesity. We hypothesize that parents will respond to children’s obesogenic appetitive traits by exhibiting
more coercive control feeding practices (restriction, emotional feeding), which in turn, will promote future
increase in obesogenic appetitive traits and overconsumption, leading to excess adiposity gain among children.
Importantly, we hypothesize children with a high genetic risk for obesity will be most susceptible to the negative
effects of coercive control feeding practices because food is highly salient for them. We will test our hypotheses
among a cohort of children aged 2.5 years old using a longitudinal study design with repeated assessments
every 6 months until children are 5 years old. We include validated assessments of parental feeding practices,
child appetitive traits and usual dietary intake. We will assess children’s genetic risk for obesity via candidate
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a polygenic risk score. Importantly, our novel approach expands
upon previous research by including our lab’s proven, objective paradigm to measure children’s food approach
and overconsumption. Specifically, we will use eye-tracking to measure children’s attentional bias to food, an
objective metric of food approach. We also include an eating in the absence of hunger paradigm to objectively
measure children’s overconsumption. Study findings can be leveraged to develop tailored strategies to help
parents support healthy eating behaviors among their young children that consider the heterogeneity in
obesogenic appetitive traits among young children due to genetic risk factors."

To grow and survive, bacteria rely on a multitude of physiological processes occurring along and across the cell
envelope, including nutrient uptake, respiration, and the secretion of waste products. These processes are
sustained by a dense arrangement of proteins located within and along the cell envelope. To better predict
bacterial growth behavior in different environments it is thus essential to better understand how bacterial cells
control their envelope proteome depending on their cell-physiological state and the specific characteristics of the
environment they encounter. This research integrates experiments and mathematical modeling to promote such
a systems-level understanding of the cell envelope in rod-shaped Gram-negative bacteria.
Envelope proteins in Gram-negative bacteria are distributed across two membranes and the periplasmic space
enclosed by these membranes. As the dimensions of these envelope layers are inherently linked to the size of
the cell, this study tightly integrates cell-size control to investigate how envelope protein masses and envelope
size are regulated by the cell. Experimentally, microscopy, genetic engineering, and a novel biochemical assay
are combined to quantify changes in cell size and the envelope proteome across bacterial species and for a
broad range of physiologically distinct growth conditions. Mathematically, Bayesian inference and resource
allocation models are integrated to dismantle the interdependence of measured quantities and specifically probe
the role of two hypothesized constraints of envelope composition and cell size control: macromolecular density
and aspect-ratio maintenance. The three specific aims are: (i) Revealing the fundamental growth laws of
envelope composition and cell size in different Gram-negative species. (ii) Establishing a dynamical resource
allocation model to predict adjustment of cell size and envelope composition over the cell cycle. (iii) Probing the
molecular regulation of envelope-dependent aspect-ratio control.
Major pathogenic bacteria belong to the group of rod-shaped Gram-negatives considered in this study, including
five of the seven ESKAPEE pathogens known for their aggressive acquisition of multiple antibiotics resistance.
As such, this systematic study of envelope and size control builds an important physiological foundation for the
targeted development of novel prevention and treatment strategies against an increasing global health threat."

Public health departments increasingly use predictive modeling to guide decisions and resource allocation for the control of infectious diseases in the United States, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. These novel predictive models offer promise to better identify high-risk populations to precisely deploy interventions such as vaccination, yet there is limited evidence on how these models are used by public health departments and whether they translate into policy that reduces infectious diseases. The major scientific problem I seek to address is to identify whether, and to what degree, predictive models can be incorporated into public health practice and translated into policy by public health departments to improve the control of infectious diseases. By leveraging a key collaboration with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and rich epidemiologic data sources, I will address a key public health challenge of how to optimally allocate limited resources for targeted vaccination against pertussis, seasonal influenza, and hepatitis A. The goal is to target vaccines to the highest-risk locations and populations to reduce the number of outbreaks and infections. My hypothesis is that public health departments can effectively incorporate predictive mathematical models on optimal targeting of vaccination into their policy decisions. I will apply my expertise in predictive modeling and infectious diseases to develop open-source, predictive modeling tools for county public health departments to allocate targeted vaccination to the highest-risk populations, and study the step-by-step implementation of these models in public health use. My broad, long-range goal is to evaluate the causal public health impact of using predictive models to guide decisions on vaccination in public health departments. In Aim 1, I will develop and validate predictive models to optimally target vaccines to high-risk locations and populations (age, demographic and risk factor) for pertussis, seasonal influenza, and hepatitis A. The model will provide comparative effectiveness and costs of various targeted vaccination strategies, and an overall vaccine recommendation specific to the county and infectious disease. In Aim 2, I will apply methods from implementation science to optimize the user experience for public health officials to maximize usability, communication, and uptake of model-based vaccine recommendations. In Aim 3, I will implement the predictive models of targeted vaccination in California public health departments and measure implementation outcomes in a pilot study. This work will provide the foundation for a future innovative trial with CDPH that randomizes county public health departments and evaluates whether using model-based predictions on optimal vaccine allocation can causally reduce cases and outbreaks. This proposed work has the potential to unlock new scientific directions of translating predictive models into common practice in public health, which can then be applied across many infectious diseases."
10878319,"Abstract
We discovered that nuclear reprogramming of somatic cells to a different somatic cell lineage, or
induced pluripotent stem cells, requires activation of inflammatory signaling within the cell. Specifically,
pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) mediate a cell-autonomous
innate immune response via NFKb and IRF3. We found that this inflammatory signaling causes global
changes in the expression and/or activity of epigenetic modifiers to increase DNA accessibility and
fluidity of cell phenotype. Subsequent work has suggested that this process of “transflammation” may
be involved in vascular regeneration. Specifically, we have shown that fibroblasts in an ischemic region
can be transformed into endothelial cells (ECs) through an “angiogenic transdifferentiation” process.
This process contributes to the recovery of perfusion in the ischemic region, as the recovery of the
microvasculature, and the restoration of blood flow in an ischemic region is antagonized by factors
required for angiogenic transdifferentiation (e.g., inflammatory signaling). My recent work indicates that
cell metabolism may be an important contributor to this process. Specifically, a glycolytic shift is
induced by inflammatory signaling which is required for the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts to ECs.
Thus, regulating cell metabolism within fibroblasts to facilitate their transdifferentiation into reparative
ECs may be a novel strategy for treating ischemia. To determine the molecular metabolic pathway that
leads to transdifferentiation, we will alter the function of key metabolic enzymes in mice
pharmacologically and genetically in vivo to confirm our proposed pathway and demonstrate the
metabolic regulation of transdifferentiation in a mouse model of peripheral artery disease (PAD). We
will pursue experiments to trace key metabolites and demonstrate their importance in mediating DNA
accessibility and transdifferentiation to identify their role in epigenetic regulation in cell fate transition.
Completion of these studies will demonstrate the novel concept that metabolic regulation within cells
contributes to their fate and provide novel targets to enhance this process for the treatment of PAD."

Residents in rural areas have higher rates of chronic diseases, infant mortality, disability, ambulatory care
sensitive hospitalizations, and age-adjusted mortality than their urban counterparts. People living in rural areas,
particularly those with fewer financial resources, also face many challenges accessing primary care. To date,
little is known about the acute and intermediate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary care utilization
and quality of care among rural patients. The rapid and wide-scale adoption of telemedicine (TM) resulting
from the COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to understand if TM can improve utilization or
quality of preventive healthcare for rural patients. Research is critically needed to examine whether differences
in preventive care utilization among rural/urban patients is increasing and whether TM has improved or
worsened disparities in preventive care use and quality of care.
To meet this need we propose to address the following aims: (1) assess changes in frequency of preventive
care visits and method of preventive care received (e.g., in-person, video, phone, patient portal) among rural
and urban patients as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) examine differences in the use of TM and the
type of primary care for which TM was used among rural and urban patients as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic; and (3) evaluate the effect of TM use on the quality and equity of care for chronic physical and
mental health conditions among rural and urban patients as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
We will use electronic health record (EHR) data from a network of 800+ community health centers in 20 states
that are hosted and standardized by OCHIN. The EHR data are geocoded to patient addresses and linked to
US Census and USDA Rural Urban Commuting Area data. These unique features will allow use of community-
level data and geospatial analysis to identify communities with unmet needs and help identify contextual
factors affecting use of primary care and outcomes for underserved, rural patients. Use of this data also
represents a significant advancement in the study of rural populations because data on patients without
insurance or lapses in insurance, of which rural patients are overrepresented, are missing from claims data
often used in health services research. Rural populations are a priority for AHRQ, and Healthy People 2020
and the National Institute of Health identified rural health disparities and the lack of research on rural health as
top priorities. Findings from this research will advance knowledge on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
low-income, rural populations and the effect of TM on use and quality of primary care. This innovative research
project has the potential to improve healthcare access and quality of care for low-income, rural patients."

Fatal or impairing neurological diseases, including movement disorders, brain cancers, psychological
disorders, epilepsies, malformations, and memory disorders, impose heavy burdens on both individuals and
society at large. Transcranial magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound surgery (tMRgFUS) is an
extremely promising, minimally invasive treatment modality for neurological diseases whereby sound waves
are focused to a specific region of the brain. Because it is noninvasive, the efficacy of tMRgFUS procedure
heavily relies on the accuracy and information content of the guidance technology.
This study proposes to improve the treatment efficacy of nearly all tMRgFUS surgeries by eliminating a
ubiquitous impediment to accurate and information-rich guidance MRI: the acoustic coupling medium.
Interactions between the coupling media and guidance imaging impede tMRgFUS efficacy and translation. For
example, while FDA-approved tMRgFUS treatments for essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease can rely on
real-time patient feedback to compensate for errors in guidance MR imaging, other tMRgFUS indications cannot
access patient feedback because either the patient is unconscious, or the consequences of treatment errors
appear only days later. In these cases, guidance imaging errors imposed by the coupling bath cannot be
compensated and degrade treatment efficacy
To meet this need, our study proposes a dilute, iron-based coupling media (IBCM) that will eliminate coupling-
media-induced errors in MRI guidance imaging while maintaining the coupling and cooling functionality critical
to acoustic transmission. The specific aims of the study are as follows.
Aim 1: Develop novel surface–modified iron oxide nanoparticles for an IBCM. Dilute, aqueous, surface-
modified iron oxide nanoparticles can accelerate MRI signal decay such that, during image acquisition, a
coupling medium will contribute negligible effects to guidance imaging. However, aqueous nanoparticles also
agglomerate and seed treatment-impeding cavitation nucleation in the prefocal acoustic field. This aim will
develop novel surface-modified particles that, upon suspension, accelerate MRI signal decay without
promoting prefocal nucleation.
Aim 2: Investigate the effects of IBCM suspension fluid properties on cavitation nucleation. Fluid
properties play a critical role in particle suspension, acoustic coupling, subject cooling, and cavitation
nucleation. This aim will investigate cavitation nucleation within the IBCM and how suspension fluid properties,
such as pH, temperature, gas content, and flow state, can modify or suppress the nucleation process while
maintaining suspension, coupling, and cooling capabilities.
Aim 3: Enhance MRI guidance for tMRgFUS through the use of an IBCM. This aim will quantify the value
of the IBCM designed in Aims 1 and 2 for tMRgFUS by measuring image quality metrics derived from guidance
MRI scans of human subjects. This aim will also develop novel MRI guidance techniques that were previously
rendered impossible due to severe image corruptions imposed by the acoustic coupling medium.
The resulting IBCM will improve image quality for nearly all guidance techniques employed during, or undergoing
development for, tMRgFUS, by rendering the acoustic coupling medium invisible to the MRI scanner without
sacrificing necessary acoustic coupling and cooling functionality."

The objective of this proposal is to understand how the first elements of olfactory circuitry are correctly wired
together during embryonic development. Odorant sensing neurons project axons from the olfactory epithelium
to the olfactory bulb in the brain. Each olfactory sensory neuron in the epithelium chooses a single odorant
receptor to express from a very large gene repertoire. Remarkably, all the sensory neurons that have chosen
the same odorant receptor to express extend axons that converge together in specific reproducible locations
within the olfactory bulb. This research proposal addresses how olfactory sensory axons locate their specific
targets in the brain. This project takes advantage of the relative simplicity of the zebrafish olfactory system and
its developmental and experimental accessibility to study the guidance of sensory neurons between the
olfactory epithelium and the bulb. In the first Aim, single cell RNA sequencing is used to identify cell surface or
secreted proteins that are differentially expressed between groups of olfactory sensory neurons whose axons
target different and distinct regions in the olfactory bulb. These are candidate genes involved in targeting, and
their function will be assessed by knocking them down one at a time and testing whether OSN axons target
their correct locations in the olfactory bulb. In the second Aim, we will examine the role an important family of
axon guidance cues, the slits, play in directing olfactory sensory axons to their appropriate target regions in the
bulb. These studies build towards a systems level understanding of how an important functional circuit is
assembled during development. This knowledge will be essential in the formulation of therapies for the
regeneration and repair of olfactory circuitry in aging or anosmic patients."
10881758,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and risks are disproportionately high in veterans.
Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) accounts for half of all lung cancer cases, but effective treatments are lacking in
part due to an incomplete understanding of LUAD biology. LUAD tumors originate from airway secretory
epithelia, and mucin expression is prevalent and associated with LUAD aggressiveness. However,
mechanisms by which mucins affect LUAD pathogenesis are poorly understood. The overarching concept of
this proposal is that aberrant epithelial growth in LUAD is potentiated by two polymeric mucins--MUC5AC and
MUC5B. Though required for airway defense in health, MUC5AC and MUC5B misexpression in LUAD
correlates with invasiveness, recurrence, and mortality, especially in patients with activating mutations in
KRAS--the most common oncogenic driver of LUAD. We validated MUC5AC causatively in urethane and
activated-Kras expression mouse models of LUAD. In animals lacking Muc5ac (‘MUC in humans, ‘Muc’ in
mice), tumor number and size decreased by ~50%. The relative tumor-promoting effects of Muc5b on its own
or with Muc5ac are not yet known. We seek to close this significance gap here. We also seek to determine
molecular mechanisms for polymeric mucin-mediated tumor promotion. Studies by us and by others have
identified numerous signals that stimulate LUAD, including mucinous LUAD subtypes. Upstream signaling
pathways converge on mucins and their biosynthetic machinery. Individual MUC5AC and MUC5B molecules
are extraordinarily large. They multimerize, and they become even more massive through addition of sugars to
their central glycosylation domains. Accordingly, protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is tightly regulated during
polymeric mucin biosynthesis. Mucin translation, folding, and dimerization occur in the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) and involve formation of hundreds of disulfide bonds. To handle these demands, mammals express a
mucous cell specific isoform of the ER stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE-1, also called ER-to-
nucleus signaling protein, or ERN). ERN1 is ubiquitously expressed and is crucial for ER stress-triggered
apoptosis, but an isoform called ERN2 is restricted to mucous cells where it is required for sustaining mucin
synthesis despite high levels of ER stress. This adaptation is accomplished by direct binding of ERN2 to
ERN1 and subsequent suppression of ERN1-mediated pro-apoptotic signaling. While beneficial for host
defense in health, apoptosis suppression could be detrimental in LUAD. We hypothesize that MUC5AC and
MUC5B promote epithelial cell growth in LUAD via ERN2-dependent suppression of ER stress-induced
apoptosis. The following three Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Test the hypothesis that MUC5AC/Muc5ac and
MUC5B/Muc5b promote LUAD and mucinous LUAD; 2) Test the hypothesis that polymeric mucin expression
in tumor cells promotes LUAD via ERN2/Ern2 dependent proteostasis dysfunction; 3) Test the hypothesis that
polymeric mucin expression promotes ERN2/Ern2-dependent epithelial growth. Studies will utilize novel
mouse models, cell lines, and patient samples to focus on significant causative links between mucins, ER
stress, and LUAD. Innovative gene-editing tools will be used along with pharmacologic agents as
interventions, and state of the art animal, tissue, and molecular imaging techniques will be applied.
Completion of these aims has the potential to significantly impact the lives of veterans and their families. Our
team comprises experts in mucin and cancer cell biology who are uniquely positioned to address questions
that will improve our understanding of KRAS-induced LUAD. Findings could identify MUC5AC, MUC5B, and
ERN2 as targets to directly limit LUAD growth and to improve strategies for this common but poorly treatable
form of lung cancer."
10878118,"ABSTRACT
Aging is a risk factor for many chronic conditions including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s disease
related dementias (ADRD) and impacts patient outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Aging can be
chronologic aging (time since birth) or biological aging that may differ substantially from chronological age for
some individuals, putting them at increased risk (accelerated biological aging) or decreased risk (decelerated
biological aging) for age related conditions including AD and ADRD and poorer recovery from TBI. Epigenetic
age measured using DNA methylation and epigenetic clock computations is one way to quantify biological age.
Another risk factor besides age for ADRD is TBI particularly severe TBI. In our preliminary work we have
developed epigenetic clock based biological age and calculated epigenetic age acceleration from DNA
extracted from serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples during the acute phase following severe TBI. Our
preliminary work has implicated epigenetic clock based biological age and epigenetic age acceleration during
the acute phase post injury in patient outcomes at 6, 12, and 24 months after severe TBI. We also have
evidence that social deprivation may impact epigenetic age acceleration in patients who have suffered a
severe TBI. Additionally, DNA methylation of the BDNF gene from serial CSF samples could be a biomarker
for patient outcomes after severe TBI, but the role of this biomarker appears to differ depending on the age of
the patient. This project will expand these investigations in a larger cohort of well-characterized severely
injured individuals with severe TBI. Expected results include finding a link between accelerated epigenetic
aging and variation in patient outcomes up to 2 years after severe TBI and that social determinants of health
impact accelerated epigenetic aging in this patient population. Accelerated epigenetic aging could be a useful
biomarker for prognosticating about a patient’s acute and chronic outcomes as well as guiding and monitoring
treatment during the acute and chronic phases after TBI. Knowledge that accelerated epigenetic aging impacts
patient outcomes after severe TBI, and identifying what influences accelerated epigenetic aging in this
population, could also inform treatment developments. Harnessing this knowledge could be beneficial to
patients who have sustained a severe TBI. Knowing that TBI is a risk factor for AD/ADRD, caring for the
severely injured brain with evidence-based interventions could also help mitigate long term sequela after TBI
that includes mitigating risk for AD/ADRD."

The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is generating a vast multi-omic, multi-
tissue, multi-species dataset. With these data, the Consortium will better understand the molecular effects of
exercise. Managing and analyzing this multidimensional dataset present significant bioinformatics and data
management challenges and opportunities. The MoTrPAC Bioinformatics Center (BIC) at Stanford has been
actively working to address these challenges and develop solutions that will scale well beyond the scope of the
MoTrPAC project. Successes include developing clear data standards, cloud-based data pipelines, and
integrations with external bioinformatics resources. The BIC adopts a dual approach, simultaneously creating &
sharing innovative tools to enhance data usability, while also supporting the Consortium's critical tasks. For the
next phase of MoTrPAC, we propose three specific aims. Aim 1 expands the BIC’s data management and
processing framework, enhancing the existing system for efficient data management and processing. This
includes ongoing development of cloud-based pipelines, ensuring quality control and data integrity, expanding
the data management system for secure storage and seamless sharing, and adhering to FAIR principles
(Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Re-use). These efforts will improve research efficiency,
reproducibility, and collaboration within the Consortium, as well as provide novel bioinformatics tools to the
wider scientific community. Aim 2 builds on previous expertise to advance methods for analyzing multi-omic,
multi-tissue, and cross-species data. We will facilitate integrated analysis using best practices across various
analytic stages, including quality control, differential expression analysis, and multi-omic integration across
tissues and clinical data. Additionally, we will develop cloud-based tools and infrastructure for sharing analysis
techniques within the Consortium and with the scientific community. These approaches will uncover not only
scientific insights but also a reproducible framework for multi-omic data analysis. Aim 3 seeks to disseminate
MoTrPAC data widely through multiple resources and external integrations. We will maximize the usability of
the MoTrPAC data resource for the scientific community. We will continually improve motrpac-datahub.org,
integrating tools for data queries and visualization, and share data and metadata with both external
repositories and the NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE). Alongside these efforts, outreach, training,
documentation, workshops, and tutorials will be provided to enhance user engagement. These approaches will
ensure broad accessibility and long-term usability of MoTrPAC data. With our established expertise,
experience, and tools, the BIC is well-prepared to continue serving the Consortium and fulfill the vision of
MoTrPAC, to uncover the molecular underpinnings of the health benefits of exercise."

10889060,"PROJECT SUMMARY (H-MARC)
There is growing evidence for the importance of environmental factors, such as the microbiome, playing a critical
role in the pathogenesis of digestive, liver and pancreatic diseases. A detailed characterization of the
microbiome is critical to identify novel biomarkers relevant for precision medicine and to monitor the modification
of the human microbiome as a modality to prevent and/or treat diseases. To facilitate research focused on host-
microbial interactions and their relevance to digestive, liver and pancreatic diseases, the Center for Molecular
Studies in Digestive and Liver Diseases (CMSDLD) has developed a Host-Microbial Analytic and Repository
Core (H-MARC) with the following two Specific Aims: (1) To provide critical analytic services to characterize
analytes (i.e. genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics) in both microbes and their mammalian hosts, and (2) to
provide expertise that will allow CMSDLD members to extend pre-clinical in vitro and animal model research into
the human clinical domain. In Specific Aim 1, to support the analysis of the mammalian host, H-MARC will
provide access to high-end instruments designed to quantify gene expression at the mRNA and protein levels
as well as access to FACS for the characterization of mammalian cell populations. Genomic analysis will be
provided via Penn’s Next Gen Sequencing Core. To support the analysis of microbiota, H-MARC supports
experiments involving microbial cultures as well as the analysis of metabolites via metabolomics. To meet the
growing needs of the Center membership, the culture facilities have been expanded and a new partnership has
been established with the Penn Metabolomics core to expand the range of analytic technologies to include
additional metabolites for quantification. In Specific Aim 2, H-MARC supports human subject research through
a robust Human Biospecimen Repository via a university sponsored LabVantage-based LIMS system.
Annotated clinical data for IBD phenotyping is recorded in a RedCap electronic database that can be mined
through services provided by the Human Subject Research Support services in the new Biomedical Data
Sciences Core (BDSC). In sum, H-MARC services are designed to facilitate integrated analyses of host-microbial
interactions at the preclinical and clinical interface."
10889062,"PROJECT SUMMARY (MPIC)
The Molecular Pathology and Imaging Core (MPIC) is a unique entity at the University of Pennsylvania and
provides tremendous service, resources, expertise, and efficiency for investigators of the Center for Molecular
Studies in Digestive and Liver Diseases (CMSDLD). MPIC has specific expertise in the processing and analysis
of all tissues and cells, including gastrointestinal organoids, that are relevant to CMSDLD investigators and
houses specialized microscopes, reagents, and equipment essential for the research of CMSDLD investigators;
no resource with similar expertise exists on the Penn campus or in nearby institutions. In addition, by providing
cost-effective approaches, MPIC is particularly beneficial to Pilot and Feasibility awardees, who receive
subsidies for MPIC services, and junior investigators/Associate Members, many of whom do not yet have
independent funding. Established in 1995 as part of a Program Project grant, MPIC expanded in 1997 to serve
CMSDLD investigators and, since its inception, has been heavily utilized and extremely successful, serving as
a model core facility for numerous other Centers and Program Projects at the University of Pennsylvania and
throughout the country. MPIC is a key component of the CMSDLD, providing essential, routine services as well
as cutting edge technologies to CMSDLD investigators. Currently comprising more than 1,000 square feet on
the 9th floor of BRBII/III, MPIC is led by an experienced Director, a highly-trained Technical Director, and skilled
and knowledgeable staff. By integrating with the other CMSDLD Cores, as well as other cores and resources
on campus such as Next-Generation Sequencing Core and central Tier 1 Microscopy Core of the Perelman
School of Medicine and the expert pathologists of the Comparative Pathology Core at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, MPIC dramatically expands the services available to CMSDLD
investigators. Notably, since the last competitive renewal of this application, MPIC has incorporated and
integrated new services and technologies, including Visium Spatial Transcriptomics and automated RNAscope
on the core’s Leica Bond RXm autostainer. Additionally, MPIC promotes new collaborations and research
directions among its users. Overall, MPIC serves the CMSDLD by pursuing the following two interrelated
Specific Aims: (1) To enhance the efficiency and productivity of CMSDLD investigators by providing specialized
technical resources, services, and expertise in histology, pathology, and histologic imaging of the digestive tract,
liver, and pancreas; and (2) To integrate new technologies that advance research and discovery for studies of
digestive, liver, and pancreatic diseases by both surveying and anticipating the needs of CMSDLD investigators.
As such, MPIC provides exceptional utility, quality, value, experience, service, and commitment to the CMSDLD."
10889064,"PROJECT SUMMARY (GMMC)
The Genetically Modified Mouse Core (GMMC) has been an integral part of the CMSDLD at the Perelman School
of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania since 1997. The GMMC is directed by Dr. Douglas Epstein, PhD,
Professor and Vice Chair, Department of Genetics. Dr. Epstein is an experienced investigator with considerable
expertise in technologies and experimental approaches that center on mouse models of disease, developmental
genetics, and genome editing. An experienced technical team, led by Dr. Jean Richa, provides expertise in a full
range of transgenic technologies, enabling the GMMC to regularly introduce new and improved services. GMMC
services include the generation of genetically altered mice by direct genome editing (CRISPR/Cas9), DNA
microinjection into fertilized oocytes to create transgenic lines, generation of chimeric mice via embryonic stem
cell injection into blastocysts. The GMMC also carries out embryo re-derivation, embryo and sperm
cryopreservation, in vitro fertilization (IVF), and centralized cryopreservation storage. The GMMC uses state-of-
the-art laser conditioning of the zona to facilitate IVF and has intracytoplasmic sperm injection capability on-line
to complement IVF services. Newly developed services during the current funding period include the major
expansion of cryopreservation services with corresponding expansion of the cryopreservation facility, integration
of CRISPR/Cas9 direct genome modifications with a newly established Perelman School of Medicine CRISPR
core, and electroporation of DNA and RNA into embryos to increase throughput and decrease wait time for
GMMC services. In the past 5 years, 32 CMSDLD investigators used GMMC services to generate 167
independent mouse lines (primarily by CRISPR/Cas9 editing) and to store 64 mouse lines (by cryopreservation).
Usage is expected to stay the same, or increase over the next five years. Additional Institutional (non-CMSDLD)
support is provided for equipment maintenance and facility infrastructure upgrades and maintenance. An
extensive network of collaborations exists within the CMSDLD focusing on the use of genetically modified mouse
models of digestive and liver diseases. These joint projects among CMSDLD members highlight the role of the
GMMC not only as an essential technical resource but also as a key hub for collaborative research among
CMSDLD investigators, as exemplified by the numerous joint publications and successful grant applications
arising from mice generated, stored, and/or re-derived by the GMMC."
10889065,"PROJECT SUMMARY (BDSC)
The “Biomedical Data Science Core” (BDSC) was founded on July 1, 2020 in response to growing need for
expertise in advanced biostatistics, bioinformatics and human subject research design to support the expanding
portfolio of human and translational research being conducted by members of the Center for Molecular Studies
in Digestive and Liver Diseases (CMSDLD). BDSC is the Clinical Core for CMSDLD. Prior to this time, some of
the services related to the BDSC were encompassed in the Host-Microbial Analytic and Repository Core (H-
MARC). When these services were initially conceived of as part of the H-MARC, the focus was principally on
analysis of microbiome data. However, the scope of research among CMSDLD members has evolved
dramatically in the last 5-10 years, now including multiple omics domains. These different types of high-
dimensional data require unique analytic approaches. The BDSC has expertise in analyzing each of these data
types, thereby bringing an efficient solution to the diverse needs of the CMSDLD investigators. Additionally, while
the CMSDLD was founded to focus on molecular aspects of digestive and liver diseases as studied
predominantly in small animal models, there has been increased focus on human subject research. The BDSC
provides consultation and research support services for investigators wishing to pursue human subject and
translational research. The evolution from animal models to human subject research is consistent with the overall
goals of the CMSDLD to conduct research with the potential to impact human health along the theme of host-
environmental interactions in digestive and liver disease research from bench to bedside.
The BDSC is directed by Hongzhe Li, PhD, Professor of Biostatistics and co-directed by James D. Lewis, MD,
MSCE, Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology. Together, they bring decades of experience in research related
to gastrointestinal and liver disease, with specific expertise in applied and theoretical biostatistics, and human
subject research design, implementation and education. Moreover, although this is a newly created core within
the CMSDLD, Drs. Li and Lewis have a long track record of collaborating together and with other members of
the CMSDLD.
The core services to be provided by the BDSC include: (i) providing consultative services to support the design
and analysis of clinical and translational research, (ii) supporting the use of clinical and translational research
databases and (iii) providing biostatistics and bioinformatics support including standard and customized
analytics. Together, these services are designed to increase the quality and efficiency of CMSDLD investigators’
research and facilitate the continued evolution of CMSDLD’s focus on translational research."
10889068,"PROJECT SUMMARY (P&F PROGRAM)
The goal of the Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) Program of the University of Pennsylvania DDRCC, the Center for
Molecular Studies in Digestive and Liver Diseases (CMSDLD), is to foster the growth of innovative digestive and
liver diseases and microbiome research throughout the university and its affiliates, leading to exciting and
unexpected new research directions for both junior and experienced scientists and, in turn, bringing these new
ideas to the existing Research Base. The P&F program provides seed funding, subsidized access to state-of-
the art cores, and, when appropriate, mentorship, to enable investigators to pursue new ideas, testing their
feasibility and generating sufficient preliminary data to obtain sustained grant funding by traditional mechanisms.
Over the past 10 years, the CMSDLD has awarded $1,350,019 divided amongst 50 P&F awards. The total return
on investment thus far is 1:15, representing the successful achievement of P&F Program goals. Notably,
awardees have come from three schools at the University of Pennsylvania (Medicine, Veterinary Medicine, and
Engineering and Applied Sciences) as well as the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia; within the School of
Medicine, there are eight departments represented, including both clinical and basic science departments. The
variety of investigator affiliations reflects the scientific diversity of the CMSDLD research base and the expansion
of innovative digestive and liver diseases and microbiome research widely throughout the University.
Building on this history, the overall goal of the P&F Program for the next project period remains to support
growth and innovation in digestive and liver diseases research throughout the University of Pennsylvania
community. We are requesting $120,000 per year, with the goal of annually funding three awards of $40,000.
The Specific Aims for the next project period are: 1) To provide funding for Type 1, 2, and 3 investigators
proposing meritorious and exciting new research in digestive disease, liver disease, and microbiome research,
with a preference for Type 1; and 2) To provide support to awardees through access to core facilities, biostatistics
support, inclusion in CMSDLD enrichment activities, and targeted mentorship and other interactions with
CMSDLD members. The P&F program has had a marked impact on the development of a broad-based,
multidisciplinary, and scientifically diverse community of digestive and liver disease and microbiome researchers
at the University of Pennsylvania. The continuation of this program offers the potential to further develop this
community, bringing in new faculty, ideas, and techniques to digestive and liver diseases and microbiome
research on campus and ultimately having a marked and positive impact on this research nationally."
10889070,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ENRICHMENT PROGRAM)
The goal of the CMSDLD Enrichment Program is to provide unique programming to advance the scientific
education and professional development of digestive and liver disease researchers at all levels, ranging from
undergraduate students to senior professors.
The Enrichment series has been rebuilt over the last two years, with new programs to better target the needs of
the restructured Research Base and Theme Areas as well as to provide expanded career development offerings
for junior researchers. Enrichment activities fall into three categories: 1) scientific programming for the CMSDLD
community as a whole, including a Research Seminar series, regular trainee research update sessions, an
Advances in Technology Series, and an Annual Symposium, highlighting the latest scientific and technical
advances; 2) mentoring and professional development programs, including Grant Writing and Lab Management
Seminar series, regular Mini-Poster Sessions, extensive oral presentation opportunities, and a junior faculty
exchange program; and 3) support for training programs for undergraduates, medical students, graduate
students, and postdoctoral fellows.
Additional goals of the enrichment program are to enhance cohesion in the Center in the setting of changes to
the Research Base, the reorganization of Center themes, and the addition of a new core; and to foster diversity,
equity, and inclusion through both the scientific and professional development programming.
Collectively, these activities will increase the pool of well-trained digestive and liver disease researchers, bolster
the trajectory of scientists interested in digestive and liver disease research, generate scientific excitement, and
provide state-of-the-art technical education to Center participants at all career stages."
10889125,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The Stanford Diabetes Research Center (SDRC) seeks support for its efforts to discover, apply, and
translate scientific knowledge about diabetes, obesity, and metabolism to improve public health by reducing
the burden of disease from diabetes. The Administrative Core coordinates, allocates and oversees resources
and provides oversight to ensure the smooth operation of the SDRC, including the Research Cores, Pilot &
Feasibility Award Program, Regional Pilot & Feasibility Award Program, and Enrichment Program.
Coordination of these activities is facilitated through the maintenance and curation of a Center website. The
Administrative Core includes the Director, the Associate Director, an Administrative Assistant, a Program
Manager, and a Web Administrator. The Director assumes responsibility for the scientific and training
directions of the SDRC. The Associate Director assists the Director as needed in the operation of the SDRC,
and assumes full responsibility for the SDRC when the Director is not present. The Administrative Core aims
include fostering membership in the SDRC to stimulate and ensure the growth and maintenance of the vibrant
research investigator base, guiding the career development of junior investigators in diabetes related research,
enhancing the environment of training, education and knowledge about opportunities in diabetes research at
Stanford, and providing a framework for continuous growth and evolution of resources at Stanford, including
links to local, national and international constituencies, that enhance diabetes related research.
 The SDRC Enrichment Program leverages strengths of Stanford University to enhance diabetes research

speakers, early-stage investigators and trainees, an annual Diabetes Research Day Symposium that
showcases new and evolving ideas, career development through mentoring and SDRC-specific course
offerings, and the spectrum of training grant opportunities including NIH T32 training programs and numerous
patient-oriented events that occur on campus as well as within the community. Together these contribute to
create a vibrant, energized research base with national and international impacts on diabetes research."
10889126,"STANFORD ISLET RESEARCH CORE (SIRC): PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The specialized expertise of the SDRC Islet Research Core (SIRC) provides SDRC investigators with the
capacity to perform modern molecular, cellular and functional studies of high-quality islets and pancreata from
rodents and humans. The SDRC’s large group of collaborative investigators study a broad spectrum of islet
biology in physiological or pathological settings, including islet development, functional maturation,
maintenance of mature cell fate, proliferation, genetics, epigenetics, gene regulation, inter-organ signaling,
intra-islet cell signal transduction, islet immunology, and aging. A central aspect of the SIRC is our direct focus
on parallel studies in rodent and human tissues. An essential component supporting the majority of studies
falling under this paradigm is our ability to isolate high-quality, well characterized rodent or human primary
pancreatic islets, and then to perform assays of islet cellular, molecular and physiological phenotypes. This is
coupled with a reliable, robust program to procure high-quality human islets that have increased the number of
SDRC investigators studying human islet biology. The support of transplantation-based studies of human islet
cell function, growth and fate by the SIRC also enhances potential translational studies of human islets for
diabetes. In addition to these services, the SIRC is committed to training investigators in specialized methods
of islet biology, like islet isolation and transplantation, islet culture and specialized assays including insulin or
glucagon ELISA, islet perifusion and static batch insulin secretion assays, and immunohistology. SIRC
personnel work closely with SDRC investigators to build efficient experimental strategies tailored to their aims.
These islet-focused services or activities would be lost without P30 support of this unique Stanford research
core. The SIRC also serves the Stanford community and the SDRC by continuously developing new
experimental capacity to match the dynamic demands of modern islet investigations. This includes assays of
islet function, new approaches to investigate human islet cell genetics, new models of islet transplantation, and
assistance in developing new clinical islet programs at Stanford Health Care, like the Stanford Pancreatic Islet
Replacement and Immune Tolerance (SPIRIT) clinical islet transplantation programs. The SIRC also enhances
the use of other SDRC Research Cores by integrating activities with those cores. Together with the Diabetes
Immune Monitoring Core (DIMC) and the Diabetes Genomics & Analysis Core (DGAC), the SIRC collaborates
on efforts permitting cellular, genetic, molecular, physiological and genome studies of human pancreas- and
immune or blood cells, including immune, stromal and vascular cells. The SIRC will also serve SDRC
members at University of California (UC) Berkeley or at UC Davis, including those supported through the
proposed Regional Pilot & Feasibility Award expansion. Based on growth of the SDRC membership, evolution
of exciting new services, increasing membership demand for human islets, and the increased research
focused on islet biology in the SDRC, we anticipate growth of demand for SIRC services in the coming years."
10889127,"DIABETES GENOMICS AND ANALYSIS CORE (DGAC): PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The SDRC Diabetes Genomics and Analysis Core (DGAC) supports the genomic research of SDRC
investigators through access to next-generation sequencing and modern bioinformatics analysis. Nucleotide
sequencing has become essential for formulating and resolving crucial biological questions in many contexts,
like diabetes. This includes determining the underlying causes of human diseases to monitoring gene
expression, elucidating regulatory networks and exploring organismal diversity that may impact human health,
like human microbiomes. Researchers use this technology increasingly for an ever-broadening range of
applications to detect and characterize nucleic acid molecules (RNA and DNA). The overall goal of the DGAC
is to provide SDRC investigators with a next-generation sequencing facility composed of state-of-the-art
laboratory, computational facilities and engaged bio-informatics support. The DGAC is committed to providing
SDRC laboratories with the expertise and technical support necessary to realize the potential of next-
generation sequencing in a cost-effective manner regardless of their existing expertise in genomics. This
includes active evolution of core services, like the development of the wildly popular bio-informatics ‘Office
Hours’ and consulting services: thus, the DGAC helps SDRC members from ‘start to finish’ with their
genomics-based experiments. We will continue to offer a complete package of services ranging from study
design consultation, library preparation services, access to sequencing technologies, and analysis and
interpretation of sequencing data. SDRC laboratories can leverage the technologies and expertise of the
DGAC to overcome cost-prohibitive barriers of entry into genomics. Based on the strengths of the DGAC and
its contributions, the specific aims are to provide SDRC core users guidance with design of their next-
generation sequencing projects, access to a broad range of nucleotide library preparation services, access to
sequencing services with modern sequencing technologies, and support with data analysis and interpretation
of their sequencing projects. The proven strengths of the DGAC in these techniques will continue to provide
investigators with a unique opportunity to effectively apply powerful research approaches that would be
prohibitively difficult for individual laboratories to develop. The DGAC serves as an invaluable resource for the
SDRC, providing investigators with the next-generation sequencing expertise and training necessary to
examine the genome at a level of access and subsidized cost for SDRC members that is not achievable at
Stanford without this core. The DGAC will also serve SDRC members at UC Berkeley and UC Davis, including
those supported through the proposed Regional Pilot & Feasibility Award expansion. Based on growth of the
SDRC membership, evolution of exciting new technologies, and increasing membership demand for bio-
informatic support and analysis, we anticipate growth in use of the specialized and unique DGAC services in
the coming years."
10889128,"DIABETES IMMUNE MONITORING CORE (DIMC): PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The specialized expertise of the Diabetes Immune Monitoring Core (DIMC) successfully provides SDRC
investigators with the capacity to perform modern molecular, cellular and functional studies of human immune
cells in type 1 (T1D), type 2 (T2D) and type 3c (T3cD) diabetes. Many SDRC members perform collaborative
studies of immuno-biology in physiological or pathological settings, including transplant tolerance,
inflammation, cell signaling, immune cell metabolism, immunogenic vs non-immunogenic cell death, genetics,
epigenetics, islet immunology and immune therapy. A key feature of the DIMC is our direct focus on human
immunology with the assessment of leukocytes in blood and tissues. An essential component is the provision
of validated and standardized high dimensional instrumentation, reagents and assays to probe B, NK, T,
myeloid and granulocytic cell lineages in blood and tissue from patients with or at-risk for diabetes. These
robust tools have increased the number of SDRC investigators studying human diabetes at Stanford. In
addition, the DIMC has evolved to meet the emerging interests of SDRC investigators by developing human
tissue procurement for immuno-biology studies related to diabetes, including archiving of fractionated blood
cells and serum from subjects with new-onset T1D, and isolation and banking of matched bone
marrow/hematopoietic stem cells in coordination with the SDRC Islet Research Core. These activities are not
provided by any other research core to diabetes researchers at Stanford. The DIMC’s current support also
enhances the emerging Stanford Pancreatic Islet Replacement and Immune Tolerance (SPIRIT) human islet
transplantation program for Stanford Health Care (SHC) patients with T3cD and eventually T1D. The DIMC
also provides training for investigators in specialized methods of human Immunology such as CyTOF, high
dimensional flow cytometry, cytokine/chemokine microbead arrays, mixed lymphocyte reactions, T cell
receptor repertoire analysis via RNASeq and monitoring of B, T and APC responses to ß cells and their
antigens. DIMC personnel will continue to work closely with SDRC investigators to build efficient experimental
strategies tailored to their needs. This support will help investigators develop the new clinical programs at
SHC. Integration of DIMC efforts with other SDRC research cores will continue to enrich and enhance studies
of human immune cells relevant to diabetes. The DIMC evolves to serve the SDRC community by continuously
developing new experimental capacity to match an explosion in sophisticated technologies. The DIMC will also
serve SDRC members at the Universities of California at Berkeley or at Davis, including those supported
through the proposed Regional Pilot & Feasibility Award expansion. Based on growth of the SDRC
membership, evolution of exciting new services, increasing membership demand for human immune and
hematopoietic stem cell studies, and the increased research focus on immune and transplantation biology, we
anticipate increased demand and use of specialized or unique DIMC services in the coming years."
10889129,"DIABETES CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL CORE (DCTC): PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of the Stanford Clinical & Translational Core (CTC) is to facilitate high-impact diabetes research by
SDRC members. At Stanford, pioneers in cutting-edge technologies of diverse science fields are often in
search of clinical collaborators with human subjects to ‘translate’ their findings to the clinic. Similarly, clinical
investigators often fail to innovate based on a lack of awareness or accessibility to improved or novel
methodologies. In addition, teams of scientists and clinicians attempting to translate their work often encounter
hurdles with regulatory processes, sample management, and thoughtful data collection, or analysis
empowered by modern analysis, leading to inefficient use of time, sample loss, failure to complete studies, and
disincentive to provide banked samples for collaborators. The CTC addresses these specific needs by
leveraging existing Stanford resources to focus on diabetes-specific research, thus enhancing our institution’s
ability to perform innovative high-impact interdisciplinary studies that surpass the capabilities of a single
investigator/laboratory. The CTC team is led by directors that are national leaders in their fields of diabetes-
related research, and provides three core services: 1) Advanced support in analytics including study design,
database design with setup of data capture, and linkage to the electronic medical record and biorepository,
data management, and data analysis, and 2) A Bio-repository - unique at Stanford - of prospectively collected
human tissue samples with standardization of collection and sample tracking, and links to clinical data, all
accessible via a centralized hub. 3) The CTC will orient SDRC investigators and their teams and train them to
use each of these core services effectively. In addition, the CTC is well-integrated with the Clinical Trials
Research Unit (CTRU) of the Stanford CTSA-supported “SPECTRUM” programs for clinical and translational
research. This integration improves efficient clinical sample collection and clinical assays for designing studies,
recording data, logging samples, and linking sample results to phenotypic and metabolic data. Thus, institution-
wide support exists for collaborative and “team” science, for modernizing data collection methods, and for
resource sharing. The CTC will continue to leverage expertise in scientific methods and research-support
systems developed on campus but that are underused or not yet tailored to diabetes research. Use of the
CTC by SDRC members will advance the planning, execution and communication of coordinated,
collaborative, and transformative clinical and translational research. The CTC will also serve new SDRC
members at the Universities of California at Berkeley or at Davis, including those supported through the
proposed Regional Pilot & Feasibility Award expansion. Based on growth of the SDRC membership, evolution
of exciting new services like the CTC Bio-repository and increasing membership demand for human tissue and
cell studies, we anticipate growth in use of the specialized and unique CTC services in the coming years."

The goal of the proposed research is to identify the best predictive biomarkers of dementia in Parkinson’s disease
(PDD) through a multimodal and multivariate statistical model utilizing both neuroimaging derived measures
(diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), and T1-weighted MRI measures) and non-
imaging measures such as demographics (age, sex, years of education), clinical (disease duration and severity),
genetics (LRRK2), and CSF-measures (Total Tau, β-Amyloid, α-synuclein). It is critical to identify biomarkers
that can predict dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PD) as approximately 50-80% of PD patients develop PDD
within twelve years of diagnosis. Identifying pathophysiology-based biomarkers that could identify PD patients
at high risk for PDD reliably is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal
stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and better understanding the pathophysiological
processes underlining PDD. The proposed project has two important components. The first component of the
project is to understand the pathophysiological mechanism underlying PDD through sophisticated voxelwise
dMRI-derived measures estimated using a multi-shell high angular and spatial resolution dMRI data acquisition,
and understanding network-level white matter (WM)-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional
connectivity in PDD. The second component of the project is to identify the biomarkers that predict PDD through
multivariate statistical modelling by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging
measures with non-imaging measures (such as clinical, demographics, genetics, and CSF-measures). We will
recruit demographically matched healthy controls (HC) along with demographically, disease duration, and
disease severity matched PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), PD-non-MCI (PD-nMCI), and
PDD for this project. We will acquire multi-shell dMRI data at three b-values, namely 500s/mm2, 1000s/mm2, and
2500s/mm2 with a high angular and spatial resolution and estimate various unbiased free-water (fiso) corrected
Gaussian dMRI-derived measures along with non-Gaussian dMRI-derived measures such as diffusion kurtosis
measures, and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging measures. We will further compare these
measures between the groups to identify significant dMRI-derived measures separating the groups, and
understanding the neuroanatomical correlates of these measures with various neuropsychological scores.
Furthermore, we will estimate dMRI-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity to
understand network-level discrepancies predicting PDD. These pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures
will be further combined with various non-imaging measures through a novel machine learning algorithm to
identify the comprehensive and best predictors of PDD. The tools developed in our proposal also has great
potential for significantly advancing the understanding of other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) thereby helping to understand AD- and PD-specific neuroanatomical changes predicting dementia."
10889172,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
There is substantial interest in identifying intricate mechanisms of the morphine-mediated effects and opioid
addiction in order to expand strategies for novel therapies. Although the role of nonspecific thalamus in regulation
of consciousness is well documented, its possible role in the morphine-mediated effects and addiction is not well
studied. Principal Investigator (PI) has recently discovered the role of CaV3.1 isoform of T-type calcium channels
(T-channels) in the central medial nucleus of thalamus (CeM) in neuronal excitability regulation and
thalamocortical oscillations during anesthesia. Furthermore, based on the new exciting preliminary data, the
overarching goal of this proposal is to determine the functional role of CaV3.1 isoform of thalamic T-channels in
the morphine effects and addiction. It is hoped that this may form foundation for novel approaches to treatment
and/or prevention of opioid overuse. In Aim 1, I will use patch-clamp recordings and 2-photon calcium imaging
from acute brain slices ex vivo and projection-specific targeting and manipulating CeM neurons to determine
acute and lasting effects of morphine exposure (after repeated morphine exposure and morphine-induced
conditioned place preference – CPP) on T-channels and excitability of CeM neurons. In Aim 2, I will use
behavioral experiments relevant to the addiction: CPP and self-administartion (SA) models, in vivo viral silencing
technologies (with small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and Cre-specific knocking-out (KO)) and chemogenetic method
for transient behavioral modulation to investigate functional role of thalamic T-channels in addiction.
Completion of these aims will generate new insights into the mechanisms of the morphine effects and opioid
addiction that could identify new treatment options. The PI will receive mentorship and technical training in
addictive behavior and viral technologies by experts in electrophysiology and viral technologies in motivated
behaviors. University of Colorado and the Department of Anesthesiology provide exceptional facilities and
resources for completing the proposed experiments, as well as having an exceptional reputation and record of
accomplishment for mentoring and transitioning early-stage into independent investigators. The proposed
training, education and research will provide the PI with the technical and professional training to become a
successful, independent investigator."
11085908,"Joint pain and stiffness associated with osteoarthritis and synovial fibrosis affects a large population of active
duty military and veterans with an incidence higher than the general public. Despite the prevalence of disease,
there are currently no non-surgical treatments with significant disease-modifying capabilities, and consequently
end stage disease culminates in total knee arthroplasty. The research goal of this proposal is to develop and
test a non-surgical intervention to alleviate joint stiffness and protect the joint’s cartilage surfaces. In synovial
fibrosis, fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation leads to joint stiffening via cell-mediated extracellular matrix
deposition and reorganization. Additionally, this fibrotic differentiation of synovial fibroblasts leads to reduced
lubricant secretion into the synovial fluid. Mechanosensing, or a cell’s interpretation of the mechanical
microenvironment, is a crucial facet of fibrosis development and may potentially pose a therapeutic target. In this
proposal, we will target synovial cell contractility, or how much a cell pulls on its local environment, to introduce
a therapy that can both mitigate fibrotic cell differentiation and restore lubricant expression in joints. We will test
our hypothesis that modulating cellular mechanosensing can inhibit synovial fibrosis using two Aims. In the first
Aim, we will assess how a microsphere-delivered small molecule, fasudil, can inhibit fibrotic behaviors of synovial
fibroblasts collected from total knee arthroplasty patients. In the second Aim, we will assess this treatment using
a rabbit model of synovial fibrosis induced via joint injury and immobilization. This Aim will test two treatment
strategies by introducing the treatment in the incubation periods of disease following injury and also after the
onset of fibrosis at the time of remobilization. Overall, this work has the potential to introduce a new treatment
option for veterans experiencing joint pain and stiffness that can delay the need for surgical intervention."
11086281,"The purpose of the Duke Environmental Analysis Laboratory (DEAL) Hub is to offer a comprehensive suite of
analytical services to support epidemiologists and health researchers conducting studies focusing on the
impact of environmental exposures on human health. This research is vital to understanding the links between
chemical exposures and human health endpoints, knowledge which is essential in mitigating disease risk and
improving quality of life. DEAL will be co-directed by Dr. Heather Stapleton, a trained environmental chemist
and exposure scientist, and Dr. Lee Ferguson, a trained mass spectrometrist and environmental analytical
chemist. Drs. Stapleton and Ferguson each have over 20 years of experience using mass spectrometry to
detect and quantify contaminants in environmental samples and are pioneers in the fields of emerging
contaminants, exposure science, and non-targeted analytical methods. The long-term objectives of the DEAL
Hub are to: 1) provide consultation and advice to environmental health researchers to support human health
studies ; 2) provide comprehensive and state-of-the-art analytical services to supporting environmental health
research; and 3) develop new analytical methods for the quantitation of emerging contaminants of interest to
environmental health community and develop new technologies and tools for characterizing the exposome. To
meet these objectives, DEAL consists of three internal cores. The first is the Environmental Sample Analysis
Core (ESAR) that will support exposomic researchers by providing services for project consultations, sample
preparation, extraction, and quantitative analysis of contaminants in environmental media using three distinct
sample laboratories, the Targeted Organic, Targeted Inorganic, and Untargeted Organic labs. Through these
three Labs, ESAR and DEAL as a whole can provide comprehensive services for a wide variety of analytes
and support a larger breadth of environmental health researchers. Second is the Developmental Core that will
create new analytical methods for the quantitation of emerging contaminants and develop new technologies
and tools for characterizing the exposome. Finally, the Deal Hub will provide administrative management and
coordination with the ESAR and Developmental Cores through the Administrative Core. This Administrative
Core will also serve as the liaison between the DEAL Hub and the broader HHEAR Network, with Dr. Heather
Stapleton as its Director. The intense collaboration of ESAR, Developmental, and Administrative Cores of the
DEAL Hub will facilitate more and higher quality exposomic research that is essential for continued
understanding of risk mitigation and environmental health interventions in at-risk populations."
10871911,"Pre-mRNA splicing is a fundamental process required for the expression of most metazoan genes. Defects in
splicing lead to human genetic disease, and splicing mutations in a number of genes involved in growth control
have been implicated in multiple types of cancer. Insights into the basic mechanisms of pre-mRNA splicing
and splice site recognition are therefore fundamental to understanding regulated gene expression and human
disease. The control of alternative splicing is a highly combinatorial process, where many inputs dictate the
splicing outcome for each exon. A critical feature of these regulatory mechanisms is the specific interaction of
trans-acting splicing factors with cis-acting RNA elements. We use a highly integrated approach to investigate
the molecular mechanisms that regulate pre-mRNA splicing. This includes knockout and knock-in tissue
culture models, reconstitution assays using radioligands, transcriptomics, bioinformatics, kinetics, structure-
function and biochemical techniques. In the next five years, we aim to address several outstanding challenges
in the field, pursuing the following novel research directions. (1) Our demonstration that splicing regulatory
proteins display highly position-dependent activities that negatively or positively influence splice site choice
changed the way we think about the classical splicing activators (SR proteins) and the classical splicing
repressors (hnRNPs). It is now appreciated that the context-dependent activation or repression of U1 snRNP
serves as a gateway to allow the abundant U1 snRNP to fulfill its splicing function and its role to protect the
pre-mRNA from premature degradation. However, it is not understood how splicing regulators achieve
activation or repression of U1snRNP at the 5’ splice site. We aim to dissect the mechanisms of splicing
repression by embracing multi-system approaches and by understanding the role of U1 snRNP conformers in
mediating spliceosomal assembly. (2) Intron retention is an important alternative splicing pathway that has
eluded extensive study. Thus, its regulation is not well-understood. The existence of inefficiently spliced
introns within coding exons (exitrons) further highlights the biological importance of understanding when
introns are removed efficiently and when they are not. We will decipher the rules of efficient intron removal
and investigate the impact of cis-acting elements in this process using synthetic biology approaches. The
argument is that the depth of the sequence variation tested in massively parallel reporter assays is far greater
than the testing landscape that the human genome offers. Here, we will take advantage of our expertise in
experimental molecular biology and bioinformatics. (3) It has become widely appreciated that gene expression
events are highly integrated, with evidence suggesting that most pre-mRNA processing occurs co-
transcriptionally. Defects in any one of these steps has been linked to disease. However, most published
studies evaluate only steady-state levels of gene expression or focus only on a single step. This ignores the
dynamics of gene expression steps that collectively contribute to the generation of proteins from mRNAs.
Thus, it is unclear how the kinetics of RNA processing and mRNA stability translate into an endpoint gene
expression signature. We have established a reliable method to metabolically label nascent RNA, which
allows us to track transcripts from synthesis to degradation. Work in this project will probe how steady state
mRNA levels are established, how the splicing and translation regulator SRSF1 influences mRNA dynamics
and how these processes adjust as a cell undergoes transformation. The goals of our research program are to
obtain a better understanding of exon recognition and alternative splicing. The new mechanistic insights will
be leveraged to improve strategies to therapeutically target this essential gene expression step."
10871826,"SUMMARY
Older Veterans have a higher burden of comorbid chronic diseases compared to the general population, resulting
in more frequent inpatient hospitalizations. A consequence of frequent and recurring hospitalizations is the
acceleration of age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength (sarcopenia). The combined effect of
sarcopenia and hospitalization exacerbates muscle dysfunction since older adults do not adequately recover
from bedrest placing them on an accelerated trajectory toward loss of independence. Therefore, the period
around hospitalization is a critical period to intervene to prevent disability, loss of independence, and frailty in
Veterans. It is not clear why skeletal muscle in older individuals is resistant to regrowth after a period of atrophy.
Further, current strategies to enhance regrowth in older skeletal muscle remain largely ineffective. The proposed
work is significant because it provides evidence that mTOR activation is the cause, not the solution, to the failure
to recover muscle after disuse. The current proposal is innovative in that it goes against current therapies that
were based on data from young animals; it proposes three independent but overlapping mechanisms; and it
uses sophisticated combined isotope labeling and proteomic approaches to study the periods around disuse
atrophy. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that that chronically activated mTOR in aged skeletal muscle
impairs the recovery of muscle mass/function after a period of disuse. To test this overall hypothesis, we will use
old (28 mo) F344/BN rats with and without an mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin (Rapa)) to address three specific aims
that determine if inhibiting chronic mTOR activity in older muscle: 1) corrects the mitochondrial dysfunction that
impairs muscle recovery after a period of HU, 2) improves the proteostatic stress that impairs muscle recovery
after a period of HU, and 3) helps resolve fibrosis that impairs muscle recovery after a period of HU. Our
hypotheses are that suppression of chronically active mTOR activity will: 1) increase the selective translation of
mRNA to improve mitochondrial protein remodeling, improve the deterioration of network connectivity, and
improve mitochondrial function, 2) improve proteostatic maintenance during RE, and 3) reduce muscle fibrosis
to improve mechanotransduction during RE. For these specific aims we will use our innovative targeted and
discovery-based kinetic proteomics along with novel (e.g. mitochondrial imaging) and well-established
secondary outcomes, including functional outcomes, to support our proteomic outcomes. It is hoped that these
experiments will clarify the underlying cause of failed recovery in muscle of older Veterans, and whether we
should fundamentally change the approach to enhance recovery after disuse in aged muscle. This knowledge
could help prevent the accelerated progression to a disability threshold for a significant number of older Veterans."
10871827,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Today, persons living with HIV (PLWH) face a disproportionate burden of chronic respiratory disease and
accelerated lung aging. Despite advances in research that have increased our understanding of lung disease
among PLWH, there are significant gaps in our knowledge of factors that impact lung health in this at-risk
population. Worldwide ambient air pollution remains a significant, but modifiable, contributor to chronic
respiratory morbidity and disease development. While translational studies suggest that HIV increases
susceptibility to cigarette smoke, whether this applies to long-term ambient air pollution exposure has not been
studied. To date, the impact of long-term air pollution exposure on lung aging in HIV remains unknown. The
Study of HIV Infection in the Etiology of Lung Disease (SHIELD), a prospective cohort of 2600 individuals with
or at-risk for HIV in Baltimore, MD, provides an ideal platform to efficiently answer questions about the impact of
the environment on lung aging for PLWH. Building on the existing SHIELD cohort, we aim to determine if
long-term ambient air pollution is a driver of accelerated lung aging in a high-risk population, and if
PLWH are more susceptible to the respiratory health effects of pollutant exposure.
The proposed research will uniquely characterize the interaction between the environment, HIV, and lung aging.
We will add refined measures of long-term ambient air pollution with enhanced precision, in-depth CT
phenotyping to capture early lung disease, and molecular markers of biologic aging and susceptibility to
exposures, while leveraging longitudinal lung function data from a well-defined cohort of PLWH. We propose
three aims to study the impact of long-term exposures on multidimensional (physiologic, radiographic, and
biologic) lung aging among PLWH. (Aim 1) To determine the association between long-term ambient pollutant
exposure and physiologic lung aging (trajectory of lung function decline) and health related quality of life for
PLWH and comparable HIV-uninfected participants; (Aim 2) To define the impact of long-term pollutant exposure
on CT measures of radiographic lung aging (small airways disease, air trapping, emphysema) among PLWH;
(Aim 3) To determine the association between long-term pollutant exposure and accelerated “biologic” aging,
measured via the epigenetic clock, a molecular marker of biologic responses and susceptibility to pollutant
exposure. In all aims we will examine how HIV and markers of HIV control increase susceptibility to air pollution.
This proposal will provide mentored training in the implementation of an environmental cohort study, the
complexities of HIV-lung disease research, advanced biostatical methods, novel CT analysis techniques for lung
phenotyping, and the application of epigenetic markers to describe biologic responses and susceptibility to
exposures. The career development plan includes expert mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on
experience to facilitate Dr. Raju in achieving his career goal of becoming an independent physician scientist with
expertise at the intersection of environmental health disparities, HIV, and lung health research."
10871794,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprised of Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative colitis, is a chronic relapsing
disorder that affects 1.4 million Americans including an estimated 600 per 100,000 veterans causing
malabsorption, bloody diarrhea, strictures, fistulas, and infection. In addition, the chronic inflammatory state
increases the risk for colorectal cancer with poorer prognosis and reduced survival rates compared to non-IBD
patients. Immunotherapy is increasingly effective; however, refractory disease and relapse are not well
understood. My long-term goal is to apply my expertise in epithelial cell biology to understand how the
intestinal epithelium forms an effective barrier against microbes. The goal of this proposal is to understand how
the microscopic surface architecture of the gut is disrupted in and contributes to IBD pathogenesis and
bacterial infection. The epithelial cells lining the intestine are positioned at the interface of the intestinal
microbes and the gut-associated immune system. Enterocytes are the most abundant cell type and are coated
with ~2000 small hair-like protrusions, microvilli (MV) that facilitate nutrient absorption and serve as a
protective barrier from the millions of bacteria concentrated inside the gut. MV are the initial site of contact
between intestinal epithelial cells and luminal bacteria. Perturbations in MV structure and density result in
nutrient malabsorption and osmotic diarrhea as seen in IBD and infection with pathogenic bacteria. A recent
study showed that even in uninflamed tissue, patients with Crohn’s disease have lower levels of MV structural
proteins. These findings imply MV defects are not only present in IBD during active inflammation but persist
despite therapy and may contribute to relapse. Interestingly, our preliminary data show that mice lacking the
MV structural protein CDHR2 recapitulate several of the epithelial defects seen in Crohn’s patients, providing a
unique in vivo model system. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that defects in normal enterocyte
apical surface structure and function persist in the absence of active inflammation and provide a path for
microbial entry driving inflammation, infection, and disease relapse. In Aim 1, we will use Crohn’s patient
biopsy tissue and patient stem cell-derived intestinal enteroids to characterize the fundamental ultrastructural
defects present in Crohn’s disease. In Aim 2, we will challenge CDHR2 intestinal knockout mice and Crohn’s
patient stem cell-derived intestinal enteroids with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Enterococcus faecalis
infection to assess the functional consequences of defective MV structure on defense against bacterial
infection/colonization, susceptibility to colitis, and healing in response to inflammation. By the completion of
these studies, we will have identified defects in enterocyte structure in Crohn’s patients and characterized how
these defects contribute to persistent changes in the microbial content. These epithelial structural defects may
provide a new target for therapeutic intervention. Finally, through these studies, a promising young physician
scientist will gain new skills in basic and translational studies of intestinal inflammation and bacterial infection
under the guidance of a highly accomplished mentorship committee of experts in epithelial biology, host-
microbe interactions, and inflammation. These new mentored skills will form the foundation for this junior
investigator to achieve a long-term goal to be an independently funded academic physician scientist."

The current opioid crisis is a major public health problem, and it persists despite the availability of Food and
Drug Administration–approved treatments (methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone). A critical challenge is
the occurrence of lapses or relapses in treated patients, especially given that relapses carry a risk of overdose.
Therefore, there is an unmet need to advance novel alternative interventions that may overcome limitations of
currently available treatment options for opioid use disorders (OUDs). The reason for the limited success of
treatments for OUDs are complex and multifactorial. One potential limitation could be attributed to classical
animal model of OUDs which rarely incorporate social factors. We recently developed an operant rat model of
choice between heroin and social interaction and showed that: (1) rats strongly prefer operant social interaction
over heroin, and (2) social choice-induced abstinence (voluntary abstinence) prevents heroin seeking over time
(in a model of drug craving). The genetic and circuit mechanisms mediating the protective effect of social
reward on heroin craving are unknown. The overarching goal of this proposal is to study the genomic profiling
contributing to the buffering effect of social interaction on heroin craving. We will focus on the central nucleus
of the amygdala (CeA) and its projections based on our findings on the role of CeA in incubation of
psychostimulant craving after social choice-induced voluntary abstinence and previous studies on its role in
incubation of drug craving after forced abstinence across drug classes. In Aim 1, we will generate single-
nucleus RNA-seq from CeA and its projections (using anterograde transynaptic viruses) in rats during the
incubation’s tests after either social-based voluntary or forced abstinence. Additionally. we will interpret the
transcriptomic data within detailed ontologies of transcriptomic cell types in each brain region from the BRAIN
Initiative Cell Census Network, as well as with snRNA-seq of post-mortem amygdala and insula of human
donors with opioid use disorder from the Single-Cell Opioid Responses in the Context of HIV (SCORCH)
consortium. In Aim 2, we will use retrograde adeno-associated viruses to label CeA projection neuron nuclei
and integrate the transcriptomic data with complementary transcriptomic datasets from large consortia. In Aim
3, we will combine our translationally relevant social choice animal model with advanced CRISPRa and
CRISPRi AAV tools to manipulate transcription of key hub genes in either CeA or projection regions to
demonstrate their causal role on social-based protection of heroin craving. Our proposal will provide new
insights into genomic profiling and its mechanisms underlying the protective effect of social reward on heroin
craving in a novel social-based rat model. These results will improve our mechanistic understanding of the role
of social interaction in OUDs."
10871879,"This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused on gut fungal commensal ecology, the mycobiome, in the neonatal period to advance mechanistic understanding of the gut-lung axis in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This research development plan is designed to provide the candidate, an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and neonatologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, with the mentorship, training and research experience required to accelerate his development into an independent clinician scientist in neonatal mucosal immunology. To achieve the candidate’s long-term goal of leading a productive translational research program focused on understanding mucosal immunology in BPD and facilitate his transition to independence, the candidate and his established mentors have devised a comprehensive development plan based on: 1) intensive, personal mentorship from a team with a proven history of productive mentoring; 2) in-depth experiential and focused didactic training to advance his understanding of molecular mycology, gnotobiotics and clinical research methods; and 3) an innovative research plan to produce causal evidence for gut mycobiome involvement in BPD development. The candidate’s research development plan outlines a focused path to obtain the knowledge, skills and experience required to accelerate his development into an independent clinician scientist who will have a lasting impact on neonatal mucosal immunology.

BPD is the most serious pulmonary complication of preterm birth. Treatments to modify developmental risk factors for BPD are lacking. Neonatal models of the gut-lung axis in other lung diseases, epidemiological studies linking antibiotic exposure with increased risk of BPD development, and the candidate’s extensive preliminary studies in mice and preterm newborns strongly suggest the gut mycobiome represents a therapeutic target to influence BPD development. This proposal builds on the candidate’s prior experience and the expertise of his mentors to explore the mechanisms of the neonatal gut-lung axis. We will test two hypotheses. 1) Prenatal antibiotic exposure-induced mycobiome changes drive increased BPD severity by disrupting the gut-lung axis. 2) Colonization with commensal fungi favorably alters the pulmonary mucosal immune response to hyperoxia. Determining if disruption of intestinal commensal microbial communities contributes to the development of lung injury in BPD will inform the development of therapeutics for mitigating BPD. These studies are expected to lay the groundwork translational studies in human preterm newborns."

The AAV BRAIN Safe and Effective Neuromodulator and Sensor Utilization across Species (SENSUS, led by
Caltech) of the NIH BRAIN Initiative Armamentarium Project will develop, validate, and disseminate integrated
(capsid and genome) engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV) tools to monitor and manipulate molecularly
defined neuronal cell types across vertebrate species. To broaden access to these reagents within the
neuroscientific community, we propose a close partnership between the AAV BRAIN SENSUS and California
State Polytechnic University, Pomona (CPP), which will host a new Armamentarium Vector Core (ArmVC). This
collaboration will also increase access to the research community itself for underrepresented minorities (URM)
and minority-serving institutions (MSI), as CPP is a designated Hispanic-Serving Institution that also serves large
populations of Pell-eligible, first-generation, and African American students. This partnership will foster close
interfacing between experts in AAV engineering for neuroscience (PI Gradinaru), AAV production innovations
and dissemination (PI Miles), and URM undergraduate research and mentoring (Co-I Steele) to build the physical
and human infrastructure for AAV production, validation, and dissemination at CPP while comprehensively
integrating MSI undergraduates.
 Caltech’s CLOVER Center (directed by PI Miles) will utilize their experience in running a successful AAV
dissemination center to work with Co-I Steele and Damien Wolfe, M.S., a CPP and Steele lab alum and CLOVER
technician who will work at ArmVC, to establish robust AAV production and dissemination capabilities in the
ArmVC at CPP (Aim 1). CLOVER and ArmVC will cooperatively run a new AAV BRAIN SENSUS Program for
Inclusive Research Experience (ASPIRE) wherein CPP undergraduate students chosen as ASPIRE Scientists
will produce validated AAV for dissemination to the neuroscience community as part of the new ArmVC (Aim 2)
and work in Co-I Steele’s lab to independently validate, using immunohistochemistry, the novel AAV identified
via high-throughput methods in PI Gradinaru’s lab (Aim 3). ASPIRE Scientists will benefit from activities including
workshops, poster presentations, research seminars, and career-focused mentoring meetings with PI Gradinaru
at CPP and Caltech.
 Yearly training (and re-training of returning staff and undergraduates) in AAV production by CLOVER
staff will ensure that methodological advances in AAV production, purification, and characterization developed
or adopted by the CLOVER center are quickly transferred between sites. ArmVC offerings will be publicized and
disseminated through a stand-alone website while also being integrated into AAV BRAIN SENSUS electronic
resources for seamless reagent cataloguing and feedback. With strong quality control and quality assurance
processes in place and overseen by CLOVER, the ArmVC at CPP will broaden access to modern neuroscientific
tools and help bridge the gap in URM career progression in research science."
10871795,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Currently, 34.2 million US adults, or approximately 10.3% of the total population, have diabetes. The
prevalence of diabetes is two-fold higher among Veterans (20.5%) and it is the leading cause of kidney failure,
lower-limb amputations, and adult-onset blindness both in Veterans and the general population. Over the last
two decades, multiple metabolic studies have demonstrated that bile acids play an unexpected but important
role in glucose homeostasis and metabolic syndrome. Correlational 16S and metagenomic studies suggest that
gut microflora can affect host glucose homeostasis through modification of bile acids. The overall goal of this
proposal is to determine the mechanisms by which the gut microflora affect host glucose homeostasis. To have
a better functional understanding of this relationship, investigators need to assess the role of specific bacterial
bile acid biotransformations and investigate their effects on the gut luminal ecology, the flux of metabolites and
nutrients, and ultimately, physiology in conventionally-raised (as opposed to microbiome-depleted) hosts. Thus,
there is a critical need for a tool that will facilitate knocking-in of specific bacterial functions into the gut
microbiome and investigate their effects on the host glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.
 The investigators demonstrate an innovative strategy that addresses this need using engineered native
bacteria. This novel approach allows quick and effective knocking-in of a beneficial function into the gut
microbiome. The function is sustained, potentially for perpetuity, in conventionally-raised hosts with a single
treatment and without the need for microbiome depletion. To date, the investigators have demonstrated that
tractable native bacteria can be engineered to modify bile acids ex vivo, reintroduced to the host, engraft the
entire gut, deliver an intended beneficial function, alter luminal and serum metabolites as intended, affect host
metabolism, and even reverse disease. These functions affect host physiology and potentially alleviate disease.
Using this new approach, the investigators will pursue the overall goal by addressing the central hypothesis that
gut microbiome affects host insulin sensitivity through bile acid deconjugation and that these functions can be
used to treat type 2 diabetes.
 In the next four years, the investigators will pursue the proposal's central hypothesis with three specific aims.
The first aim will determine if bacterial bile acid deconjugation affects ileal and hepatic glucoregulatory transcripts
in conventionally-raised C57Bl6 mice. Ultimately this aim will determine the relationship between bacterial bile
acid modification and host bile acid signaling, gluconeogenesis, and incretin production. The second aim will
determine if the glucoregulatory effects of microbial bile acid deconjugation are mediated by the farnesoid X
receptor (FXR), a major bile acid receptor. This will be done using engineered native bacteria with and without
BSH in FXR knockout mice. In the end, this aim will determine the importance of the role of FXR in mediating
the metabolic effects of gut microbiome. The third aim will determine how diet affects the bacterial bile acid
deconjugation influence on the host metabolic homeostasis, using both the diet-induced obesity model (which
uses a high-fat diet) and ob/ob mice (which uses normal chow diet). Because bile acid signaling is heavily
influenced by diet, this aim will further elucidate the relationship between bacterial bile acid modifications, nutrient
intake, and host glucoregulatory response.
 The expected outcome of these studies is a better understanding of a) how the gut microbiome affects host
glucose regulation and b) whether the gut microbiome can be manipulated to improve insulin sensitivity. The
outcome will have a positive translational impact because it will lead to novel therapeutic targets to T2D using
the signaling pathways and functions employed by the gut microbiome."
10871801,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The recent CANTOS Trial has proved that anti-infammation therapy targeting the interleukin-1β lowers the
incidence of cardiovascular events. However, we lack therapies that can limit the inflammatory injury triggered
by acute ischemia, even though it clearly links to worse clinical outcomes. A critical gap of knowledge in
understanding danger recognition, especially intracellular danger recognition, plays a significant role, because
detecting danger dictates the scope of inflammation. Our long-term goal is to develop immune modulators that
modify danger recognition to contain inflammation-mediated injury. The overall objective of this proposal is to
determine how DNA and its cytosolic receptor the cyclic GAMP synthase (cGAS) propagate injury triggered by
ischemia. The damaged myocardium is enriched with both mitochondrial (thousands of copies per
cardiomyocyte) and nuclear DNA. The large amount of DNA poses a serious threat to myocardial repair when
macrophages, the professional phagocytes, detect it and respond with the robust inflammatory responses
intended to get rid of pathogens from the evolutionary standpoint. The central hypothesis of this project is that
recognition of DNA by cGAS sustains the inflammatory macrophages via activation of the type I interferon (IFN)
pathway that promotes AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) inflammasone; as a result, cGAS is crucial in ischemia-induced
remodeling. This hypothesis has been formulated on the preliminary data and the recently published work from the
applicants’ laboratory. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the intracellular immunity in
ischemic-triggered inflammation has the potential to discover effective ways of limiting inflammation-related injury.
Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1)
Determine that cGAS activation in macrophages drives pathological remodeling and HF; 2) Determine
that cGAS-mediated signaling activates the AIM2 inflammasome pathway. cGAS activates type 1 interferon-
mediated signaling that governs the expression of the guanylate binding proteins (GBPs). GBPs destabilize
the phagosome and cause the release of DNA into the cytosol and triggers AIM2 inflammasome activation; 3)
Identify effective approaches for inhibition of the cGAS pathway to reduce remodeling and HF after ischemic
injury. Aim 1 will be addressed using a cGASf/f mouse line to determine macrophage as the responsible cell type.
Under the second aim, the cGAS-dependent AIM2 inflammasone activation and the essential roles of GBPs
will be examined using loss or gain of function experiments with in vitro and in vivo models. Aim 3 will test
potential protection from immune modulators that inhibit the cGAS-mediated signaling, including two clinically
available agents. The study is conceptually novel by targeting DNA and its cytosolic sensing system,
traditionally viewed as a viral response pathway, in the setting of myocardial ischemia. Knowledge acquired will
vertically advance our understanding of the critical role of intracellular immunity in ischemic injury. As ischemic heart
disease is an enormous burden and often a devastating condition to our veterans, the proposed study moves the field
forward by finding novel strategies alleviating the burden and improve care."
10871802,"Heart failure is an increasingly prevalent problem and particularly so amongst an aging Veterans
population. From a clinical standpoint, the prevalence of comorbid conditions such as obesity, diabetes,
COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), aging and hypertension in these patients has led to the
inflammatory hypothesis where heart failure is also associated with coronary microvascular dysfunction.
Nevertheless, the causal importance of maladaptive substrate metabolism and impaired coronary flow
regulation in the development of the heart failure remain unclear. The work described in this proposal
combines experiments at the basic and translational research level to address the critical need of our
veterans for novel and effective heart failure therapies. The long-term goal of our research is to
understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the role of Sestrin2 (Sesn2), a stress inducible
protein, in mediating progression from compensated left ventricular hypertrophy to decompensated
hypertrophy and maladaptive ventricular remodeling in heart failure. We have demonstrated that Sesn2 is
a mediator of physiologic and pathologic cardiac hypertrophy and are now seeking to define the
underlying molecular mechanisms. Sesn2 knockout (Sesn2 KO) mice display normal cardiac function at
rest compared to wild type (WT) littermates but are vulnerable with pathologic hypertrophy in response to
pressure overload. Furthermore, recently published data from our lab show that Sesn2 serves as an age-
related protein that modulates AMPK, a cardiac energy sensor, to maintain metabolic homeostasis under
stress conditions. Aging related heart failure could be due to impaired Sesn2-AMPK signaling cascade
occurring in synergy with the adverse effects of hypertension. Thus, our central hypothesis is that Sesn2
serves as a scaffold protein that plays a key role in hypertension induced heart failure in aging. Aim 1: To
determine the upstream signaling pathways that control cardiac Sesn2 expression, and the mechanisms
by which Sesn2-mediated AMPK signaling inhibits development of hypertension-induced heart failure in
aging. Aim 2: To determine the role of Sesn2-mTORC1 complex in the cardiac response to hypertension
and aging. Our long-term objective is to improve the care of Veterans with heart failure by developing a
better understanding of the mechanisms leading to heart failure and identifying novel targeted treatments
that can prevent or reverse hypertensive heart failure."

integration between Core E operations and those of the Federal Statistical Research Data Center (FSRDC) at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison during 2015."
10872197,"The importance of analyzing large data sets (e.g., RNAseq, ChIP-seq, genomic studies, etc)
are increasingly used for a global analysis of molecular changes with age or with aging
interventions. However, access to the bioinformatics and statistical expertise necessary to
analyze and interpret these data can be rate-limiting for many investigators, especially junior
investigators. Additionally, in the age of Big Data, there is a need to focus the development of
bioinformatics methods that will help investigators answer aging-related questions. The goal of
the GeroInformatics Core is to assist investigators in Oklahoma City and throughout the nation
with bioinformatics and statistical analyses specifically designed for investigators studying aging
questions. The Core will accomplish this goal using established bioinformatic methods for data
analysis, statistical support for experimental design and analysis, as well as using novel and
innovative approaches for data analysis developed by the GeroInformatics Core, specifically
designed to analyze aging data bases. The GeroInformatics Core consists of established
experts in bioinformatics methods development, statistics, and the molecular biology of aging.
Besides established approaches for data analysis, the GeroInformatics Core has developed
bioinformatics methods to interrogate large-scale data from different perspectives, such as
literature-based networks of related entities (e.g., genes, diseases, metabolites, concepts),
transcriptional correlations compiled from public data sources to compare new experiments
against, and annotations of genomic regions to search for experimental commonalities.
Because of the growing interest in the use of single-cell RNA-sequencing to study the effect of
aging on individual cells from cell cultures or tissues and because of the lack of methods to
critically analyze single-cell transcriptomic data, a new function of the GeroInformatics Core in
this application is to develop methods to iteratively analyze single-cell transcriptomic data and
make these novel analyses available to the aging community."
10872199,"The goal of the Geroscience Redox Biology Core is to provide investigators with a coordinated and
comprehensive evaluation of the molecules, pathways, and systems that contribute to oxidative metabolism and
oxidative stress. These analyses include state of the art accurate and sensitive measures of redox and energy
balance as well as oxidative damage, reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial function. Redox
status and oxidant homeostasis have a major impact on physiologic processes. As a consequence, they
contribute significantly to basic mechanisms of aging as well as a number of age-related diseases, and are key
pathways in geroscience. The Specific Aims for this Core are the following: Specific Aim 1. To perform accurate
and comprehensive analyses of redox status (GSH/GSSG, NADPH/NADP+, NADH/NAD+,), and oxidative stress
and damage markers (lipid peroxidation, e.g., F2-isoprostanes; protein oxidation, e.g., carbonyls; and DNA
oxidation, e.g. 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine). Redox and oxidative damage endpoints are present in limited amounts
and may be unstable. The expertise in the Geroscience Redox Biology Core allows for these analyses to be
performed with the highest possible sensitivity and accuracy. In addition, the analyses the Geroscience Redox
Biology Core provides are especially appropriate for a Research Core because they require costly equipment
and significant technologic expertise that prevents these types of analyses to routine measures in individual
laboratories. Finally, because we are analyzing levels of highly specific biological compounds, our redox and
oxidative damage assays can be applied to tissues or cells from any living organism. Specific Aim 2. To provide
assays of mitochondrial function, energetic status, and reactive oxygen species generation using permeabilized
tissue, isolated mitochondria, and cell culture models. Although these assays require fresh tissue/cells, we have
successfully performed these services for investigators at external sites who can send us small numbers of mice.
Specific Aim 3. To provide in vivo analyses of free radical production, we have expanded the capabilities of the
Geroscience Redox Biology Core in this renewal to include in vivo analyses of redox and energy status, vascular
dysfunction, and tissue structural changes. The Geroscience Redox Biology Core will now provide in vivo redox
analyses of free radical levels and oxygen status using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and immuno-spin
trapping (IST). In addition functional MRI (fMRI), will be used for oxygen status and energy status obtained from
tissue-localized phosphorous (31P)- and hydrogen (1H)-MR spectroscopy.
 Overall, the Geroscience Redox Biology Core will provide a comprehensive panel of endpoint markers of
redox balance and oxidative stress as well as measures of contributing factors such as mitochondrial function
and free radical generation in vitro and in vivo that can impact many aspects of anging and Geroscience."
10872282,"SUMMARY 
An effective and motivated Administrative Core is essential to the Center’s overall success. The Administrative 
Core is responsible for developing a cohesive community of investigators who achieve individual success and 
who also work together to grow and sustain the Center and meet IDeA program goals. In Phase I, the 
Administrative Core led the establishment of the Center and coordinated the mentoring, equipment and 
program support needed for a cohort of junior faculty to launch their independent research programs. 
Throughout Phase I, the Administrative Core conducted extensive evaluation of projects, components and 
overall progress of the Center and made significant refinements to our procedures. Phase II activities build on 
this foundation, by continuing to focus on junior faculty mentoring, adding multiple new approaches to 
strengthen support for faculty, and implementing strategies that increase long-term sustainability of the Center 
as a whole. The Administrative Core’s Phase II activities are thus focused on three main aims: 1) supporting 
success of junior faculty and increase critical mass 2) enhancing capabilities and sustainability of the two 
research Core facilities and 3) providing programmatic leadership and management of the Center. The Core’s 
leadership and oversight committees will continue to provide the overall scientific direction, fiscal management 
and strategic planning for the center. The Core will coordinate activities of multiple oversight committees, and 
be responsible for reporting to NIH program officials and dissemination of results to a range of stakeholders. 
The Administrative Core’s rigorous evaluation and feedback activities will continue to be used to make program 
adjustments to increase the impact and sustainability of the Center. The Administrative Core will manage an 
expanded pilot program and coordinate new partnerships to expand the scientific scope of the Center. 
Finally, the Core will coordinate seminars, training programs, technical workshops and interactions with brain 
injury programs in the community, that are all essential to providing a rich intellectual environment for all 
participants in the Center. Other new activities in Phase II include leadership of capital construction to 
support Center expansion and implementation of state-of-the-art equipment required to advance each 
research Core. The Administrative Core will also launch new initiatives to increase collaboration and 
leveraging of resources between IDeA programs, locally as well as nationally. Achieving these aims will 
provide the foundation for the Center’s goal of a concerted and sustained effort by talented investigators with 
different backgrounds, to work together to develop new interventions for those living with the consequences of 
acute brain injury."

The Preclinical Core supports the mission of the Center for Brain Recovery and Repair by providing well-
validated measures of both structural and functional alterations for investigators utilizing preclinical models of
neurological disorders. The Core is a centralized resource providing intellectual guidance, technical expertise,
training and instrumentation for high quality automated behavioral and structural analyses, broadly applicable
across a range of preclinical models of brain and behavioral illnesses. Through cultivation of new research
programs and collaborative interactions between young investigators and established experts, the Core has
played an essential role in elevating the excellence of brain injury and repair research at UNM. Overall, the goal
of the Core is to leverage our success in Phase I to catapult preclinical research capacity to the critical mass of
funded investigators required to support the Center’s mission of self-sustainability beyond IDeA-level funding.
We will continue to provide the resources and expertise required to support interdisciplinary cutting-edge
research projects of Project Leads in neurophysiological mechanisms of brain recovery and repair, and to
expand our user base of new and established investigators through project development and strategic
investment in state-of-the-art instrumentation, approaches and methodologies. Via the cultivation of innovative
new research programs and increased collaborative interactions between junior investigators and established
scientists the Core will contribute to the sustainability of the Center for Brain Recovery and Repair as a nationally
recognized leader for translational research in brain recovery. Since being established in 2015, the Preclinical
Core has helped advance the field by leading in the development of translational EEG as a platform for assessing
homology of neural activity during behaviors across species. Phase II builds on these successes with the
combination of physiological and behavioral approaches, and adds higher throughput anatomical assessments
to speed studies utilizing sophisticated confocal imaging. Continuing from Phase I, the Core will promote the
Center mission of accelerating the trajectory of Project Leads toward independent NIH-R01 level funding for
Junior Investigators or establishing themselves in the field of brain injury for more senior Investigators. The
Preclinical Core will continue to foster multidisciplinary interactions between clinical and preclinical investigators
at UNM and across the Mountain West. We will also provide a platform for the discovery of novel therapeutic
avenues for brain recovery and repair using preclinical models that will enhance the overall level of excellence
in this vital area of neuroscience research."
10871503,"ABSTRACT
The pathogenesis of postoperative delirium likely involves systemic inflammation, downstream
neuroinflammation, and altered synaptic plasticity reflected by elevations in IL-6 and electroencephalographic
(EEG) slowing. Furthermore, there are no known pharmacologic interventions for preventing postoperative
delirium. Fluvoxamine is an antidepressant that could suppress neuroinflammation through sigma-1 receptor
agonism. Fluvoxamine reduces prostaglandin synthesis and cytokine release from human blood. It is
concentrates in the brain and neuroprotective via sigma-1 receptors. It improves survival in sepsis animal models
and reduces clinical deterioration from COVID-19. Promise in the treatment of delirium is supported by a series
of case reports of fluvoxamine treating delirium in older adults and/or intensive care unit. It is not clear whether
suppressing neuroinflammation is a viable pathway towards mitigating delirium severity. Furthermore, it is
unclear whether fluvoxamine is a feasible pharmacologic intervention for mitigating delirium risk, given societal
stigma against antidepressants as well as side effects of nausea and potential drug-drug interactions. To
evaluate the safety and feasibility of a multisite investigation on perioperative fluvoxamine, we propose
Mitigating Delirium with Fluvoxamine Treatment for Non-Cardiac Surgery (MD FluNCS): Feasibility Trials
& Mechanistic Insights.
This work will enhance our understanding of core pathogenesis of postoperative delirium in a population at risk
for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. With the rise in the aging population, we hope to provide an
intervention to mitigate risk as well as translatable theragnostic biomarkers and approaches for future precision
medicine. The investigation will lay the groundwork for a larger scale Phase 3 trial geared toward advancing
long-term goal of improving public health and quality of life for those at risk of postoperative delirium and related
sequelae."
10871504,"Abstract
An estimated 43 percent of children under age 5 in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) will not reach
their full developmental potential due to poverty, stunting, or inadequate psychosocial stimulation. Parenting
interventions that coach parents on responsive caregiving can effectively improve ECD outcomes in LMICs, at
least in the short-term. However, the very few programs that have examined their sustained effects find that early
program impacts tend to fade over time. To date, the only parenting interventions demonstrating sustained
impacts five or more years after the end of their programs from a LMIC are two small pilot studies, both featuring
weekly individual home visits over two years on a total of 134 stunted or low birthweight children from urban
Kingston, Jamaica. Such intensive delivery models are prohibitively expensive to scale in rural and resource-poor
LMIC settings. Community-based group meetings are a more cost-effective and scalable delivery model, and can
also allowforpeer-to-peer learning and the formation of social support networks. Though growing evidence from
LMICs shows that group meetings are at least as effective as individual home visits to improve ECD in the short-
term, evidence on their ability to sustain impacts over time, and the mechanisms underlying such impacts (e.g.,
social support), is still very limited.
With NICHD support (R01HD090045), we demonstrated that an 8-month, group-based ECD parenting
intervention delivered by CHWs in rural Kenya significantly improved short-term ECD outcomes and
parenting practices, and the program was highly cost-effective. In complementary work (R21HD098508),
immediately after the main intervention, in half of intervention villages, we added 9 bi-monthly “booster”
group meetings to reinforce key messages over two years. In a recent two-year follow-up assessment, we found
that early impacts from the original 8-month intervention were sustained when children were ages 3.5 to 5, and
the poorest families benefited the most. The booster extension, despite being severely disrupted by the COVID-
19 pandemic, had small additive effects on children’s socioemotional outcomes and parenting behaviors.
Building on these results, we now propose to follow-up our original study cohort roughly 5 years after the end
of the intervention to measure longer-term sustained impacts on our sample of targeted children who will be
roughly 6.5 to 8 years old, as well as their younger and older siblings to uncover potential spillover effects. We
will re-enroll households from our original sample across 60 villages to collect an additional survey wave to
measure children’s cognitive, language, executive function and socio-emotional skills, as well as parenting
behaviors, knowledge and beliefs, social networks, and social norms around parenting to examine potential
mediating pathways driving any sustained impacts and any spillover impacts onto siblings.
The goal of our study is to help fill a gap regarding evidence on the long-term effectiveness of ECD programs on
children’s outcomes from a scalable and cost-effective model of delivery to help inform policy."
10872179,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Structural racism is embedded in societal structures that limit opportunities and resources for racialized
groups. This manifest as social determinants of health (SDOH)—the social circumstances in which people are
born, live, and age—and as racial/ethnic health disparities. Professional medical organizations and insurers
recommend screening for—and addressing—adverse SDOH within healthcare delivery. As a result, healthcare
systems especially those serving low-income patients are implementing SDOH screening. Despite this rapid
uptake, critical knowledge gaps remain regarding the equitable implementation and effectiveness of SDOH
screening/referral systems on improving disease outcomes. Our team’s work on the WE CARE SDOH system,
which leverages extant clinical staff and workflows to address families’ social needs, has demonstrated its
effectiveness on increasing referrals to social services and receipt of resources among low-income families;
WE CARE has been cited as an evidence-based SDOH intervention by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
However, our recently completed hybrid effectiveness-implementation RCT found significantly more caregivers
of color (compared to white caregivers) experiencing higher rates of double loss whereby their unmet needs
were not addressed despite being disclosed. These results are likely due to suboptimal implementation related
to multiple levels of discrimination that caregivers of color face in the healthcare and social service systems.
With an interdisciplinary team of SDOH, implementation, antiracism, and practice-based researchers, we will
apply an antiracism lens to WE CARE and develop an implementation toolkit aimed at mitigating
unequal treatment for patients of color. We will conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study with a
stepped wedge cluster RCT design in four large family medicine (FM) clinics that serve racially/ethnically
diverse low-income families from Worcester, Massachusetts. Our specific aims are to: (1) Refine the WE
CARE implementation protocol using an antiracism lens and community engagement approach to: (a)
conduct key informant interviews with families to identify racism-related barriers to SDOH screening/referral;
(b) present these barriers to systems-level stakeholders to elicit input on strategies to address patient
concerns; and create an antiracist-informed toolkit for the implementation of SDOH screening/referral systems;
(2) Implement WE CARE by deploying the refined protocol in FM practices and assess implementation
outcomes including equity, appropriateness, and patient-centeredness; (3) Evaluate the effectiveness of WE
CARE on prevalent pediatric and adult chronic diseases outcomes. This proposal has the potential to create
novel community- and patient-engaged strategies for implementing SDOH screening and referral systems into
healthcare and social service systems with the potential to reduce racial/ethnic health inequities. It is aligned
with the NIMHD’s mission and Healthy People 2030’s overarching goal to “eliminate health disparities.”"
10887965,"Defining the mechanisms that underlie brain development and function are vital for understanding the etiology
of a broad range of neurodevelopmental (NDD) and psychiatric disorders, including autism, attention deficit
disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Despite their distinct diagnoses, many of these disorders display
similar behavioral phenotypes suggesting that transdiagnostic mechanisms may underlie their
pathophysiology. We propose that one such mechanism is the development of the bed nucleus of the stria
terminalis (BNST) via recruitment and activation of microglia by the immune system. The BNST is a complex,
sexually dimorphic region intricately involved with fear and threat assessment, social behaviors, and reward
processing. Notably, all of these behaviors are affected to varying degrees among NDDs and psychiatric
disorders, suggesting that impaired development of the BNST and its neurocircuitry may play a significant role
in their etiology. Despite its small size, the BNST is highly heterogenous, comprising several nuclei and
multiple cell types which participate in both micro- and macrocircuits to modulate behavioral responses to the
environment, including stress. Additionally, the BNST is one of the few brain regions that produces
corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), a neuropeptide that is released in response to stress, as well as
inflammation, two of the highest environmental risk factors for developing NDDs or psychiatric disorders.
Microglia, considered the immune cells of the brain, play a significant role in neurodevelopment, particularly of
sexually dimorphic regions, and are the primary effectors of systemic inflammation in the brain. While
interactions between microglia and T cells, members of the adaptive immune system, have been described
under pathological conditions, mounting evidence suggests they are required for homeostatic function and
maturation of microglia as well. Our prior findings in immune deficient mice indicate that T cells are also
required for normal behavioral responses to stress. Thus, we will determine if the adaptive immune system is
necessary for normal BNST development by comparing immune deficient mice with littermates that received
an adoptive transfer of lymphocytes from wild type mice as neonates. We will also determine if inflammation
during early postnatal development is sufficient to alter BNST development. This proposal has been designed
to utilize a combination of fundamental approaches to investigate the role of the adaptive immune system and
inflammation in BNST neurocircuit development, and will include analysis of microglia, as well as behavior and
circuit analyses. Elucidating whether the immune system recruits microglia to sculpt BNST neurocircuitry will
profoundly shift our understanding of neuroimmune interactions in neurodevelopment and the role of
inflammation in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. These studies will provide the
foundation for future interrogations into the effects on BNST stress neurocircuits, and to evaluate neuroimmune
interactions in specific BNST cell populations and neurocircuits, as well as other brain regions."

The overall goal of this proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is for
the candidate, Dr. Sarah Messmer, to become an independent investigator in implementation science and
substance use disorder treatment, with a focus on opioid use disorder treatment in low-barrier and community-
based settings. Given that opioid overdose deaths have reached an all-time high in the United States, the
development and implementation of evidence-based interventions to treat opioid use disorder is critical. To
become an independent investigator in this area, the candidate requires additional formal training in the
following areas: 1) implementation science in substance use disorder research; 2) clinical trials design; and 3)
ethical considerations in substance use disorder research. The candidate’s mentorship team includes Dr.
Niranjan Karnik, Dr. Sara Becker, Dr. Dennis Watson, and Dr. Rachel Caskey, who will support the candidate
in the proposed training and research plan. The overall objective of the proposed research is to implement an
adapted contingency management program within a mobile low-threshold buprenorphine program.
Contingency management is one of the most effective behavioral health treatments for substance use disorder,
including when provided concurrently with medication for opioid use disorder. However, implementation
barriers have limited its use, particularly in community-based settings. This proposal seeks to engage diverse
stakeholders to identify implementation barriers and develop targeted implementation strategies that can be
utilized for contingency management programs within community-based, low-barrier settings, with a primary
goal of increasing retention in care for patients with opioid use disorder. The proposal will be guided by the
Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) implementation framework, with the ADAPT
process model embedded to guide the stages of adaptation. In Aim 1, the candidate will complete focus groups
and interviews with a group of diverse stakeholders including people who use drugs, community harm
reduction programs, policymakers, researchers, and substance use treatment providers to identify barriers and
facilitators for the intervention. In Aim 2, the candidate will work with an adaptation team of key stakeholders to
adapt a contingency management program and develop an implementation plan for use in a low-barrier mobile
setting. In Aim 3, the candidate will conduct a 12-week pilot study of the adapted contingency management
program and corresponding implementation strategies with patients with opioid use disorder engaged in low-
threshold treatment via mobile van. The outcomes of this study will provide the foundation for an R01 proposal
for a larger clinical trial of the adapted intervention. This award would provide Dr. Messmer with the
mentorship, training, and research experience to become an independent investigator in implementation
science and substance use disorder treatment focused on community-based low-barrier care models."
10867414,"Project Summary: Lipid intrinsic curvature is a fundamental physical feature that regulates membrane
interactions. The goal is to elucidate intrinsic curvature induced effects on the growth of membrane curvature
and packing heterogeneity upon mixing lipids of dissimilar curvature and the consequent distribution of
cholesterol and the neurotoxic 25-35 segment of Aβ peptides in bilayers, using a novel steady state fluorescence
method that utilizes the computed second harmonic (SH) of the zeroth order spectra to better resolve spectral
lines that are not obvious in the zeroth harmonic. The polarity sensitive fluorophore Laurdan will be employed.
Laurdan emission in bilayers is a composite of a line, referred to as blue, from the denser packed region at 432
nm and a red line from the less packed region starting at 440 nm in single component gel phases evolving to
490 nm upon melting or mixing with a higher curvature lipid. This path of structure evolution was a new finding.
The present hypothesis is: Any added molecule of a dissimilar curvature enters the less packed region of the
bilayer. A higher curvature molecule increases stress which is then relieved by growth in flat domains. Laurdan’s
preference for flat regions together with growth in such domains contribute to an increase in Laurdan presence
in flat domains. Fluorescence spectra register an increase in the area, Ab, of the blue line from flat domains and
decrease in the red line area, Ar, along with a red-shift of the red peak and no shift in the blue peak. A lower
curvature molecule decreases stress and the membrane tends toward a homogeneous curvature distribution
resulting in an Ab decrease, Ar increase, blue shift of the red peak and no shift of the blue peak. Enhancement
of heterogeneity in regional curvature due to dissimilarity of intrinsic curvature of mixing lipids and preferential
distribution of cholesterol or Aβ peptide that manifest distinct difference in behaviors of areas and peak positions
are predicted. Laurdan fluorescence spectra will be measured without and with cholesterol or Aβ (25-35) in
mixed bilayers of (i and ii) 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) with (i) 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), and (ii) 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol (POPG)
and (iii) brain lipids. SH of spectra will be computed to determine the number of elementary emissions. Spectra
will be fitted to this number of log-normal functions according to developed methodology to resolve spectral lines.
Area and peak position changes with mixture composition will be examined to determine packing heterogeneity
in the bilayers without the transmembrane molecules and the type of distribution (uniform or non-uniform) of
these molecules. Computing the SH of fluorescence spectra by modulating the wavenumber in analogy to field
modulation in ESR spectroscopy is an innovative approach to bring superior definition to features missed in
broad featureless in measured zeroth harmonics. The proposed research will significantly enhance current
knowledge by elucidating the key role of intrinsic curvature in the mechanism by which the added molecule
enters, accumulates preferentially, inhomogenously rigidifies the bilayer and changes its shape."

10867417,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Hazardous drinking (HD) is among the leading sexual orientation-related health
disparities impacting sexual minority women (SMW; e.g., lesbian, bisexual). Compared to heterosexual
women, SMW are approximately 7 times as likely to report alcohol dependence and over 8 times as likely to
report at least two negative social consequences (e.g., accidents, relationship problems) of alcohol use.
Although minority stress (e.g., internalized homophobia) has been identified as a leading risk factor for HD, it
does not fully explain sexual orientation-related disparities in HD. Adverse childhood experiences, such as
childhood sexual abuse (CSA), have also been identified as risk factors for HD among SMW. Specific
characteristics of CSA, indicative of severity (e.g., relationship to perpetrator, type of CSA), have been found to
increase risk for negative health outcomes, such as HD. However, although SMW more frequently report
having experienced CSA and more severe CSA experiences than heterosexual women, few studies have
examined how minority stress interacts with CSA (and its severity) to exacerbate risk of HD among SMW.
Research in the general population has demonstrated links between CSA and emotion dysregulation and
between emotion dysregulation and alcohol use—and there is an emerging literature showing associations
between minority stress and emotion dysregulation. Therefore, this study will examine the role of emotion
dysregulation, a transdiagnostic risk factor for psychopathology and substance use that impacts the ability to
manage emotional responses. To further clarify the pathway from emotion dysregulation to HD, the mediating
role of drinking expectancies (e.g., forgetting worries) in this relationship will also be examined. Study findings
have the potential to provide important information that can be used to develop more targeted prevention and
intervention strategies to reduce HD in SMW. Using data from a large and diverse sample of SMW in the
Chicago Health and Life Experiences of Women study (N~475), this study has two aims: 1) Examine the
independent and joint associations of CSA (and its severity) and sexual minority stress on HD; and 2) Examine
potential sequential mediation of emotion dysregulation and drinking expectancies in relationships between
CSA and HD, as well between minority stress and HD. In both aims, I will explore differences by sexual identity
and race/ethnicity and identify factors that account for potential disparities. The proposed research and training
are aligned with the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism’s mission and the National Institutes of
Health Notice of Special Interest in Research on the Health of Sexual and Gender Minority Populations (NOT-
MD-19-001) and will help me to achieve the following training goals: 1) Increase knowledge of CSA among
SMW, including severity and SM people’s higher prevalence of CSA; 2) Develop expertise in the etiology and
epidemiology of SMW’s alcohol use and HD; 3) Strengthen statistical and methodological skills to conduct
complex quantitative analyses; and 4) Enhance skills in grant writing, research dissemination, and mentorship."

effective treatments. As a result, mobility difficulties have remained persistently high and stagnant since it was
systematically measured in the late 1980's. Currently, 30% of Americans aged 60-69, 40% of individuals aged
70-79, and 55% of individuals age 80 or older report difficulties with their mobility (e.g. walking and climbing
stairs). To address this unmet need, we propose the Translational Research training on Aging and Mobility
(TRAM) postdoctoral training program to train 4 post-doctoral fellows per year (2 in year one). The overall goal
of the TRAM program is to develop outstanding independent investigators capable of sustaining productive
multi-disciplinary and translational research careers addressing the multi-factorial causes and consequences of
age-related changes in mobility and/or designing multi-modal interventions to prevent and rehabilitate mobility
impairments in older adults. The goals are to: 1) Provide a 2-3 year integrated training program for PhD/MD
fellows to create a career pathway for conducting mechanistic and clinically relevant translational research in
mobility and aging; 2) Implement a cross-fertilized training program based on the Experiential Learning Theory;
3) To equip trainees with new research skills along with the knowledge and expertise to address impactful and
unanswered questions regarding mobility and aging; 4) Closely monitor and track trainee-related experiences
and outcomes for making continuous quality improvements; 5) Create a culture for professional excellence
and development based on enhancing rigor, reproducibility and transparency in trainee-related research and;
6) To attract, recruit and enroll minorities, and those with disabilities and disadvantaged backgrounds. TRAM
program faculty are collaborators on each other's projects, bring strong mentorship experience and successful
commitment to research related to mobility and/or aging. Program faculty are grouped into either Aging or
Mobility Research Clusters based on research focus and expertise. TRAM will use a mosaic mentoring
approach that will employ dual primary mentors— one from “aging” and another from “mobility” expertise— a
third mentor will serve as an advocate/sponsor. Mentees will also receive support from other archetypes like
coaches, connectors and senior peer mentors. This unified mentoring team will guide trainees through an
individual development plan, didactic coursework (e.g. mechanistic and clinical-based research on aging
and/or mobility, ethics, responsible conduct of research), directed research training, and professional
development activities (e.g. strategic planning, innovative leadership) that will be tailored according to the
educational needs and research interests of the trainee. At completion, TRAM fellows will fulfill the scientific
needs and grow the research workforce for meeting the growing population of mobility impaired older adults."

The University of California San Francisco Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (UCSF ADRC) is a major
catalyst for a broad spectrum of research in Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) conducted
at UCSF and has served as a cornerstone for national and international multi-site diagnostic and treatment
studies. In four previous cycles of funding, we have organized a critical mass of AD/ADRD research and share
our resources widely. The central theme of the ADRC is “heterogeneity in dementia,” with a focus on young-
onset and atypical presentations of AD/ADRD in diverse populations. We excel in clinical phenotyping, imaging,
biospecimen analysis, and pathologic characterization of large and unique cohorts of early-onset and atypical
AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum, Traumatic Encephalopathy Syndrome (TES)/Chronic Traumatic
Encephalopathy (CTE), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and functionally intact controls. The ADRC supports
and effectively leverages additional NIH and foundation funding, philanthropy, and industry collaborations to
accomplish its aims. In the past cycle, ADRC resources were utilized by 47 R grants, 18 K awards, six U grants,
two T grants, six non-federal training grants and 59 clinical and industry sponsored trials. In this P30 renewal
application, we accelerate efforts to define subtypes of healthy aging, mild cognitive and behavioral impairments
(MCI/MBI), AD, TES, FTD spectrum and prion diseases, improve early recognition and tracking of transitions
from normal aging to dementia, and stimulate drug development and clinical trials. The ADRC will consist of
seven cores: Administrative, Clinical, Data Management and Statistics (DMS), Pathology, Outreach Recruitment
and Engagement (ORE), Imaging, and Biomarker and a Research Education Component (REC). These cores
will work to pursue the following overarching Specific Aims: Aim 1: Explore the features of brain aging, MCI/MBI,
AD, FTD-spectrum disorders, TES/CTE and CJD to better understand their clinical, genetic, pathological, and
molecular underpinnings via data collected in the Clinical, Path, Biomarker, and Imaging Cores. Aim 2: Promote
innovative research on early and accurate diagnosis, novel treatments, and future prevention of heterogeneous
AD/ADRD by sharing data, images and biosamples from our unique clinical cohorts with local investigators, the
ADRC network (via NACC, SCAN and NCRAD) and the broad research community. Aim 3: Recruit Chinese
Americans, Latino Americans and Black/African Americans to the Clinical Core and offer education to these
communities through the ORE Core. Aim 4: Develop innovative approaches to data management and
biostatistics in the DMS Core to support easy access and analysis of ADRC-related data, while offering statistical
support to our investigators. Aim 5: Train new leaders in research via the REC and educate community
professionals and laypeople through the ORE Core using approaches that highlight the heterogeneity of
AD/ADRD. Aim 6: Enhance diverse perspectives via alliance with local and national organizations, engagement
with community advisory boards, and promotion of diverse and multi-disciplinary ADRC faculty and staff."

The Administrartive Core provides leadership and scientific vision for the ADRC, ensures integration and
synergy across ADRC Cores, regulatory compliance with NIH and university policies, and timely submission of
data and biosamples to NACC, SCAN and NCRAD. The Core guides the scientific direction of the ADRC,
catalyzing clinical and basic research in Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias and promoting National
Alzheimer’s Project Act milestones. The Administrative Core will develop and maintain the overarching
organizational and administrative structure for all the ADRC cores, Developmental Projects, and related
activities under the leadership of Director Gil Rabinovici and Associate Directors Katherine Possin and Howard
Rosen. The Administrative Core will drive and direct the internal integration across all cores, including the
Clinical Core, the Data Management and Statistical Core, the Neuropathology Core, the Outreach Education
and Engagement Core, the Neuroimaging Core, the Biomarker Core, the Research Education Component, and
the three Developmental Projects as they are implemented. Essential activities include promoting and
supporting new and ongoing collaborations critical to advancing research while introducing new trainees and
investigators to the field. The Administrative Core will carefully oversee and follow all applicable regulatory and
fiscal controls. The core serves as the primary liaison between the center and other entities that inform our
research and strategic planning process, including the faculty/staff, Executive, Internal and External Advisory
Committees and Community Advisory Boards. The Administrative Core will work locally to garner institutional
resources while stimulating collaborations across UCSF. A major effort is focused on maintaining an active and
productive engagement with community partners and both national and international collaborators. Key
operational functions include providing communication tools and efficient services for fostering innovative
research, training, reviewing and fulfilling data and resource requests, implementing the ADRC data sharing
plan and policies, coordinating progress, disseminating knowledge, fiscal management, and reporting. The
administrative team will guide strategic planning, program monitoring and evaluations, and responsive

1) design and evaluation of upper limb prosthetic devices; 2) development, evaluation, and deployment of
rehabilitation outcomes measures; 3) study of delivery and effectiveness of rehabilitation services. The
overarching goal of her research is to improve the quality of rehabilitation care for persons with chronic and
disabling conditions. Dr. Resnik has been evaluating prosthetic technology since 2009. She was Principal
Investigator of the VA Study to Optimize the DEKA Arm and led VA efforts to evaluate the DEKA Arm and
transition it to clinical practice. From 2016-2022, she led a national study that compared function, satisfaction,
and quality of life for prosthesis users and non-users, compared outcomes by sex, prosthesis, and terminal
device type. She currently leads a related study that is collecting data to enable more robust comparisons by
prosthesis type and quantify the impact of prosthesis features. She collaborated on the first home trials of a
neural connected sensory prosthesis stud and is site PI for the clinical trial, Peripheral Interfaces in Amputees
for Sensorimotor Integration (Tyler, PI). Dr. Resnik developed and validated three new activity performance
measures for upper limb amputees and developed a briefer version of the Southampton Hand Assessment
(SHAP) measure. She has developed and/or refined numerous self-report measures for use upper limb
amputation care producing: a modified TAPES psychosocial adjustment scale, a prosthesis satisfaction
measure responsive to the concerns of women, a modified PROMIS-UE short form with amputation-specific
calibration, a physical function measure for prosthesis users (UEFS-P), a residual limb health scale, and new
measures of prosthesis experience, prosthesis affordability and prosthesis acceptance Her new VA Merit
Review, Advancing measurement of physical function in upper limb amputation will expand on her work in
measurement of physical function and develop clinical translation tools to facilitate measure adoption. Dr
Resnik also developed measures of Veteran community integration using the conceptual framework of
“participation” as described by the WHO’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, the
Community Reintegration of Injured Service Members (CRIS) and the CRIS-CAT a computer adaptive test
version of the measure. Dr. Resnik is the PI of two centers; LeaRRn: the Learning Health Systems
Rehabilitation Research Network and CoHSTAR: the Center for Health Services, Research and Training. Both
centers train rehabilitation researchers in health services and translational research. Dr Resnik mentors
trainees and collaborate on studies of rehabilitation services (e.g., examining outcomes after traumatic brain

10864085,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Anaphylaxis is a systemic, potentially fatal, immediate hypersensitivity reaction (IHR) that can be triggered by
foods, drugs, vaccines, singing insect venom, exercise, or even idiopathically. Accurate diagnosis is essential
in both the acute setting, when medical intervention can be life-saving, and during subsequent outpatient
evaluation, when management depends on confirming the diagnosis and identifying the triggering substance.
The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is based on symptoms, which is problematic due to the wide variability of clinical
presentations and substantial overlap of allergic symptoms with other disease states. These diagnostic
complexities and lack of reliable biomarkers for IHRs contribute to the misdiagnosis and subsequent
mismanagement of food and drug allergies. Current known biomarkers for systemic allergic reactions are lacking
in that none are both sensitive and specific. Therefore, there is a sizable unmet need to discover novel
biomarkers of IHRs that are both highly-sensitive and specific for all contexts, mechanisms, and severities of
anaphylactic reactions. This proposal’s central objective is to characterize and quantify circulating extracellular
vesicles (EVs) as novel biomarkers of acute IHRs using patient samples obtained from ongoing clinical trials.
Aim 1 will characterize the quantities, surface marker expression, and contents of plasma cell-specific EVs in
adults after acute IgE-mediated IHRs to foods, and compare findings to patients’ baseline. Aim 2 will similarly
characterize EVs in adults after acute non-IgE-mediated IHRs to drugs. Aim 3 will create a biobank of patient
samples for analysis of alternative biomarkers using cutting edge technologies. This highly feasible and valuable
clinical research project is expected to identify novel biomarkers that will aid in the accurate diagnosis of
anaphylaxis as well as provide new insight into the mechanisms of certain drug IHRs. This application is in
response to the program announcement for Exploratory and Developmental Research Grant Program for NIAID
K-award Recipients. This award will provide crucial support and resources for the PI as she transitions to
research independence."
10866230,"Difficulty controlling anger is the most commonly reported reintegration concern among combat
Veterans, especially those with a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In Veterans, problematic
anger is associated with numerous negative psychosocial outcomes, including poor functional outcomes (both
social and occupational), family discord, aggression, road rage, and suicide risk. Anger can also impede
successful outcomes from PTSD treatment. Given the high prevalence of anger problems among Veterans
with PTSD and the associated functional impairments, there is a clear need to develop innovative and effective
anger interventions to improve functional outcomes. Use of mobile health (mHealth) technology could provide
a low-cost method to increase the reach of anger management treatments to this high-need group of Veterans.
 One of the mechanisms associated with problematic anger and aggression is hostile interpretation bias,
i.e., a tendency to interpret ambiguous interpersonal situations as hostile. By reducing hostile interpretation
bias, we can reduce problematic anger and aggression and improve functional outcomes. Our team has
developed and piloted a mobile application that uses evidence-based interpretation bias modification
techniques to reduce hostile interpretation bias and anger outcomes. The goal of this project is to evaluate the
efficacy of this mobile application among Veterans with PTSD.
 A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is proposed, in which 150 Veterans with PTSD and problematic
anger will be randomized to either the Mobile Anger Reduction Intervention (MARI) or a health education
condition (HED). The central hypothesis is that participants in the MARI condition will experience greater
anger reductions and functional improvements relative to the HED condition. The proposed research project
will address the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of MARI on anger outcomes (e.g.,
hostile interpretation bias, problematic anger) measured at post-treatment, 3-months, and 6-months post
treatment; Aim 2: To evaluate the efficacy of MARI on functional improvements (i.e., psychosocial functioning,
quality of life) and self-harm measured at post-treatment, 3-months, and 6-months post treatment; and
Exploratory Aim: To explore whether changes in hostile interpretation bias (proposed treatment mechanism)
mediate functional improvements.
 If shown efficacious, the public health impact of the MARI application could be enormous. MARI would
provide clinicians and Veterans with an easily accessible treatment option to improve psychosocial functioning
and anger outcomes for Veterans with PTSD. This low-cost, easily implementable, intervention would
significantly increase the reach of evidenced-based treatment for anger."
10866310,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US. The atherosclerotic process underlying
coronary heart disease is exacerbated by stressors in the vascular environment, including hyperlipidemia,
tobacco smoke, and air pollution. These stressors have been known to cause increased inflammation and
oxidative stress in the vessel wall, but how these stressors affect the different cell types in the vascular wall
has not been well-described.
 In our preliminary studies, we found that atherogenic stress can induce significant transcriptional and
epigenetic changes consistent with proteotoxicity in the atherosclerotic vascular wall. In particular, we found
that e-cigarettes activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) in smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and that this
response may be dependent on the environment sensing aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. The
overall objective of this proposal is to characterize the smooth muscle specific misfolded protein aggregates
and their functionality. The central hypothesis is that the atherogenic environment can induce tissue-specific
protein misfolding and proteotoxic stress in vascular SMCs and that AHR can protect against atherosclerosis
by limiting the proteotoxic stress. In Aim 1, we will isolate and identify the misfolded protein aggregates that are
associated with atherosclerosis and different disease-causing stimuli. In Aim 2, we will assess the role of AHR
in modulating the vascular proteostasis network utilizing primary human coronary artery SMCs in-vitro.
 Extending the results obtained from PI Dr. Kim’s NHLBI K08 career development award, the proposed
work will address a critical knowledge gap in understanding the role of proteotoxic stress in SMCs during
atherosclerosis. Ultimately, this work will shed light on novel pathways associated with risk for coronary heart
disease. The successful completion of this project will provide the foundation to apply for a larger grant (R01)
to address the effect of specific components of the vascular proteostasis network in controlling atherosclerosis."
10868768,"The chemical approach towards homogenous glycoprotein preparation and
evaluation
ABSTRACT – Our long-term goal is to uncover the unknown function of cellular and infectious
prion protein by interrogating individual homogenous prion glycoform. The objective here, is to
develop a class of efficient peptidyl coupling protocols utilizing strained molecules, such as β-
lactone and β-thiolactone, for the construction of previously unattainable targets such as cyclic
tetrapeptides and membrane prion protein. Our central hypothesis, derived from our published
results and preliminary studies described below, is that chemical synthesis can provide the PrPC
and PrPSc strains with high conformational fidelity, which allows prion biological studies to be
carried out with faithful accuracy when interrogating synthetic homogenous glyco-PrPs. The
flexibility of modifying protein construct furnishes previously unavailable tool for evaluation prion
disease. The rationale for the proposed research objectives is that the β-thiolactone and β-lactone
release of cyclic ester strain enables unprecedented rapid amide bond construction and connects
two amino acid residues. Furthermore, the near-planar geometry of the cyclobutene ring will
generate desired peptidyl adducts without epimerization by preventing the oxazolone formation.
An analogous approach could be applied to construct homogenous membrane glycoproteins from
β-thiolactone promoted protein ligation. We plan to test our central hypothesis and, thereby,
accomplish the objectives of this application via the following goals: 1. Design and expansion of
the range of constrained esters that can be utilized for peptide synthesis without epimerization. 2.
Synthesis of homogeneous cellular prion glycoproteins and congeners. 3. Biological function and
activities investigation of prepared peptide and proteins."
10866799,"Project Summary/Abstract
Parasitic helminths infect ~25% of the global population, mostly colonizing the gastrointestinal tract. Emerging
clinical evidence suggests that helminth infections, although typically non-pathogenic per se, may promote
certain viral (e.g., HIV) and bacterial (e.g., M. tuberculosis) infections by dampening protective inflammatory
immune responses. Recent studies in mice have recapitulated this phenomenon, as helminth infections were
found to impair Th1 and CD8+ T cell responses against several enteric viruses, leading to dramatically increased
viral replication in the intestine. Helminths induce a strong “type 2” immune response mediated by the
characteristic cytokines IL-4 and/or IL-13. In prior work, helminth-mediated suppression of the host’s antiviral
program required type 2 immunity, as co-infected IL4Ra-KO mice (which cannot respond to IL-4 and IL-13)
mounted robust antiviral responses and efficiently controlled viral replication. Thus, the classic “type 1 vs. type
2” immune dichotomy paradigm has been implicated in helminth promotion of viral infection. Seeking to expand
on these findings in a model of enteric adenoviral infection, we infected mice with Heligmosomoides polygyrus
(“H.p.” - a model of human chronic hookworm infection), followed by oral gavage of mouse adenovirus 2
(“mAdV2”, which models acute adenoviral gastroenteritis). At early (day 3) and late (day 14-21) time points after
viral infection, mice co-infected with H.p. + mAdV2 had dramatically increased viral titers in feces and small
intestine tissue compared with mAdV2 infection alone. Tuft cells can sense helminth infections and initiate type
2 responses, but mice lacking tuft cells (Pou2f3-KO) showed similar viral enhancement upon H.p. co-infection
as compared to WT mice. Surprisingly, all tested components of type 2 immunity were dispensable for viral
enhancement, as mice deficient for IL-4Ra, IL-5, IL-25 and IL-33R all failed to control mAdV2 when colonized
with H.p. Interestingly, infection with an unrelated helminth, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, also enhanced mAdV2
infection. Thus, in contrast to other viral infections, intestinal helminths promote mAdV2 infection independent of
type 2 immunity. This project aims to determine the mechanism of helminth-mediated mAdV2 enhancement by
testing three non-mutually-exclusive hypotheses. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that helminths blunt the
anti-mAdV2 adaptive immune response, with a particular focus on IFNg-producing CD4s recruited to the
intraepithelial compartment (as recently described) and helminth-mobilized Tregs. In Aim 2, we will assess
whether helminths promote mAdV2 infection by impairing early interferon responses. In Aim 3, we seek to
determine whether helminth secretory products, which modulate host immunity and epithelial cells independent
of type 2 signals, are responsible for mAdV2 enhancement. If successful, this project will elucidate a novel
mechanism of helminth-virus crosstalk with potential implications for human health."
10870079,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is clinical and scientific interest in developing on-demand local anesthesia, in which local anesthetics can
only be released by an external trigger when and where needed after the first administration. In the past few
years, injectable local anesthetic formulations have been developed that can generate on-demand local
anesthesia triggered by light and ultrasound. However, their clinical application is hindered by shortcomings,
such as basal drug release when the trigger is not applied, a small number of repetitive trigger events for one
injection (usually 4 to 6 times), the trigger event only occurs within a few hours after the injection, potential local
tissue toxicity caused by the external triggers, and expensive preparation procedures. In this research, in order
to overcome these shortcomings, we aim to explore cold triggered local anesthesia. The formulation design
consists of three components: tetrodotoxin (TTX), cold therapy, and thermo-responsive polymersomes. We
hypothesize that TTX is an extremely potent local anesthetic, a small amount can successfully produce local
anesthesia, thereby improving the efficacy of each trigger and increasing the number of trigger events; cold
treatment is a common use of hypothermia in medical therapy, which has the characteristics of low cost, easy
operation, and non-invasiveness; thermo-responsive polymersomes can efficiently encapsulate TTX at body
temperature, but release TTX due to the deconstruction of the polymersomes under cold treatment. In addition,
the micron-sized polymersomes can stay at the injection site for a long time, acting as a drug reservoir to achieve
long-term effects. Specifically, a large library of polymersomes with various structures (size and porosity) and
properties (structurally stability and shell stiffness) will be fabricated. Such a library will be a collection of
candidates. Iterative screening will be conducted to identify the polymersomes with the desired in vitro cold
triggerable TTX release, enhanced local retention in tissues, and excellent biocompatibility (cytotoxicity,
inflammation, myotoxicity, organ toxicity). Then, the rat footpad anesthesia model and rat paw incision wound
infiltration model will be used to evaluate the in vivo efficacy and safety of the selected polymersomes in cold
triggered local anesthesia. The expected outcome of this project is a convenient and applicable on-demand local
anesthetic formulation. Such a system will enable patients to adjust the degree of local analgesia according to
their changing needs and conditions, and will minimize the administration of systemic analgesic medications
such as opioids."

The conversion of proliferating skeletal muscle precursors (myoblasts) to terminally-differentiated myocytes
is a critical step in skeletal muscle development and repair; control of this process is therefore of
fundamental importance in both muscle development and muscle regeneration after injury. The tendency for
myogenic cells cultured densely to differentiate and, conversely, the resistance to differentiation of cells at
low density has been called the 'Community Effect'; understanding this phenomenon represents a basic
question in muscle biology. Based on our initial observation that EphA7, a juxtacrine signaling molecule, is
expressed on myocytes during embryonic and fetal myogenesis and on nascent myofibers during muscle
regeneration in vivo we examined the muscle phenotype of EphA7-/- mice. We found that their hindlimb
muscles possess fewer myofibers at birth, and those myofibers are reduced in size and have fewer
myonuclei and reduced overall numbers of precursor cells throughout postnatal life. Adult EphA7-/- mice
have reduced numbers of satellite cells and exhibit delayed and protracted muscle regeneration, and
satellite cell-derived myogenic cells from EphA7-/- mice are delayed in their expression of differentiation
markers in vitro. Exposure to exogenous EphA7 extracellular domain will rescue the null phenotype, and will
also accelerate commitment to differentiation in WT cells, which led us to propose a model in which EphA7
expression on differentiated myocytes promotes commitment of adjacent myoblasts to terminal
differentiation via reverse signaling. The experiments we propose in Aims 1 and 2 will address the role of
EphA7 in myogenic commitment in both the myocyte (""How does commitment to differentiation lead to
expression of EphA7?"") and the myoblast (""How does receiving an EphA7 signal lead to commitment to
differentiation?""). Once they have differentiated, myocytes must fuse with each other or with a growing
myotube in order to generate a functional muscle cell (the contractile myocyte fiber), thus this also
represents a critical process in both development and regeneration. However, the molecular requirements
for fusion in mammalian muscle cells have been elusive. Our data suggest EphA7 also promotes myogenic
fusion, possibly via different molecular mechanisms/interactions from its role in promoting myogenic
differentiation. The experiments we propose in Aim 3 will test the ability of EphA7 to promote fusion in
myogenic and nonmyogenic cells, determine whether it associates with the cell-surface fusogen myomaker,
and identify other protein-protein interactions it is participating in at the interface of myocytes and growing
myotubes in cis (on the same cell membrane) or in trans (on opposing cell membranes). Collectively, these
studies will address the molecular mechanisms regulating two fundamental cellular processes during
myogenic differentiation; they also have the potential to provide insight into potential innovations in muscle
stem cell expansion in vitro and thus applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine."

Clinically normal children exposed to Zika-virus (ZIKV) in utero may evidence abnormal neurodevelopment
during the first few years of life even in the absence of the severe phenotype of congenital Zika syndrome
(CZS). This is an important problem because the majority of children with in utero ZIKV exposure do not
develop CZS but are at risk for neurodevelopmental abnormalities as they mature. The risk for
neurodevelopmental impairments at school age in children with in utero ZIKV exposure, who do not have CZS,
is not known because children have neither reached nor been studied at this critical age. The long-term goal is
to recognize the spectrum of neurologic outcomes for children exposed to ZIKV in utero, which will enable
appropriate follow-up guidelines, educational interventions, and therapies to support all children exposed to
ZIKV. The objective of this application is to identify school age abnormalities in neurodevelopment and the
domains affected and to evaluate for brain structural and functional differences among children in Colombia
and in the US with ZIKV exposure in utero who do not have CZS. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will
test two specific hypotheses: 1) that executive and motor function will be negatively impacted in ZIKV-exposed
children compared to controls; and 2) that quantitative imaging will find structural and functional brain
differences between ZIKV-exposed children and controls. The children will be followed at age 5 and 7 years
using a specifically designed set of neurodevelopmental assessment tools and quantitative structural and
functional neuroimaging. Neurodevelopment will be assessed by an approach utilizing validated questionnaires
and child assessments that measure executive function, behavior, motor function, and intellectual ability. The
advanced brain MRI will provide a multimodal assessment of brain structure and function. The approach is
innovative because of access to two uniquely well characterized cohorts, one from the Caribbean coast of
Colombia who had sequential fetal and neonatal neuroimaging and had early neurodevelopmental evaluations
and a cohort from a congenital Zika program in the United States with exposure by travel or emigration. The
proposed research is significant, because it will address a key question in child health by focusing on
neurodevelopmental abnormalities in children following in utero ZIKV exposure that can manifest at school
age. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to immediately inform the development of guidelines for
neuropsychological and imaging assessment at school age for children with in utero exposure to ZIKV.
Completion of the aims will improve identification of abnormal neurologic outcomes in children who had
exposure to ZIKV in utero. The knowledge to be gained from this work is essential to be done now and is
important to families, care providers, public health policy authorities, and federal agencies. It may be also
applicable to future congenital infectious epidemics and potentially other perinatal exposures."
10870189,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The circadian rhythm orchestrates a vast repertoire of biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes with
a 24-hour period. A clock circuit, driven by the oscillatory activation and repression of a set of core clock genes,
is present in every cell and regulates the expression of nearly half the genome across all tissues. Abundant epi-
demiological evidence links circadian regulation to human health. In particular, sleep and circadian disruption is
associated with neurodegeneration, where it is thought to be both a consequence and a risk factor for Alzheimer's
disease (AD). As the most common form of dementia in the elderly, AD is rapidly becoming a public health cri-
sis, affecting an estimated 5.5M people in the United States (24M world-wide) and is expected to double over the
next 20 years. Addressing this crisis requires a deep understanding of disease mechanisms and the identiﬁcation
of diagnostic/therapeutic targets. A wealth of existing transcriptomic data, coupled with the development of
sophisticated computational tools for temporal reconstruction and analysis, provide an exciting opportunity to
identify dysregulation in oscillatory patterns of gene expression associated with aging and AD.
 We propose to develop novel computational strategies to decipher the oscillatory patterns of gene expression
using existing untimed transcriptomic datasets; and to apply them to existing data from studies of AD to identify
dysregulation in the oscillatory patterns associated with AD. Our methods address a number of analytical chal-
lenges, including the need to reconstruct temporal information from untimed samples; ensuring generalizability
and accuracy across different transcriptomic proﬁling technologies; addressing the fact that untimed samples
may not span the full day; and identifying changes in complex, non-sinusoidal rhythms. Together, these studies
will reveal oscillatory patterns of gene expression associated with aging and Alzheimers disease, and will provide
innovative new methods for the circadian analysis of untimed data that can be applied to other phenotypes."

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a complex disorder; its pathogenesis is a multi-step process that
progresses through a spectrum of histopathological changes. FK506-binding protein-51 (FKBP51, encoded by
the FKBP5 gene, also called FKBP5) belongs to the FKBP family of immunophilins. FKBP5 is an important
protein involved in the regulation of many key cellular signaling cascades. We observed a two-fold
upregulation of FKBP5 mRNA expression in the liver of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis compared to healthy
controls. The increase in Fkbp5 expression at the transcript and protein level was also observed in ethanol-fed
mice. Interestingly, loss of Fkbp5 protected against alcohol-induced liver injury. Our overarching goal is to
further understanding the mechanistic action of FKBP5 in mediating alcohol-induced liver injury. To achieve
this goal, we will first determine how alcohol induces FKBP5 expression. Our preliminary data suggested that
patients with alcoholic cirrhosis had significant downregulation in FKBP5 methylation levels at its promoter
region. In the first specific aim, we will carefully dissect the upstream pathway of how ethanol induces FKBP5
expression by testing the hypothesis that reduced methylation levels of Fkbp5 at the CpG island located at its
5’ UTR promoter region by ethanol lead to an increase in its transcript and protein expression. Next, we will
determine the downstream molecular mechanism of the alcohol-FKBP5 axis in alcohol-induced liver injury.
Our data suggested that in wild-type mice fed with ethanol, the Hippo pathway was turned off as indicated by
dephosphorylation of YAP (likely through the reduction in p-MST1/2, its upstream kinase) leading to YAP
nuclear translocation; the observation which was abrogated in Fkbp5-/- mice fed with ethanol. We will carefully
determine the mechanistic role of Fkbp5 and Yap phosphorylation, as an essential step in exploring the
downstream molecular mechanism of the alcohol-FKBP5 axis in alcohol-induced liver injury. Lastly, the
publicly available single-cell RNASeq data suggested the differential expression of FKBP5 in the hepatocytes
and other non-hepatic parenchymal cells, notably Kupffer cells. To address the role of cell-type-specific
FKBP5 in the pathogenesis of ALD, we successfully generated a novel Fkbp5 fl/fl mouse model using the
CHRISPR/Cas9 strategy. Our preliminary data illustrated that ethanol can induce the expression of Fkbp5 in
both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells with a significant induction in Kupffer cells treated with ethanol compared to
that of hepatocytes. We will test the hypothesis that the protective effect of Fkbp5 against ALD in our global
knockout model is driven primarily by Kupffer cells using Kupffer cell-specific Fkbp5-/- mouse model. Taken
together, we have developed animal and cellular models to mechanistically examine both up- and downstream
pathways on the role of FKBP5 in ALD pathogenesis. This proposal is of significance and it may lead to the
identification of potential therapeutic interventions in patients with ALD by targeting FKBP5."

Nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) are an abundant class of microbial natural products: small molecules with
evolved chemical structures and biological activities that make them an essential source of pharmaceuticals.
NRPs have served as leads for antifungal, anticancer, and immunosuppressant drugs, but are particularly
important for antibacterial therapeutics, with over 40% of approved antibiotic classes being NRPs or derivatives.
The diverse structures and activities of NRPs are generated by a conserved class of proteins known as
nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), which are composed of multi-domain modules that progressively
build NRPs as enzymatic assembly-lines. As the composition and sequence of domains within each module
determine which of >500 known monomers will be incorporated into the growing NRP, NRPS engineering has
been viewed as a promising approach for producing designer molecules in live cells. However, while ribosomal
peptides can be reprogrammed through the genetic code, NRP sequences are determined by the “adenylation
(A) domain code”, which describes a series of conserved residues and positions within the amino acyl binding
pocket. Unlike the genetic code, the A-domain code is not directly programmable, and attempts to re-write this
code and which amino acid is activated by a given domain generally results in poorly active enzymes.
Transplantation of binding pockets can occasionally yield domains and modules with desired specificity, but this
often fails and still relies on access to characterized protein donors. Directed evolution is a promising approach
for re-coding NRPSs, but current methods are slow, manual, and bespoke solutions that rely on specific activities
from the resulting natural product or on reactive chemical handles. In this proposal, we will develop a plug-and-
play platform for the continuous directed evolution of NRPS activity and substrate specificity. This approach uses
promiscuous NRPS components known as epimerization domains and type II thioesterase domains to convert
amino acids selected by A domains into (D) isomers. As (D) amino acids (D-AAs) are not present in the cell, they
can be selectively detected and quantified by natural D-AA transcription factors, linking NRPS activity and
specificity directly to gene expression. In aim 1, we will demonstrate the generation of D-AA signals from NRPS
modules and optimize D-AA transcription factors, enabling live cell reporting for NRPS substrate specificity. In
aim 2, we will use this system to drive phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) of NRPS modules, providing
a rapid and adaptable means of evolving highly functional enzymes with desired substrate specificities. This
proposal will deliver the first live-cell reporter system for NRPS substrate specificity and enable the rapid
evolution of NRPS components with designer specificities. These advances will unlock our ability to program
these pharmaceutical assembly-lines for on-demand production of designer molecules in live cells."
10867142,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Eating disorders are one of the deadliest psychiatric disorders and are associated with high economic burden
and numerous physical health consequences. One group at significantly increased risk for eating disorders is
sexual minority (SM; e.g., gay, lesbian, bisexual, non-heterosexual) individuals. Indeed, nationally
representative data in the United States supports that SM adults of all genders have a 2-3-fold increased risk
of developing an eating disorder compared to their non-SM peers. Critically, these disparities have persisted
during the past decade, with no signs of attenuating, making SM individuals one of the most high-risk groups
for eating disorders. Risk is elevated in SM individuals due to chronic stressors and subsequent SM stress
reactions (e.g., internalized stigma, low SM-stress coping self-efficacy) related to being a marginalized group.
While SM individuals are seeking eating disorder treatment at increasing rates compared to non-SM peers,
current treatments do not incorporate distinct SM identity-related stress processes that increase and maintain
eating disorder symptoms in SM individuals. Further, SM individuals are more likely to drop out of existing
eating disorder treatments compared to their non-SM peers. This suggests that identity-affirming treatments
that address the unique needs of SM individuals with eating disorders could reduce barriers to treatment and
treatment dropout in a vulnerable group. Given this crucial gap in the literature, the proposed study will refine
and test an innovative virtually delivered treatment that integrates evidence-based care for eating disorders
with SM-affirmative treatment (Promoting Resilience to Improve Disordered Eating; PRIDE) designed to target
distinct identity-related stress processes (e.g., reductions in internalized stigma and increases in SM-stress
coping self-efficacy) that theoretically underlie increased risk for eating disorders in SM individuals. If PRIDE
displays a clinically meaningful effect on the purported targets (i.e., reduction in internalized stigma and
increases in SM-stress coping self-efficacy) through 6-month follow-up during the open-phase trial (R61 phase;
n = 30) and is feasible and acceptable, we will subsequently move to the R33 phase. In the R33 phase, we will
conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial in 160 SM adults with eating disorders comparing PRIDE to
supportive treatment to assess preliminary efficacy through 12-month follow-up. During the randomized
controlled trial, we will also evaluate the mechanisms of action of the PRIDE treatment (e.g., reductions in
internalized stigma and increases in SM-stress coping self-efficacy) through longitudinal analysis. The
proposed project has substantial public health significance as SM adults are one of the most vulnerable groups
for eating disorders. Given the virtual nature of PRIDE, this treatment has a high potential for wide
dissemination and to reduce the public health impact of eating disorders in a vulnerable group."
10871371,"Project Summary/Abstract: Social networks (SNs), and the supports derived from them, are established
determinants of health and mortality for the general population and are especially important for individuals with
serious mental illnesses (SMIs; e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar, depression). Individuals with SMIs die
approximately 10-30 years before their peers without SMIs, in part due to a lack of necessary supports and
resources. These inequalities are even more profound for Black and Latinx individuals with SMIs, whose
networks are known to be limited by systemic racism, stigma, and discrimination. Yet existing research has
focused primarily on White individuals. Most prior research focused on how social-cognitive deficits due to
SMIs can erode SNs and lead to social isolation. However, there is growing evidence that non-clinical (e.g.,
race and mental illness stigma) and systemic factors (e.g., incarceration, housing) are equally powerful
predictors of SNs. It is critical to understand how risk and protective factors affect trajectories of SN size,
composition, function, and experiences because these ultimately influence mental health services outcomes
(e.g., mental health services engagement). The proposed longitudinal, mixed-method study (N=600)
comprehensively investigates the SNs of Black and Latinx individuals with SMIs. It assesses how their SNs
change over an 18-month period due to clinical (i.e., social cognition, self-efficacy, social motivation, and
substance use); non-clinical (i.e., stigma); and systemic (i.e., incarceration and hospitalization) risk and
protective factors. We hypothesize that systemic factors will have stronger associations (as compared to
clinical or non-clinical factors) with SN elements and consequently, mental health services outcomes both at
baseline and over time. The proposed study builds on the PIs’ previously developed, stakeholder-defined
theoretical SN framework encompassing SN structure (size, compositional stability); function (social support,
social resources); and derived experiences (sense of belonging, social isolation). We use an innovative ego-
centric SN mapping methodology to conceptualize and measure SN elements at 3 time points (baseline, 9, and
18 months) and test if these relationships are moderated by race/ethnicity over time. In addition to structured
assessments and SN maps, the study utilizes in-depth semi-structured interviews with Black and Latinx
individuals with SMIs (N=50; 25 per group) at baseline and 18 months. To be conducted in collaboration with
community partners and key stakeholders, these interviews will help further demystify the relationships
between different risk and protective factors and SN elements. We will compare and contrast the qualitative
findings with the quantitative results to provide critical mechanistic information about intervention targets to
enhance SNs and increase mental health service engagement and satisfaction among Black and Latinx
individuals with SMIs. These individuals are highly vulnerable to SN deterioration, have an increased burden of
illness, and remain overwhelmingly under-represented in SN research."
10871482,"Abstract
Despite advances in automation, manual material handling (MMH) tasks continue to be commonplace in the
workplace. To design and control the high burden of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) during MMH tasks,
several assessment tools have been proposed to monitor injury risk factors such as posture, repetition and force.
However, several fundamental limitations of current tools affect their effectiveness in controlling injury risk
factors. First, tools currently used in practiced are typically cross-sectional and observer-based. These manually
observed snapshots of the jobs are insufficient for capturing the complex exposures (e.g., varying frequencies,
loads, hand-load couplings) that workers experience daily in MMH. Second, worker force exertion is a key causal
factor for MS injuries, and unlike repetition and posture, force exertions are “invisible” such that even trained
ergonomists have difficulty assessing without interfering with the workers or the hand-material interfaces. Finally,
current tools are not practical at scale for capturing the individual exposures of every worker at every task (e.g.,
time and labor cost of trained analysts to directly observe or videotape the workers).
This proposal aims to address the need for automated systems for predicting workers’ hand, wrist, and forearm
injury risk in manual material handling (MMH) tasks. We propose innovative low cost, sensitive, and scalable
triboelectric glove system with advanced deep-learning techniques. The proposed tool will be the first all-
in-one glove system that can automatically assess all metrics required for the American Conference of
Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Value (TLV) for Hand Activity Level (HAL).
Three studies are proposed: 1) material engineering to produce reliable triboelectric sensors at scale, 2) iterative,
user-centered design of multi-modal glove sensors for MMH, 2) experiments to train artificial intelligence models
for predicting HAL TLV, and 3) demonstration of the technology in real work environments. The expected
immediate outcomes of this work will result in a novel system that can impact two critical challenges in
managing workplace hand/wrist MSDs: 1) scalable, automated assessment methods that can continuously
monitor the high varied MMH tasks and 2) enable practitioners to assess the “invisible” force exertion risk factor
that current relies on techniques such as force matching or manually weighing objects. This work aligns with
NIOSH’s overall strategic goal of reducing occupational musculoskeletal disorders and have cross-sector
impacts, specifically the immediate goal of reducing musculoskeletal disorders with emerging technologies."
10871177,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rates of firearm injuries reached unprecedented levels during the COVID-19 pandemic,
disproportionally represented women and children, and rates remain at historical high levels in
2023. Exposure to firearm injury is associated with increased adverse health outcomes and
mental health needs, further compounding existing health and racial inequities. Prior research
has focused on health outcomes and interventions at the individual level and community level,
with less attention focused on family and household member’s health outcomes due to both
methodological challenges and data limitations. Therefore, current health interventions may
miss the “ripple effect” of traumatic health events. The lack of methods linking family and
household members is a significant roadblock for clinical and translational science. Elucidating
these methods could increase the ‘translational efficiency’ in studying the broader population
health, the mechanisms, and impacts of one of the most pressing public health challenges –
firearm injury – and identify opportunities for health interventions that mitigate adverse health
outcomes. The central objectives of this proposal are 1) to develop methods to identify and
link family and household members at the family and household level and 2) examine change in
clinical care utilization, mental health, chronic conditions, and firearm injury among non-
household family, household family members, and non-family household members of firearm
injury survivors following the injury. To achieve this methodologic goal, we will leverage a
unique longitudinal dataset of individually-linked data and residential addresses from clinical
systems, public health, Medicaid, and police records in Indianapolis (Marion County), Indiana
from 2000 – 2022. The proposed study is focused on nonfatal firearm injury, as an extension of
Dr. Lauren Magee’s KL2 project and research portfolio; however, the methodological
approaches can be applied to a variety of vulnerable populations to identify opportunities for
intervention across a variety of health outcomes. Findings will demonstrate the feasibility of
linking family and household members at the family and household level using administrative
data and will significantly extend our understanding of the racial and health inequities
associated with exposure to firearm injury beyond the direct survivor to inform clinical and
community interventions to prevent future morbidity and mortality. This proposal will also
address a significant roadblock for clinical and translational science and continue Dr. Magee’s
development as a scholar in translational science."

 The primary goal of the Research Education Program in the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and
Neck Surgery (OtoHNS) at the University of Washington (UW) is to provide every resident in our department
with knowledge, skills, and inspiration to establish an independent and sustainable research program in an
academic setting as a Clinician-Scientist. We also offer research training and education to medical students to
encourage them to pursue academic careers in Otolaryngology. The long-term goal of our program is to
increase the research contributions of Otolaryngologists and to hasten development of better treatment options
for patients with disorders impacting communication.
 Our research training program has had outstanding outcomes under support of a NIDCD T32 Grant for
40 years. For example, 64% of the resident Participants in the past 15 years are in full-time academic
positions. To continue these efforts, we request support for five Postdoctoral (resident) Participants and
one Predoctoral (medical student) Participant. The OtoHNS Department contributes funds for this training
and also offers 1-2 years of Post-Residency Fellowship to one resident in our Program to continue mentored
research training, prepare a K Award application, and gain additional clinical training. We are dedicated to
training diverse Participants. We evaluate Program outcomes using input from Participants, Preceptors, and an
Advisory Board, and we use feedback to build best practices and meet the changing needs of Participants.
 We propose two major aims: mentored research training (Aim 1) and structured research
education (Aim 2). For Aim 1, every resident receives intensive research training with an experienced, well-
resourced Preceptor for 80% of their working hours during a one-year or two-year period, starting in the third
year of residency. Before this, residents select a Preceptor, either amongst the 23 Preceptors we describe or
another Preceptor who fits our strict criteria. Together, they define a research project and a training plan.
During the R25-funded year(s), Participants conduct research in their Preceptor’s group, learning the critical
skills needed for research success. Concurrently, residents attend structured research educational
sessions (Aim 2) with OtoHNS faculty and Program Alumni who impart key research skills and provide
guidance for career development in academic Otolaryngology. Residents spend 20% of the R25 year(s) in
clinical training. After the R25-supported time, residents continue research activities, facilitated by a
department-supported research rotation with minimal clinical activities. Medical student Participants engage in
the same mentored research and educational elements as residents for 9 months, working closely with them.
Our Program prepares Participants at both levels for successful careers in academic medicine."
10876399,"Project Summary/Abstract
Major causes of the opiate crisis are the addictive nature of opiates and the negative physiological and
psychological effects of withdrawal that lead to relapse. These effects persist for months or years after the last
dose is taken. In recent work we have found what may be the largest change in neuronal morphology in the
brain of human heroin addicts; an average 54% increase in the number of neurons producing detectable
levels of hypocretin (Hcrt, orexin), and an average 32% shrinkage in the volume of hypocretin neurons.
Adjacent melanin concentrating hormone neurons do not change in number or size. We saw a similar long-
lasting increase in the number of detected hypocretin cells and a shrinkage of these neurons, accompanied by
elevated levels of brain hypocretin, in wild-type mice after longterm, but not short term, morphine
administration. The increase in hypocretin cell number is not due to neurogenesis, but rather to increased
production of hypocretin in neurons that do not produce detectable levels of these peptides under baseline
conditions. Our pilot data, using a newly developed transgenic mouse in which hypocretin neurons can be
selectively deleted (DTA-Hcrt mice), shows that removal of hypocretin neurons greatly reduces withdrawal
symptoms and the expression of the molecular markers Fos and DeltaFosB in addiction related regions.
These preliminary findings suggest that a blockade of hypocretin receptors, a decrease in of the activity of
hypocretin neurons, or a reduction of elevated hypocretin neuronal number back to baseline levels would aid
in withdrawal and prevent relapse in human opiate addicts. We propose to identify the opiate receptors
responsible for the changes in hypocretin cell number and size. We will record from hypocretin neurons in
freely moving animals using our chronic unit recording technique to determine, for the first time, how the
response of these cells to systemic morphine changes with addiction and withdrawal. We will determine how
the newly identifiable hypocretin producing cells induced by opiate administration differ from the baseline
population in distribution, projection, and co-transmitters. We will determine the changes in the receptor and
membrane physiology of hypocretin neurons produced by opiates using in vitro techniques. In our prior
work we found that human narcolepsy is caused by an average 90% loss of hypocretin cells. Of great interest,
is that human narcoleptics rarely abuse or escalate dosage of therapeutic drugs, even though the
amphetamines, methylphenidate and gamma hydroxy-butyrate that they take daily to reverse symptoms are
frequently abused in the non-narcoleptic population. The increased activity of hypocretin neurons that we
find in mice after morphine administration, the greatly increased number of hypocretin cells in human
addicts, and the greatly decreased number of hypocretin cells in narcoleptics, who are resistant to
drug addiction, suggests that hypocretin neurons have a major role in maintaining opiate addiction and
relapse. Manipulation of hypocretin neurons may be the key to facilitating withdrawal in addicts."
10880546,"ABSTRACT
There is a normative decrease in problem alcohol use that naturally occurs in the mid-20s after binge and
heavy drinking peak, a process called “maturing out”. While most young adults mature out of problem use, a
subset persist or escalate in their drinking; these individuals are at risk for lifetime struggles with alcohol use
disorders. What differentiates those who mature out of problem drinking versus those who do not is not fully
understood. Developmental changes in the brain are hypothesized to play a central role in the alcohol
consumption shifts that define the maturing out period, as neural maturation is not fully complete until the mid-
20s. Furthermore, young adulthood is a critical neurodevelopmental period when subcortical emotion and
reward-related and cortical cognitive control regions mature, concomitant with improvements in executive
control and declines in impulsivity and sensation-seeking. Despite the presumed effect that neural maturation
has on decreases in risky behavior (like heavy alcohol use), no study has directly tested associations between
neurobiological processes and trajectories of alcohol use in young adulthood.
For this study, we will recruit 400 individuals between the ages of 21 and 25 (50% female) who report at least
one binge drinking episode a month for the past 3 months to undergo high-resolution structural magnetic
resonance and functional imaging scans (cognitive control, emotion regulation, alcohol cue reactivity, and
resting state) at baseline. Detailed neuropsychological and psychosocial measurements will also be collected.
Follow-up assessments will consist of 1) self-report alcohol use, measured online every 3 months post-scan to
examine trajectories of use, and 2) neuropsychological and psychosocial measurements, collected online
every year post-scan. Participants will be recruited during Years 1–3. Follow-up assessments will be collected
until the end of the study, maximizing the data collection period and allowing for a large follow-up age range
(25–29 years). We will model alcohol use trajectories across time, using baseline imaging data as a marker to
differentiate or predict participants who persist or desist in use. This design will allow us to 1) determine the
extent to which neural and behavioral mechanisms of cognitive control, emotion regulation, and reward/cue
reactivity predict drinking trajectories, and 2) examine the effect of problem drinking on these processes. As
sex differences in cognitive control, emotion, and reward development likely introduce variability in alcohol use,
3) we will also characterize sex differences predictive of alcohol use trajectories. As an exploratory analysis,
we will investigate neurobiological predictors of maturing out using multimodal (structure, resting state, task)
MRI data analysis."
10880548,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The proposed project will investigate the impacts of maternal and paternal incarceration on
children’s health and wellbeing from birth to young adulthood. The most rigorous studies to date
have not yielded a consensus on the magnitude, consistency, or even direction of parental
incarceration’s causal effects, particularly for children in high-risk environments. Prior research
on the effects of experiencing parental incarceration is limited by truncated observation periods,
sample attrition, self-report measures of incarceration and child wellbeing, and lack of data on
criminal charges or the context of incarceration itself. In contrast, the proposed study will
construct two statewide birth cohorts (children born 2000-2002 and 2009-2011, totaling
approximately 400,000 children), allowing for assessment of health and development at all
stages of childhood and into early adulthood. Developmental domains include physical and
mental health, cognitive/educational outcomes, and (in adolescence and early adulthood)
pregnancy and parenthood, criminal activity, educational attainment, and employment/earnings.
 In Aim 1, we estimate impacts of maternal and paternal incarceration on children’s health
and wellbeing from birth through early adulthood. We will compare children exposed to parental
incarceration to the general population and to children in various counterfactual conditions (e.g.,
children whose parents are involved with the criminal justice system but not incarcerated). We
account for observable factors that correlate with both parental incarceration and child
wellbeing. We also leverage approaches for isolating causal effects (e.g., within-person
estimation, instrumental variables). In Aim 2, we investigate the contributions of maternal and
paternal incarceration to disparities in health and wellbeing for Black, white and Hispanic
children, with attention to the differences in social and economic opportunities and treatment
within the criminal justice system that underlie disparities in exposure to parental incarceration.
Lastly, in Aim 3, we assess—overall and by race/ethnicity—the role of children’s social
environments prior to maternal or paternal incarceration, and changes to their environments
during and subsequent to parental incarceration, in explaining how and for whom parental
incarceration may impact child health and wellbeing. We consider aspects of the social
environment to include living arrangements (e.g., with a parent, with relatives, in foster care)
before, during, and after parental incarceration, as well as the economic resources and
caregiver characteristics within these environments."
10880675,"The 2020 NHGRI Strategic plan highlights the need for facilitating data and resource interoperability for
advancing genomic research and promoting data reuse. The Human Disease Ontology (DO) Knowledgebase
will provide a sustainable approach for linking the growing bodies of information related to core datasets across
genomic and proteomic resources, as interoperable genomic resources enable precision medicine and
knowledge dissemination. The DO plays a key role in disease knowledge organization, representation, and
standardization, serving as a reference framework for multiscale biomedical data integration and analysis across
thousands of clinical, biomedical and computational researchers and genomic resources around the world.
Expanding the DO’s disease data and models for complex diseases will provide a comprehensive network of
disease to disease relationships (DO’s diseasome) that represents a disease feature similarity network for clinical
differential diagnosis exploration. We will deepen our knowledge and understanding of the interrelationships
between genomics and the social and environmental factors that influence human health. We will deliver an
increasingly comprehensive view of the roles and relationships of genomic variation, biomolecules,
environmental drivers and regulatory elements on biological processes, and address the need for genomics
training in the clinical workforce. We will build beyond the current set of coordinating genomic resources, offering
increasingly automated approaches for aggregating and linking disease metadata in a scalable and cost-effective
manner. The DO Knowledgebase will expand content, capacity to support the development of genomic data
science and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) methods. The overall goal of this proposal is to
facilitate the linking of disease data via the DO’s diseaseome across broadly useful biomedical, clinical genomic,
proteomic and epigenomic resources, to drive innovative machine learning research and to provide a resource
for optimizing clinical care. The DO serves as the de facto standard for disease etiology across biomedical data
repositories. Conservatively, based on available resource statistics, terms from the DO have been annotated to
over 1.5 million biomedical data elements and citations, a 10x increase in the past 5 years. Our proposed
aims position us well for providing a comprehensive disease resource for the genomic community. We have
identified three main areas of improvement in the DO Knowledgebase to achieve our goals: (1) aggregating
disease information across genomic resources, modeling complex disease and defining the disease
environmental exposome; (2) automating the DO’s production workflow, enabling federated resource querying,
producing a multi-lingual DO and dissemination of ML/AI ready datasets; (3) maintaining and expanding the
DO’s collaborations, establishing a clinical training nosology program and convening topical focus groups."
10880676,"Project Summary
Hypertension affects more than 60 million people in the US and despite its diverse causes,
blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) lowers blood pressure in the majority of
hypertensive patients. ACE2 is the newest member of the RAS, and our previous work has
established that ACE2 protects against hypertension with actions in the kidney to metabolize
angiotensin II, thus regulating the RAS. As part of our overall goal of understanding how the
RAS impacts BP, we have employed cell-specific gene-targeting and kidney cross-
transplantation in mice to identify the key cellular sources of ACE2 for BP regulation. We found
that mice lacking ACE2 specifically from the proximal tubule (PTACE2KO), the cell type with
highest expression of ACE2 in the kidney, have exaggerated BP elevation in the early phase of
angiotensin II hypertension, associated with enhanced accumulation of angiotensin II peptide in
kidney and ≈50% reduction in urinary excretion of sACE2. Based on kidney cross-
transplantation experiments, the development of hypertension was associated with significant
reductions in sACE2 in both serum and urine whereas sACE2 appeared to normalize BP in
mice lacking renal expression. Thus, our findings suggest ACE2 originating from the PT of the
kidney plays a key role in the initiation of angiotensin II-dependent hypertension, and that kidney
and systemic tissues both contribute to sACE2 in urine. Our new data expand knowledge of
how ACE2 can impact the RAS and BP. This revised proposal aims to define molecular
mechanisms contributing to hypertension in PTACE2KO mice; establish relative contribution of
extra-renal ACE2 and shedding to BP regulation and vascular function with new animal models;
and delineate mechanism by which ACE2 reaches the lumen of the nephron to balance the
RAS. We anticipate our studies will shift the existing paradigm around how ACE2 functions to
regulate BP and moderate kidney function with high relevance to disease states where ACE2 is
dysregulated."
10881660,"Summary
 Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by lung vascular endothelial (EC) barrier compromise resulting in
increased EC permeability and pulmonary edema. The infections of Gram negative bacteria compose the major
cause for ALI. Little has been known about how Gram negative endotoxins (i.e. lipopolysaccharides, LPS) induce
EC barrier disruption. We found that LPS activates endopeptidase, calpain, in human lung microvascular ECs
(HLMVECs) and the specific calpain inhibition prevents LPS-induced disruption of EC barrier function of
HLMVECs and LPS-induced pulmonary edema in ALI. Calpain is a family of calcium-dependent non-lysosomal
neutral cysteine endopeptidases that act via limited proteolysis of substrate proteins in mammalian cells,
including HLMVECs. Our preliminary data show that LPS induces talin cleavage into head and rod domain and
talin phosphorylation in HLMVECs and that overexpression of calpain causes talin cleavage and RhoA activation
and myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) phosphorylation resulting in MLCP inhibition and myosin light chain
(MLC) phosphorylation. Talin is activated through talin cleavage or phosphorylation. Talin cleavage separates
head from rod domain thus removing auto-inhibition and stimulating talin head binding to integrin and thus
induces FA activation, leading to RhoA activation and MLCP inhibition and MLC phosphorylation and increased
lung EC permeability. Talin activation through phosphorylation at Ser-425 can be through cyclin-dependent
kinase 5 (CDK5). Our data show that calpain inhibition attenuates LPS-induced increase in CDK5 activity and
that MLCP is involved in talin dephosphorylation. This proposal is to study a novel hypothesis that calpain/MLCP
coordination regulates talin activation (cleavage/phosphorylation) leading to endothelial barrier disruption in ALI.
We will determine whether Gram negative endotoxin LPS, E. coli and P. aeruginosa induce calpain activation
and calpain leads to lung microvascular endothelial barrier disruption and Rho-mediated MLCP
phosphorylation/inhibition and MLC phosphorylation in ALI. We will define whether LPS, E. coli and P.
aeruginosa induce talin activation (cleavage/phosphorylation) and FA strengthening, leading to lung
microvascular endothelial barrier disruption in vitro and in vivo. We will investigate whether calpain regulates
talin activation (cleavage/phosphorylation) in lung microvascular endothelial barrier disruption in ALI induced by
LPS, E. coli and P. aeruginosa. We will assess whether plasma from ALI patients with Gram negative sepsis
induces HLMVEC barrier compromise via calpain-talin-FA-MLCP pathway. This proposal is novel because it will
identify calpain as mediators in lung EC barrier compromise and calpain serves this role by regulating novel talin
cleavage/phosphorylation, RhoA activation and MLCP activity in ALI. A better understanding of the mechanistic
insight will provide a framework from which novel calpain inhibition and MLCP activation strategies can be
developed for intervention and treatment of ALI."
10881662,"Current research activities are focused on Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), Parkinson’s Disease (PD), and Multiple
Sclerosis (MS). SCI is a complex debilitating condition leading to life-long neurological deficits as well as bone
loss and muscle atrophy due to immobility. Our laboratory was among the first to show that estrogen (E2) drives
neuroprotection in experimental SCI in rats, suggesting E2 warrants clinical evaluation in neurotrauma. New
smart drug delivery techniques, including nanoparticles, may allow for increased drug safety and improved
efficacy. Thus, the goal is to examine the effects of a novel slow release E2-loaded nanoparticle (SNP-E2) gel
patch on neuronal dysfunction and skeletal muscle loss in a rat model of SCI. We hypothesize that focal delivery
of estrogen via slow release nanoparticles SNP-E2 will maintain low systemic E2 levels (plasma) and higher
tissue concentrations, thereby allowing for maximized therapeutic potential for recovery from neural and skeletal
muscle loss in SCI. To test the hypothesis, two specific aims are proposed: (Aim 1) Examine the delivery of a
novel slow release SNP-E2 and determine its kinetics, bio-distribution, toxicity, and effects in moderate and
severe SCI and (Aim 2) Determine the effects of SNP-E2 on alterations of skeletal muscle loss in moderate and
severe SCI. Overall, the proposed studies should provide a safe and novel strategy to improve health and
functional recovery for Veterans with SCI.
 Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive degenerative disorder affecting almost 80,000 Veterans. While
the mechanisms of this degenerative process remain elusive, chronic inflammation may be involved. Calpain
not only plays a pivotal role in brain (SN-DA neurons) and spinal cord (SC) degeneration, it may also drive
inflammation and disease progression. Inhibition of calpain attenuates a distinct subpopulation of T cells in
MPTP mice, suggesting calpain’s involvement in the inflammatory process. Our goal is to develop therapeutic
strategies to treat PD with agents that block the inflammatory process, protect neurons, control disease
progression, and improve function. We hypothesize that calpain activation, infiltration of inflammatory T cells
(Th1/Th17), and released cytokines and chemokines are involved in progressive degeneration of PD, and calpain
inhibitor treatment may reduce degeneration, slow disease progression, and improve function. Two specific aims
will test the hypothesis: (Aim 1) Investigate the role of calpain regulation and T cell infiltration in SC degeneration
and disease progression in MPTP mice, characterize infiltrating T cells, assess cytokine/chemokine levels in
sera, and determine cell death parameters and calpain activation in SC; (Aim 2) Examine whether treatment of
MPTP mice with calpain inhibitor will reduce degenerative inflammatory events and improve function.
 Increased calpain activity has also been found in MS as well as in its animal model [experimental autoimmune
disease (EAE)], and calpain is implicated in the activation of T cells (Th1/Th17), degradation of axon/myelin, and
T cell chemotaxis. While calpain is activated in brain and spinal cord of MS patients, the precise involvement of
the two calpain isoforms, calpain-1 and calpain-2, remains undefined. We hypothesize that activation of distinct
calpain isoform may favor expansion of inflammatory mediators and Th1/Th17 cells in MS patients, which could
be attenuated by calpain inhibition. Studies include (Aim 1) testing MS patient samples to determine which of
the two major calpain isoforms is involved in dysregulation of immune cell types, influencing immune arms of the
disease; and (Aim 2) Investigating whether a distinct calpain isoform is linked with disease progression, influ-
encing the neurodegenerative process in MS. Data obtained will reveal the effect of calpain inhibitor on inhibition
of specific calpains and attenuation of both immune and neurodegenerative arms of the disease for developing
novel therapy for treating MS and other neurodegenerative diseases. The overall goal of these research projects
is to minimize degeneration and maximize function and improve the health of our Veterans."

NCI funding for 20 years with 197 peer-reviewed publications, and over 220 scientific abstracts. His research
aims for a better understanding of the biology of gastro-esophageal cancers and developing novel therapeutic
approaches. His laboratory provides unique training experiences in genetics, epigenetics, and cancer biology,
focusing on molecular mechanisms of gastrointestinal tumorigenesis and the development of novel strategies
for cancer therapeutics. Dr. El-Rifai has trained more than 75 personnel that included undergraduate and
graduate students, postdocs, and residents. He has mentored more than 15 junior faculty members, many of
whom have progressed to independent faculty positions. Dr. El-Rifai’s laboratory works closely with basic
science and clinical research colleagues for one common goal; a better clinical outcome. The El-Rifai laboratory
utilizes innovative mouse models, 3D organoid cultures, and human tissue samples. Dr. El-Rifai has made
significant contributions in the area of gastric cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma. He has been successful
in identifying the signaling links between inflammation and cancer in gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas,
discovering novel genes that mediate drug resistance, and developing targeted therapy approaches for upper
GI cancers. Dr. El-Rifai work using the trefoil factor 1 knockout mouse model in conjunction with in vitro assays
and human tissues samples has shown that TFF1 has potent anti-inflammatory and tumor suppressor functions,
which protect against the development of gastric cancer in mouse and human. Dr. El-Rifai lab has made
significant contributions to the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development
of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Barrett’s esophagus, the main risk factor for EAC, develops as a
consequence of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease. He demonstrated an epigenetic switch that turns off
several anti-tumorigenic antioxidant response genes, concordant with activation of other genes that promote a
pro-tumorigenic antioxidant response. The pioneering work from his lab has shown that DNA methylation wipes
out the expression of several protective antioxidant enzymes, important for protecting against reflux-induced
oxidative stress and DNA damage, thereby facilitating progression of metaplastic Barrett’s esophagus to EAC.
The pro-tumorigenic response included constitutive overexpression of redox factor 1 (REF1, also known as
APE1) and transcription factor NFE2- related factor 2 (NRF2), promoting DNA damage repair, oncogenic
signaling, and cancer cell survival Working with pharmaceutical companies, he tested novel targeted therapy
strategies and established MLN8237, alisertib, as a potent anti-cancer drug. MLN8237 is now listed on the NCI
Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) and is studied in several clinical trials. Dr. El-
Rifai, working with medical oncology colleagues, has moved several concepts such as targeting AURKA and
mTOR into clinical trials. In summary, cancer is a disease with no boundaries; Dr. El-Rifai has a firm belief that
clinical and translational research founded on strong basic science discoveries is the way to win our battle
against cancer."

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is spread through the saliva, where it establishes oropharyngeal
infection, invades the tonsils and colonizes the B-cell compartment. Orally transmitted EBV is
the cause of infectious mononucleosis and of multiple B-cell and epithelial cancers, including
Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Much remains to be learned about how
epigenetic regulation of the viral genome enables it to colonize the oropharynx and tonsils to
establish persistent infection of >95% adults and to cause 200,000 cancers per year. In tonsillar
memory B-cells, EBV expresses a single, poorly immunogenic antigen. BL, which can present
as tumors of the jaws, face and orbit, use a similar viral program to evade anti-EBV T-cell
responses. By contrast, EBV expresses nearly 80 viral proteins in AIDS patients with oral hairy
leukoplakia of the tongue, and as many as immunogenic eight latency proteins in post-
transplant lymphoma. During the initial post-doctoral period, the applicant used two CRISPR
screens to characterize B-cell factors important for EBV latency in BL. These provided insights
into epigenetic pathways that restrict expression of lytic cycle and latency genes in B-cells and
highlighted epigenetic enzymes that initiate and maintain a high level of DNA methylation of the
EBV genome in this highly restricted form of latency. Perturbation of EBV DNA methylation de-
represses EBV antigen expression and sensitizes Burkitt cells to CD8+ T-cell recognition. Yet,
little is known about cross-talk between infected B-cell metabolism and epigenetic pathways,
which must occur to supply methyl groups for DNA and histone modification. The applicant
hypothesizes that latently EBV-infected B cells subvert methionine and folate metabolism
pathways to drive EBV genome hypermethylation necessary for silencing of immunogenic EBV
gene products and T-cell immunoevasion. During the mentored K99 phase, the applicant will 1)
identify how methionine metabolism contributes to EBV genome hypermethylation and silencing
in latently infected B-cells and EBV oncoproteins, and 2) characterize the interplay between the
folate cycle and EBV genome methylation in latently-infected cells. During the R00 phase, the
applicant will perform independent research to identify how latent EBV programs alter B-cell
metabolic pathways to reinforce viral genome epigenetic states at the level of DNA and histone
methylation. Collectively, these studies will open a new area of EBV biology and promise to
support novel therapeutic approaches. The career development plan will prepare the applicant
for transition to independence as an investigator with a multi-disciplinary approach to study
metabolomic control of virus/host interactions."

The Candidate is a young investigator dedicated to developing an academic career focused on understanding
the mechanisms by which ethanol disrupts balance between immune cell survival and death pathways. With a
strong background in liver diseases and related innate immunity, the candidate has developed particular
expertise in the use of in vivo and cell culture models to conduct the proposed studies. The Candidate’s current
work has provided her with the opportunity to develop her own research program and begin her transition to
independence. The Career Development Plan outlines 2-years of mentored training on technical skills and
career development activities designed to promote the successful transition to independence. A 3-year program
of independent scientific and career development after successful recruitment as an Assistant Professor position
is also outlined. The Candidate’s Mentor has a proven track-record of excellent scientific productivity and
successful mentorship and can provide the Candidate with a solid research environment in her lab. Research
plan: Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) remains a major socioeconomic burden with high morbidity and
mortality. Activation of innate immunity not only contributes to progression of ALD, but is also critical for resolution
of injury. Appropriate regulation of pro-survival and pro-death pathways is critical to the ability of innate immune
cells to rapidly respond to maintain liver homeostasis in ethanol-induced injury. MLKL-mediated necroptosis plays
a dual role in tissue injury/repair. Whether MLKL-mediated necroptosis of immune cells is beneficial or
detrimental in the context of ethanol is unknown. In preliminary work, Mlkl deficiency in myeloid cells exacerbated
ethanol-induced injury, associated with increased ethanol-induced accumulation of hepatic macrophages and
neutrophils. Importantly, we found that Gao-binge increased necrosis/necroptosis of hepatic F4/80+ cells,
suggesting that MLKL may protect from ethanol-induced injury by promoting macrophage death and resolution
of inflammation. Together, these data led us to hypothesize that myeloid cell-specific MLKL restricts ethanol-
induced injury by regulating hepatic immune cell survival and death. To test this hypothesis, hepatic immune cell
populations and death will be characterized by flow cytometric analysis of isolated NPCs from livers of Mlkl BM
chimeras after Gao-binge. We will then challenge cell-specific knock-outs (LysM, Clec4f and MRP8 CRE crossed
with Mlklfl/fl) to ethanol, to distinguish cell-specific contributions of MLKL to mALD. Further, a phospho-proteomics
paired with targeted mechanistic approaches will be utilized to determine whether ethanol-mediated activation
of MLKL is RIP3-dependent and/or RIP3-independent. Additionally, since neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular
traps (NETs) are important in ALD, the project will further explore whether neutrophil-specific MLKL limits
ethanol-induced injury by regulating NETs. Altogether, this proposal will provide a solid foundation for future
mechanistic studies and clinical interventions for ethanol-induced injury and inflammation."

The developing mammalian cochlea generates two types of mechanosensors: Inner hair cells (IHCs), endowed
with a prominent presynaptic apparatus, transmit sound information to neurons and the brain; outer hair cells
(OHCs), equipped for electromotility, are used for amplification and sharp frequency discrimination of sounds.
Loss of OHCs is the leading cause of hearing loss, and hence their regeneration could be the most valuable
means to restore hearing. In the first cycle of this grant, we found that the zinc-finger protein INSM1, expressed
in nascent OHCs, acts during a brief critical period of their early development to consolidate their fate,
preventing OHCs from transdifferentiating into IHCs. In the absence of INSM1, OHCs are born properly
specified but, within a couple of days, nearly half of them cease expressing OHC markers and proceed to
transdifferentiate into IHCs. We hypothesize that INSM1 consolidates the fate of OHCs by modifying their
epigenome, closing regulatory elements required for IHC differentiation. To test this and alternative
hypotheses, we will perform ATAC-seq on developing OHCs with and without INSM1 (which are susceptible to
transdifferentiate into IHCs) as well as in IHCs ectopically expressing INSM1. In the previous funding cycle, we
also found that the distribution of transdifferentiated hair cells varies in a graded fashion along the neural to
abneural axis, suggesting that INSM1 normally consolidates the OHC fate by preventing their responding to an
IHC-inducing morphogen. In order to identify such a morphogen, which presumably determines the IHC vs
OHC distribution in the cochlea, we will culture mutant organs of Corti and alter their extent of
transdifferentiation with agonists and antagonists of candidate morphogens and their signaling pathways.
These studies use the transdifferentiation of OHCs into IHCs as a novel means for elucidating the molecular
mechanisms (chromatin modifications, morphogens, and resulting gene expression) by which the
complementary IHCs and OHCs are generated in the developing cochlea. Finally, in the previous funding cycle
we identified an OHC-specific transcriptions factor, BCL11b which, together with its paralog BCL11a, is
necessary for the precise alignment of OHCs in parallel rows and with stereocilia pointing perpendicular to the
reticular lamina, essential features for their function as cochlear amplifiers. We will explore how BCL11b+a
achieve this task by genetic, anatomical, physiological, transcriptomic and epigenomic examinations, the same
approaches we are or already have successfully employed with INSM1. We predict that the studies here
proposed will provide an unprecedented advance in understanding how OHCs form, and align themselves, so
as to serve their role in hearing."
10889092,"In 2020, 20M adults living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are estimated to be receiving
first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) and this is expected to increase to 23.6M by 2024. This increase in access
to first-line ART will have a cascade effect on the number of patients prescribed alternative, second-line protease-
inhibitor (PI)-based ART following first-line ART failure. Studies of patients on PI-based ART have shown high
rates of virologic failure at 12 and 24 months on ART, and patients maintained on failing PI-based regimens
accumulate drug resistance mutations (DRMs) that hamper current and future treatment options. Despite calls
for improved access to HIVDR diagnostics, the persistent urgent and unmet need for resistance genotyping has
not been met, prohibiting the appropriate allocation of expensive third-line ART options. Early identification of
second-line ART patients unable to achieve virologic suppression in the absence of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR)
is crucial to prevent disease progression and curb HIV transmission. When virologic failure is adherence-
mediate, third-line ART is unlikely to improve patient outcomes, while increasing healthcare system costs, and
prematurely restricting future treatment options. Aldatu’s pioneering technology, PANDAA, uses adaptation to
enable qPCR for DRM genotyping despite the high genomic variability of HIV. Our Phase II award preceding this
CRP used PANDAA to successfully develop the first diagnostic for simultaneous focused genotyping of six
resistance-conferring positions in the protease gene, and the K65R and M184VI DRMs. PANDAA accurately
genotypes DRMs present ≥10% where conventional qPCR fails, with excellent sensitivity: as few as 100 DRM
copies detected reproducibly even with allelic variants with known mismatches in the probe-binding sites. In this
CRP, we build upon our recent product commercialization experience in the USA to create a diagnostic product
for marketing and sale in LMICs. In the first year we will expand our existing quality management system (QMS)
to be compliant with international standard for medical device manufacturing. This will align our manufacturing
processes to achieve CE marking as an in vitro diagnostic (IVD). Concurrent with the establishment of our QMS
we will expand our in-house manufacturing practices such that by the end of the second year we will have the
capacity for the GMP production of ≥800, CE IVD HIVDR genotyping tests per a week in an ISO 134585-certified
facility. This will be coordinated with implementing our go-to-market strategy to introduce the product in 3-5 short
list countries, and we will have identified and vetted clinical study partners, distributors, and other regional
partners to support Aldatu in negotiations and contracting with local partners and facilitating engagement with
Ministries of Health. Our go-to-market launch will be preceded by early site evaluations by collaborators in key
target markets where they will perform side-by-side comparisons with Sanger sequencing and evaluate our
software. The net result will be the manufacturing and regulatory qualification of an HIVDR genotyping diagnostic
that significantly reduces test complexity, time burden and costs, without sacrificing accuracy."

 This collaborative project, between McLean Hospital, Harvard Medical School, USA and Cape Town
University, South Africa, proposes to investigate the biological mechanisms underlying effects of maternal
stress on infant development. Prospective, longitudinal, mother-child cohort studies have found that children
exposed to maternal psychological stress, depression, or anxiety during the prenatal period have higher risk for
behavioral and emotional problems later in life, including increased fearfulness, anxiety, and depression. We
propose to examine RNA-mediated epigenetic factors in this proposal. We recently found that adults with
comorbid PTSD and/or Depression (PTSD/MDD) have reduced expression of the DICER1 gene, which plays a
central role in stress-related pathways by controlling ncRNA expression. Additional new work from our group
has shown differential expression of a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), GAS5, which directly regulates
glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity, in recently traumatized adults as a predictor of later PTSD development.
lncRNAs regulate expression of more than half of all protein-coding genes post-transcriptionally in the body.
This study will extend our adult PTSD findings of DICER1, GAS5 and other lncRNA pathways, to elucidate
mechanisms underlying transmission of risk across generations using an integrative developmental model in
the Drakenstein mother/infant cohort. In aim 1, we will focus on in utero developmental RNA profiles. We will
examine lncRNA and lncRNA-mediated epigenetic effects at birth, in infants exposed in utero to maternal
PTSD/MDD by investigating RNAs that are altered in both mothers with PTSD/MDD and their infants in the
Drakenstein mother/infant cohort (N=450). In aim 2, we will focus on early life developmental RNA profiles. We
will examine longitudinal stability of lncRNA-mediated epigenetic factors associated with exposure to maternal
PTSD/MDD at birth and at age 2 and 5 years. We will identify lncRNA-based factors that are persistently
altered in exposed infants at birth across age 5 to elucidate the effects of maternal stress during early life
development, which may prelude to manifestation of negative outcomes later in life. In aim 3, we will focus on
early life RNA profiles and subsequent behavioral-developmental outcomes. We will identify the effects of RNA
profiles at birth, age 2 and 5 years on behavioral and developmental measures at ages 2, 3.5 and 5 years. In
utero and environmentally induced changes in expression levels of RNA-mediated epigenetic factors may
predict development of behavioral and emotional problems. Through each of these aims, the proposal will build
research capacity through training, site visits, collaborative data analyses, publications, and presentations.
Through collaboration between the low- and middle-income country (LMIC) and upper- and middle-income
country (UMIC) institutions we will lay foundation via infrastructure and collection of unique phenotypes and
RNA-sequencing data for future studies of this unique mother-child cohort in the LMIC, advancing our
understanding of risk and child development."

This career development award, Acupuncture for Cognitive Health in Older Survivors of Prostate Cancer
(ACHIEVE), will train Dr. Liou to become an independent clinician-investigator with expertise in integrative
therapies for cognitive health and symptom management in prostate cancer (PC) survivors. BACKGROUND:
By 2030, PC survivors are expected to become the largest group of cancer survivors in the United States.
Cancer-related cognitive dysfunction (CRCD) is a significant concern in this growing population, but evidence-
based treatments are lacking. Most CRCD studies in PC have focused on the neuro-toxicities of androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT). However, the literature on the association between ADT and CRCD remains mixed,
suggesting other factors may play a role in CRCD. Growing research from other populations demonstrates that
co-morbid symptoms (anxiety, depression, fatigue, insomnia, nocturia) may contribute to cognitive dysfunction.
These symptoms are prevalent among PC survivors, but their role in CRCD remains poorly understood in the
PC population. Expanding CRCD research beyond the non-modifiable factors (prior ADT exposure) and
focusing on modifiable factors (co-morbid symptoms) has the potential to inform novel treatments approaches
for CRCD. Based on Dr. Liou’s preliminary studies, acupuncture improves objective CRCD directly, but it may
improve subjective CRCD indirectly through co-morbid symptoms. Informed by this prior work, Dr. Liou will test
a novel acupuncture intervention that directly targets CRCD with the optionality to jointly address symptoms
co-occurring with CRCD. RESEARCH: Dr. Liou will evaluate the association between co-morbid symptoms
and CRCD in a cross-sectional study of PC survivors (Aim 1). Dr. Liou will then evaluate the feasibility and
preliminary effects of acupuncture for CRCD and co-morbid symptoms in a pilot randomized controlled trial of
PC survivors (Aim 2). CAREER DEVELOPMENT: Dr. Liou will acquire competence in CRCD evaluation, PC
symptom science, clinical trial design, biostatistics, and grant-writing. His training will be supported by
mentorship, coursework, independent study, workshops, conferences, and preparation of manuscripts and
grants. MENTORS: Dr. Liou will be mentored by a team of internationally-recognized researchers with
complementary expertise in CRCD, neuropsychological assessment, PC symptom science, integrative
medicine, oncology acupuncture, clinical trial design, biostatistics, and PC medicine. ENVIRONMENT:
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center will provide the institutional support and resources for the research.
IMPACT: The proposed studies have potential to advance multi-factorial understanding of CRCD and expand
non-pharmacological treatment options for prevalent symptoms affecting the aging PC population. Dr. Liou will
acquire the preliminary data to support a competitive R01 grant application to test the efficacy of acupuncture
for CRCD and comorbid symptoms in PC survivors. This award will establish the foundation for an independent
research program with sustained impact in PC survivorship care, cognitive health, and integrative oncology."

Developed in the 1950s, Thalidomide was used to treat morning sickness in the early stages of pregnancy, which
led to the birth of thousands of children with severe birth defects and subsequent withdrawal from the market.
Today, thalidomide and its analogs lenalidomide and pomalidomide (collectively known as IMiDs) are FDA
approved drugs and effective treatments for hematologic malignancies such as multiple myeloma and Del(5q)
MDS. But despite over 60 years of research, the mechanistic understanding of how these molecules cause the
characteristic birth defects is only just beginning to unravel. Due to the wide use of IMiDs in the clinic, and the
recent explosion in the development of targeted protein degradation therapies based often on the original
thalidomide scaffold, it is more critical than ever that we understand the full range of potential activities that IMiDs
provoke. Here, we propose to explore the broad range of potential activities that result from these IMiD-like
molecules binding to the E3 ligase CUL4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (CRL4CRBN) and redirecting its activity towards
different targets. Specifically, in aim 1, we will engineer an in vivo mouse model of Sall4 degradation to dissect
how thalidomide-mediated degradation of Sall4 leads to teratogenicity. We will do this through a combination of
expression analyses and developmental measurements to assess the affect that IMiD molecules have on the
developing embryo. This will not only enable the study of the mechanism of teratogenic activity of these drugs
but will also provide a critical model system for testing the toxicity of current and future versions of these
molecules. Not only do these molecules induce a gain-of-function to target new proteins, but they also induce a
loss-of-function and in aim 2, we propose to use novel mass spectrometry-based proteomics technology in
combination with potent and selective tool compounds to explore the biological consequences of blocking CRBN
activity. We have previously shown that we can expand the scope of IMiD targets through rational design of new
IMiD-like molecules capable of degrading new proteins related to known targets. In aim 3, we propose to expand
the target scope even further by developing novel chemistry to target structurally diverse proteins that have a
strong therapeutic rationale, thus providing proof-of-concept for target expansion and providing chemical leads
for new therapeutic targets. The overarching goal of this grant is to explore the full range of potential activities of
the widely utilized CRL4CRBN ligase by identifying and exploring the mechanistic consequences of degrading its
physiological and IMiD-induced targets, as well as seeking to expand its target space into currently undruggable
territories."

Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is a devastating and prevalent cancer of the liver with high rates of mortality.
Major risk factors include chronic viral infection (hepatitis B or C), fatty liver disease, alcohol use, and exposure
to environmental toxins. An independent risk factor is a family history of HCC, which raises the risk by more than
2.5-fold. However, despite evidence of familial risk, the inherited component remains unknown. It also remains
unexplored whether inherited gene variants play a pathogenic role in HCC development, or whether they could
be used to guide treatment with targeted therapies. We have pioneered an investigation into inherited (i.e.
germline) genetic factors associated with HCC. We have completed a pilot analysis of 217 patients with HCC
prospectively enrolled from our medical center for clinical-grade multigene panel genetic testing. We have
captured details about their personal and family cancer history, risk factors, and outcomes. In our pilot analysis,
we found a surprisingly high rate of pathogenic germline variants in cancer-associated genes in patients with
HCC, including numerous pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in genes required for homologous repair,
DNA damage response (HR-DDR). We hypothesize that inherited loss-of-function variants in specific genes are
enriched in HCC, and that carriers can be treated with targeted therapies. In Aim 1, we will conduct genetic
association studies that are powered to detect clinically meaningful germline variants linked to HCC, and we will
examine predictors of hereditary cancer syndromes in HCC including age of onset and family history of cancer.
In Aim 2, we will explore the mechanism of HCC arising from defects in HR-DDR genes, and determine the
implications for targeted therapies. These innovative studies of the hereditary genetics of HCC have the potential
to personalize therapies for the subset of patients with hereditary cancer syndromes. We have assembled a
team of experts in HCC, hereditary genetics, and animal models to complete this investigation. This study has
the potential to impact on the care of patients with HCC in the US and worldwide."
10889107,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Enteric bacterial infections remain one of the greatest public health challenges worldwide and deciphering the
mechanisms that protect against infection will enable development of new treatments. Intestinal tissues are in
constant direct contact with diverse beneficial and pathogenic microbes, highlighting the need for orchestrating
complex microbial signals to sustain protection against infection. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) reside at the
direct interface between intestinal pathogens, beneficial commensal bacteria, and intestinal immune
components. However, despite continuous exposure to diverse microbes, the mechanisms regulating how IECs
integrate microbial-derived signals to mount protective host responses to pathogens are not well understood.
The goals of this proposal are to interrogate how specific commensal bacterial-derived metabolites are sensed
by IECs to protect against pathogenic infection. Employing Citrobacter rodentium, a murine model of human
enteropathogenic Escherichia coli infection, our studies have identified that microbiota-derived products protect
against intestinal damage and enteric bacterial infection. Our epigenetic analyses for this project led to
identification of new commensal bacterial-derived metabolites that can directly regulate IECs and prime host
defense against pathogenic bacterial infection. Employing an exciting array of transgenic animals, pathogenic
and commensal bacterial strains, and human intestinal organoids, three specific aims are proposed that will (i)
decipher how the host calibrates intestinal barrier function by sensing newly-identified commensal bacterial-
derived metabolites, (ii) investigate metabolite-dependent regulation of enteric infection, and (iii) interrogate how
metabolism of dietary components by commensal bacteria prime the epigenome and enhance host response to
pathogenic bacteria. Defining pathways that integrate commensal and pathogenic signals will provide a
framework to test the therapeutic potential of manipulating commensal bacterial-derived metabolites to promote
antibacterial immunity."
10889162,"SUMMARY ABSTRACT
 Although cervical cancer is an easily curable disease if detected early, it continues to claim the lives of
hundreds of thousands of women worldwide. Healthcare disparities have resulted in cervical cancer incidence
and mortality that are five times higher in low and middle income countries (LMICs) than in high-income countries.
In the United States, cervical cancer mortality rates are twice as high among rural women than their urban
counterparts. The wide disparity in cervical cancer incidence rates and deaths is attributed to both higher HPV
infection rates and a lack of accessible screening and treatment of pre-invasive cervical lesions.
 The current standard of care in the US, a cytology-based Pap smear, requires resource intensive laboratory
and clinical specialists with a long turnaround time from sample collection to result. Alternatives, such as visual
inspection with acetic acid and emerging HPV-targeted tests, have poor specificity for cervical cancer, leading
to overtreatment that can cause complications including infertility and pre-term births and that further the burden
on limited healthcare resources. This proposal aims to create an integrated point-of-care screening test that can
be used by healthcare providers in under-resourced settings to obtain relevant clinical insights, including cervical
cancer risk stratification, and enable same-visit treatment of high risk cervical lesions.
 Building on our preliminary development of a highly sensitive paper-based immunoassay to test for the key
cervical cancer biomarker, valosin containing protein (VCP), the objective of this proposal is to combine VCP
detection with three other known cervical cancer protein biomarkers, in a sensitive and specific single-step point-
of-care assay.
 Specific milestones include:
 1) Integrating and optimizing multiplex detection of cervical cancer biomarkers into a simple paper-based
sample-to-answer device.
 2) Evaluating the operational and performance metrics of the test in retrospective cervical swab samples.
 The outcome of this proposal will be a highly characterized point-of-care test with high sensitivity (95%) and
specificity (90%) to detect high-risk cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cervical cancer within 40
minutes. This affordable solution for cervical cancer screening and control programs will be applicable in LMICs
and will provide highly sensitive monitoring of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in the US, where it will be
especially impactful in high-risk populations that are currently underserved by existing screening programs."
10889163,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed research and career development plan aim to provide the candidate with the knowledge,
experience, and resources necessary to become an independent neurosurgeon-scientist whose research
reduces stroke and neurologic disability after neurosurgery through the design and implementation of machine
learning (ML) and computer vision (CV) systems that provide surgeons with feedback to improve surgical
performance. After formal training, practicing neurosurgeons receive little feedback and instead learn by
experience accrued during procedures. However, most do not accrue sufficient case volume to achieve optimal
outcomes in every procedure. Ultimately, >16,000 patients are harmed by preventable neurosurgical errors
each year, resulting in stroke and neurologic disability in up to 70% and death in up to 16% of affected
patients. Unfortunately, the study of harmful adverse events during surgery is obstructed by a lack of datasets
containing surgical actions leading up to adverse events or outcomes. The candidate proposes to overcome
this limitation by using advanced CV and ML methods to analyze a previously unstudied, multimodal dataset
combining pituitary surgical video and clinical data. Pituitary surgery is performed >10,000 times annually in
the U.S., can be recorded for analysis, and its steps, errors, and adverse events were recently standardized in
an international consensus statement. Specifically, the candidate will test the central hypothesis that the
interaction of visible surgeon skill factors with visualized features, including patient anatomy and disease
pathology, produces identifiable step-specific surgical errors that result in postoperative stroke, neurologic
disability, and other adverse events. Specific Aims: 1) Use CV to identify step-specific errors (defined by tool
usage, step progression, and phase characteristics) preceding adverse events; 2) Train ML models to predict
upcoming adverse events from prior metrics of surgeon skill and current visual features of the surgical field.
Methods to identify high-risk neurosurgical actions, predict upcoming adverse events from a surgeon’s
movements, and retrospectively highlight critical timepoints and visual features associated with adverse events
are necessary to rationally design and implement interventions to reduce stroke, neurologic disability, and
other adverse events. The feasibility and success of this work will be facilitated by the candidate’s outstanding
mentoring team, including a surgeon-scientist with experience conducting CV-based surgical performance
assessments from procedural visual data and experts in ML using medical image and clinical data, biomedical
applications of deep learning in complex prediction models, and multi-institutional pituitary surgical research. In
the final year of the award, the candidate will apply for an R01 award to prospectively implement generalizable
predictive models (developed in Aim 2) using a larger dataset of videos from several surgical procedures and
to develop methods to collect and act upon data from operative video in real-time."

The overall goal of the METALS Community Engagement Core (CEC) is to direct prevention and intervention
strategies to ensure that residents and leaders of our partner communities are involved in every step of the
research at the community level and that researchers are engaged in and with the communities. CEC
synergizes Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and Western Scientific methods to increase understanding
of multiple-pathway exposures to abandoned uranium mine (AUM) wastes and inform strategies to reduce
releases of hazardous substances – such as uranium, vanadium, arsenic and other metals -- thereby reducing
human exposures. Our current community partners are Blue Gap-Tachee Chapter of the Navajo Nation in
northeastern AZ; Pueblo of Laguna, N.M.; and Red Water Pond Road Community Association on the Navajo
Nation near Gallup, NM. A new community partner – the Cameron Agricultural Ad Hoc Committee (CAAHC), a
project of Cameron Chapter of the Navajo Nation – joined the METALS SRP as a result of a long history of
collaborations with METALS partner Southwest Research and Information Center (SRIC). All four are impacted
by AUMs that date back to the 1950s, range in size from a few acres to 2,700 acres (the Jackpile open-pit
mine on Laguna Pueblo), and have had varying levels of remediation, from virtually none to measures that
reduce immediate safety hazards at the mine sites, but are lacking long-term control of waste piles and
hazardous substances releases. Like the Pueblo of Laguna, CAAHC is developing farming in an area
surrounded by abandoned uranium mines (AUMs) and is concerned about impacts of the AUMs on the safety
of crops grown on the farmlands. CEC collaborates with the METALS environmental projects to collect
meteorological and particulate matter (PM) data to inform air-dispersion modeling and toxicity assessments of
submicron dust particles, and with the biomedical projects to assist in conducting health surveys and
biospecimen collections among community members to assess their exposures to toxic trace metals. Staff of
SRIC and METALS partner Indigenous Education Institute form the CEC’s Indigenous Science Team (IST) that
works closely with these communities, linking them with UNM researchers in the environmental and biological
sciences and research translation. The IST will hold quarterly webinars featuring Native scholars discussing
how principles of Indigenous Science can be applied to remediation of abandoned uranium mines to
supplement innovative remediation strategies proposed by METALS Project ESE Remed and the routine
clean-up methods proffered by USEPA under authority of the Superfund law. Online workshops on
remediation science and policy will empower our community partners to be full participants in remediation
decisions by federal and tribal regulatory agencies. The webinars will aim to create a space for collaborative
design processes, TEK formulations, and place-based strategies for reducing impacts to community partners’
agricultural lands and water. In this work, CEC addresses NIEHS SRP mandates 2 and 4."

Interdisciplinary research training is a vital component to the development of the next generation of
environmental health science professionals. The Research Experience and Training Coordination Core
(RETCC) of the UNM METALS Center has been established to coordinate graduate and postdoctoral level
cross-disciplinary research experiences and training in fields related to biomedical research and environmental
science and engineering research. The RETCC is designed to address gaps in the interdisciplinary training
experiences of the various academic departments at UNM, to give our trainees broader perspectives of their
work in the context of our regional environmental health issues. Among the major activities for our program, we
include a cultural sensitivity workshop to help guide our trainees as they conduct research in Native American
communities. We have provided both practical research experiences/opportunities on tribal lands as well as
provided experiences in written and oral research communication with our regional communities. In the next
phase of our METALS Superfund program, we will further expand on initiatives developed in the first phase.
Beyond our workshops and journal clubs, we will also promote tailored curricula development, innovative,
cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional laboratory experiences, engagement in seminar series, workshops/
conferences related to professional development, and of course travel to scientific meetings. The UNM
METALS program represents a vital resource in this regard, as our efforts already bring together trainees from
diverse academic foci to execute interdisciplinary research. The next phase of the RETCC will forward the
following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Organize educational programs to promote effective research with
indigenous communities. As a crucial aspect of scientific training in the UNM METALS Superfund Center,
trainees have the opportunity to learn cultural sensitivity, advanced scientific communication modalities, and
different approaches for effectively engaging communities, leadership, regulatory agencies and other
stakeholders in environmental health research. Specific Aim 2. Provide interdisciplinary research education to
span the gaps between vital academic disciplines to enhance environmental health research. Specific Aim 3.
Promote the career development of a next generation of environmental health researchers. Through
coordinated scientific exchange with other Superfund Centers, grantsmanship training, attendance at regional,
national, and international conferences, and nontraditional experiential training we will ensure that the UNM
METALS trainees have exceptional long-term career opportunities in the field of environmental health
research. Specific Aim 4. Provide all METALS members – trainees and faculty – access to resources to ensure
quality scientific mentoring and career development tools. Specific Aim 5. Implement a comprehensive
evaluation process with formative and summative components for assessment of UNM METALS trainees, their
mentors, and the overall RETCC program."
10890073,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of mortality in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD),
accounting for 55% of total deaths. In particular, sudden cardiac death poses the greatest threat to the
dialysis population. A diagnosis of heart failure (HF), a highly prevalent complication that is associated with
an 80% mortality rate within three years in chronic dialysis patients, is a powerful predictor of sudden death
in ESKD. A clustering of metabolic and myocardial abnormalities, including insulin resistance, impaired
myocardial bioenergetics, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), myocardial fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction,
mediates development of HF and increases the risk of sudden death in ESKD. Regrettably, therapeutic
options to ameliorate the CV risk remain very limited in ESKD. Development of novel and effective
interventions to reduce HF risk and death, therefore, represents one of the greatest unmet needs for the
dialysis population. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), a novel class of oral hypoglycemic
medications that reduce glucose reabsorption in the renal proximal tubule, have recently demonstrated
unprecedented efficacy to reduce HF hospitalization and CV deaths in patients with and without type 2
diabetes. Emerging data suggest that the benefits of SGLT2is include their efficacy to mitigate insulin
resistance, enhance mitochondrial oxidative capacity in the heart, reverse LVH and improve diastolic
dysfunction, and reduce cardiac fibrosis. Given that these CV benefits are hypothesized to be downstream
consequences of renal SGLT2 inhibition (i.e. glycosuria and natriuresis), clinical trials have excluded those
with advanced renal failure. There is compelling evidence, however, that SGLT2is may have direct effects
on myocardium, independent of its action on the kidney, to restore myocardial electrophysiologic balance,
enhance mitochondrial function, and reduce fibrosis, with a potential to reverse LVH and prevent HF and
arrhythmia. These data raise a crucial question if SGLT2is may improve survival in ESKD. In order to
perform a full-scale clinical trial to evaluate the CV and survival benefits of SGLT2is in ESKD, a pilot study is
required to assess preliminary safety, tolerability, and feasibility. We hence propose a randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm pilot study in 75 chronic hemodialysis participants to evaluate (1) safety and
tolerability of empagliflozin, a selective SGLT2 inhibitor, including a steady-state pharmacokinetic (PK) study
of two different daily doses and (2) feasibility of conducting a full-scale clinical trial. Our proposal is the first
study to evaluate safety and tolerability of a SGLT2i in ESKD to date, including a detailed PK study of two
doses to examine the effect of chronic administration. Positive findings will (1) provide the necessary
preliminary safety, tolerability, and feasibility data to plan a larger, multi-center clinical trial in ESKD, and (2)
promote future studies to investigate the efficacy of SGLT2is to provide myocardial and metabolic benefits,
which may lead to a paradigm shift in the management of CV risk in ESKD."

About 60% of children can’t read proficiently, which is concerning as reading comprehension (RC) is linked to
educational, vocational, and health outcomes. While a robust neurocognitive literature exists on word-level
processes, a necessary but not sufficient skill for RC, similar studies at the discourse level (i.e., while reading
passages/connected text) are largely absent in developing readers. This proposal tackles this needed research
by systematically interrogating how adolescents’ neural variations during situation model formation (or building
mental models while reading) results in RC success/failure. A critical consideration for such research is that
texts are not monolithic, even though they are often treated as such: they vary by granular text features (e.g.,
word frequency) and by their superstructures, or whether a text is narrative (NarrT, stories) or expository
(ExpT, informational text such as science passages). This is important, as ExpT is central for learning new
material, while NarrT for socio-emotional growth. Notably, NarrT RC is easier than ExpT RC, a phenomenon
which is poorly understood and not explained by granular text feature differences. Building upon our initial
neurocognitive findings, along with existing theoretical and empirical work, we use neuroimaging coupled with
behavioral methods to garner insights as to where (in the brain), when (at which text junctures), and thus how
NarrT vs ExpT RC breaks down. Initial findings suggest that while both NarrT and ExpT rely on shared
neurocognitive processes, they have distinctions that may be key for enhancing RC. NarrT uniquely relies on
regions in a neural network linked to socio-emotional processes (e.g., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex), while
ExpT uniquely relies on regions in a neural network that supports executive function/cognitive control (e.g., left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Our overarching hypothesis is that readers’ use of SocEMDMN vs FPN is a critical
determinant of proficient situation model formation, and, thus, RC. We also posit that the enhanced socio-
emotional NarrT context provokes greater connectivity between DisPDMN and SocEMDMN at key junctures in text,
resulting in enriched intrinsic access to readers’ internal states, and thus a neurocognitive benefit for RC.
Critically, pilot findings suggest that this enhanced socioemotional context can also be achieved in ExpT by
embedding high emotion words [words with high arousal ratings] in ExpT, perhaps paving the way to bolster
ExpT RC. Given that RC is a central avenue for learning new information after ~3rd grade, we are addressing a
highly significant public health issue. To systematically test our hypotheses, we target 10-12 yo (N=220) who
have crossed into the “reading to learn” stage to examine dynamic neural processes of ExpT vs NarrT online
reading (situation model building; Aim 1); how readers’ individual differences (e.g., executive function, socio-
emotional) modulate Aim 1’s findings (Aim 2); how Aims 1 & 2’s neural findings predict RC (Aim 3a); and, if
enhancing the socioemotional context helps RC (Aim 3b). Our ultimate goal is to identify the best ways
adolescents learn new information while reading so as to maximize academic success and prevent RC failure."
10890097,"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Copper-Dependent Nutrient Signaling and Metabolism
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Akin to organic nutrients, such as oxygen, lipids, amino acids, and carbohydrates, the transition metal copper
(Cu) is an essential dietary nutrient for normal physiology and development. Decades of research highlight the
physiological and disease associated consequences of disrupting homeostatic mechanisms that ensure proper
Cu acquisition, storage, and distribution to Cu-dependent enzymes. However, phenotypes associated with
alterations in Cu availability cannot be fully explained by the limited number of enzymes that traditionally harness
the redox potential of Cu as a catalytic cofactor. Recent discoveries in Cu biology have revealed direct Cu binding
at non-catalytic sites within signaling molecules that modulate cell proliferation via the protein kinases MEK1/2,
lipid metabolism via the phosphodiesterase PDE3B, and nutrient recycling via the autophagic kinases ULK1/2.
The emergence of this new paradigm in nutrient sensing and protein regulation has established that Cu is a
critical mediator of intracellular signaling, provided evidence for the existence of molecular mechanisms for
sensing changes in Cu abundance, and expanded the contribution of Cu to cellular processes necessary for
adaptation to nutrient scarcity. This grant proposal will focus on the intersections between Cu homeostasis,
nutrient signaling, and metabolism by examining the interplay between mechanisms of Cu-sensing necessary
for cellular energy homeostasis and evaluating the necessity of Cu for metabolic flexibility under nutrient and
oxygen stress. Specifically, we will build on our novel findings from the past 5 years by elucidating mechanisms
of: i) Cu-controlled autophagy-lysosomal biogenesis and function, ii) Cu-mediated metabolic flexibility via direct
control of glycolytic flux, and iii) interconnectivity between mitochondrial Cu transport and cytosolic nutrient
sensing signaling pathways necessary for metabolism. By launching these three interconnected focus areas, we
will increase our fundamental knowledge of the molecular and cellular features of Cu-dependent enzymes
and cellular processes and enable therapeutic targeting of Cu-dependent disease vulnerabilities."
10890203,"Project Summary
Social attachment is fundamental to our daily lives and is disrupted in various psychiatric disorders. However,
development of new therapeutic options for enhancing social attachment has been hampered by our imprecise
understanding of the underlying cellular and circuit mechanisms. At the heart of neural circuits underlying
social attachment is the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and recent work by my thesis lab, investigating pair
bonding in monogamous prairie voles, suggests that individual neurons of the NAc encode for partner-
associated social interaction.
 In a series of new analyses focused on how populations of neurons encode for pair bonding, I found
that neurons exhibited synchronous activity as a function of pair bond formation. Further analyses suggest that
inhibitory interneurons, which provide a powerful source of inhibition within the NAc, may coordinate this
synchrony between neurons. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to examine precisely how NAc interneurons
encode pair bonds, and to test whether NAc interneurons are necessary for bond-induced neuronal synchrony
and for pair bond formation. This project will leverage cutting-edge methods for both observing and
manipulating NAc interneurons and would provide the first interneuron-specific insights into how the prairie
vole NAc facilitates pair bonding.
 Together, the experiments in this proposal will expand our fundamental understanding of how social
attachment is supported at the cellular level within the nucleus accumbens. This work will also provide the
applicant with invaluable training for his future career as a pediatric neurologist focused on translating
foundational knowledge from cellular and circuits neuroscience into novel, highly precise therapies for social
dysfunction."

Candida albicans causes half of all invasive fungal infections in humans. It adheres to indwelling medical devices
and develops into drug resistant multilayered community of cells called biofilms, which serve as a reservoir of
continuing infections. While host response to mucosal and disseminated candidiasis is well studied, little is
known on the immune response to C. albicans biofilms on catheters. We hypothesize that discovering virulence
factors of biofilm cells, and delineation of the host immune response to the biofilm, can inform therapeutic
strategies aimed at attenuation of biofilm-associated disseminated candidiasis in the host. For this we will use a
rat central venous catheter model of biofilm infection. To understand the biofilm environment of catheter- infected
cardiovascular tissue, we will utilize a new technology called Visium 10X Spatial Genomics, that provides a
spatial “atlas” of all genes (host and pathogen) expressed during an active infection that can be visualized and
analyzed simultaneously, without compromising tissue architecture. Following this, role of certain genes and
proteins will be validated in in vitro, and ex vivo assays using endothelial cell lines, by immunohistochemistry,
and evaluated in vivo for their role in biofilm clearance.
Furthermore, we will assess the efficacy of two repurposed FDA-approved small molecules (that have previously
demonstrated activity in mucosal models), for their promise as anti-biofilm drugs. Indeed, biomarkers of host
response identified from aim 1 will be measured post drug treatment, to correlate eradication of infection with
the host response. Overall, our studies will unearth the host response to central venous catheter associated
biofilms, and investigate the potency of two promising compounds in eradicating biofilms."

 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occurs in over 15 million adults in the US. As many as
35% of those patients develop pulmonary vascular disease (PVD), but the recommendations for assessment
and management of PVD in COPD have been limited by key knowledge gaps. Firstly, assessment of the
pulmonary vasculature has relied upon invasive right heart catheterization as the gold standard, limiting studies
to select populations with severe PVD. Noninvasive techniques, though widely available, have also been
primarily validated in populations with severe PVD applying markers that are likely to reflect end-stage PVD,
such as right ventricular failure. As a result, another key knowledge gap is the unknown contribution of PVD to
COPD morbidity across its observed spectrum of severity. While the concomitant presence of severe PVD is
observed to portend increased morbidity and mortality compared to those with COPD alone, the contribution of
less severe PVD, at potentially more intervenable points in the disease course is less well-understood. This
proposal seeks to address these knowledge gaps in three aims by (SA1) testing the diagnostic accuracy of
three noninvasive markers that are selected for plausible sensitivity to early PVD, (SA2) and applying these
noninvasive markers to understand the contribution of PVD to respiratory morbidity in cross-sectional and
(SA3) longitudinal study designs. This application will add noninvasive markers to a general COPD cohort
unselected for PVD and will further assemble a prospective longitudinal cohort of COPD patients enriched for
PVD with the same noninvasive testing. The results of this proposal will identify novel noninvasive approaches
for assessing PVD, define their clinical relevance across the spectrum of PVD, and establish opportunities to
study the use of noninvasive markers as candidate outcomes in clinical trials targeting the pulmonary
vasculature to manage COPD.
 Dr. Balasubramanian’s proposal is a strong training vehicle for her career development, offering her
skills in hands-on cohort study design and execution, advanced biostatistical and epidemiologic methodology,
and noninvasive and invasive assessment of PVD in COPD through numerous modalities including right heart
catheterization, magnetic resonance imaging, speckle-tracking echocardiography, and physiologic
measurements of diffusing capacity of the lung. Dr. Balasubramanian will be supported by a strong multi-
disciplinary mentorship team with expertise in COPD, pulmonary hypertension, cardiology, radiology, and
biostatistics. She further will leverage an exceptional institutional environment with its collaborative and
supportive culture, extensive intellectual and physical resources, and strong history of supporting junior
investigators. This award will establish Dr. Balasubramanian as an independent investigator with a unique
research niche, distinct from her mentorship team, and establish a foundation for future studies evaluating and
managing PVD in COPD."
10871912,"Summary
Approximately 30% of U.S. adults suffer from tendon and ligament injuries, which frequently occur near
insertion sites into bone (i.e., entheses) and do not spontaneously heal. Growth and development studies have
demonstrated a critical role for hedgehog (Hh) signaling in driving zonal enthesis formation but it's role in adult
enthesis repair is largely unknown. Zonal enthesis formation involves anchoring collagen fibers, synthesizing
proteoglycan-rich fibrocartilage, and mineralizing this fibrocartilage. Hh promotes this fibrocartilage formation.
Unfortunately, studying this pathway in traditional tendon-to-bone repair has been a challenge since these
repair models do not sufficiently anchor collagen fibers to bone, much less produce zones of fibrocartilage.
Conversely, ligament reconstructions, where a tendon graft is placed through bone tunnels, can produce zonal
attachments. Therefore, ligament reconstruction models, such as the anterior cruciate reconstruction model
proposed in this application, can be employed to study the mechanisms that regulate zonal tendon-to-bone
repair in the adult. This proposal will address this gap in knowledge by targeting the hedgehog pathway
genetically and pharmacologically during tendon-to-bone repair following ACL reconstruction in novel
transgenic mouse models. We will define the roles of the hedgehog pathway in specific stages of the repair
response from the expansion of the progenitor pool to production of fibrocartilage and bone within zonal
tendon-to-bone attachments during the tunnel integration process. By modulating the pathway
pharmacologically, we will determine the potential for this pathway to be targeted in a translational fashion that
could lead to novel therapies in the future. Our central hypothesis is that the Hh pathway is a critical positive
regulator of zonal enthesis formation in the adult and therefore stimulation of the pathway will improve tendon-
to-bone repair."

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and escalating health care costs within the
VA. The type of HF that is increasing disproportionately is HF with a preserved ejection fraction
(HFpEF), commonly caused by left ventricular (LV) pressure overload (LVPO). A cornerstone of
HFpEF is LV diastolic dysfunction and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, in which these structural
changes are not readily reversible. A critical pathway for ECM remodeling is post-transcriptional
regulation by the microRNAs (miRs). The guiding hypothesis of this collaborative program is that a
specific and quantifiable shift in a specific miR profile, which regulate key ECM processes and can be
identified in both HFpEF patients and a large animal model of HFpEF, is predictive for exercise
response and attenuation of HFpEF progression and mechanistically directs phenotype
reprogramming of HFpEF myocardial fibroblasts. The integrative project outcomes include
establishing new molecular tools with improved precision to detect onset and attenuate the
progression of HFpEF as well as identify novel therapeutic targets for Veterans suffering from this
devastating HF syndrome. In this project, a large animal model of LVPO induced HFpEF will be utilized
in order to perform functional (LV regional myocardial stiffness) and exercise studies as well as miR
profiling. The guiding hypothesis is that a setpoint shift in a cassette of miRs that regulate the
ECM/fibroblast activation process causes a refractory form of HFpEF, defined by a persistent HFpEF
phenotype despite removal of the LVPO stimulus. In a parallel set of studies, it will be demonstrated that
a standardized exercise regimen will prevent the emergence of this profibrotic miR signature and in turn
refractory HFpEF. These studies will provide the foundation for the development of novel diagnostics
to provide early detection and moreover provide the foundation for a novel therapeutic direction for the
restoration of myocardial plasticity with HFpEF. In this project, the guiding hypothesis is that a key
molecular event in the development of HFpEF is the loss of post-transcriptional control by a specific
cassette of miRs that regulate ECM homeostasis and fibroblast activation, which results in a refractory
form of HFpEF. Integrating a standardized exercise protocol during the progression of HFpEF will
prevent this loss of miR post-transcriptional control, attenuate ECM accumulation and fibroblast
activation, and thereby prevent the development of a refractory HFpEF phenotype."

Global HIV prevention efforts have conventionally focused on supporting women and key populations through
treatment as prevention resulting in viral suppression (Undetectable = Untransmittable, U=U). This presents the
opportunity to develop interventions that support HIV prevention in heterosexual men, aged 15-49 years. Since
there are no interventions that address PrEP uptake among HIV seronegative heterosexual men, the scientific
goal of this K43 is to develop and prototype an evidence-based intervention to curb HIV acquisition in South
African men at high risk of HIV acquisition. Behavioral economics (BE) theory posits that contextual and
individual factors influence health behavior. BE will be used to understand these factors associated with pre-
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake in South African men. Candidate: I am a South African behavioral scientist
with a background in HIV research in HIV endemic communities in South Africa I am committed to improve health
seeking in this population. This K43 will support my training, mentorship, and research towards becoming an
independent investigator. Mentoring: I have assembled a multi-disciplinary team with globally recognized
expertise in their fields, committed to HIV research in South Africa. My primary mentors are Dr. Alison Buttenheim
(U.S. based, behavioral economics intervention design, evidence-based HIV care delivery, mixed methods
research), Dr. Linda-Gail Bekker (S.A.-based, clinical trials, PrEP, research in key populations). My co-
mentorship team includes: Dr. Joseph Daniels (U.S.-based, qualitative research, HIV prevention and treatment),
Dr. Andrew Medina-Marino (S.A.-based, epidemiology, men’s health, implementation science). Training: The
K43 will support mentoring and rigorous training to support me to develop expertise in 1) behavioral economics
intervention design, 2) cohort design and managing clinical trials, 3) mixed methods research design and
analysis. These aims will be supported by mentors who are global leaders in HIV prevention in limited resource
communities. Research: HIV prevalence peaks in South African males (45-49 years) later than their female (35-
39 years) counterparts and males tend to choose younger female sexual partners. Reducing HIV acquisition
among men living in LMICs is central to breaking this cycle of transmission. The specific research aims of this
award are to: 1) investigate the influence of contextual factors on PrEP uptake, 2) describe factors associated
with attrition and sustained PrEP use 3) to use BE to develop and prototype an intervention to support PrEP
uptake among men. This research is nested in the existing mobile clinic services operating in the Klipfontein
district in Cape Town, which was recently awarded a PrEP implementation grant (Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, PI Bekker) to assess community-based PrEP uptake. This study will advance NIH science on HIV
prevention in men in high HIV disease burden communities. The evidence will be used to design a BE informed
intervention for a larger clinical trial investigating the impact on reducing HIV acquisition and transmission in
men."

Loss of function progranulin (GRN) mutations, most of which cause haploinsufficiency, are a major genetic
cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with TDP-43 pathology (FTD-TDP). Progranulin-boosting therapies
are a promising treatment strategy, but the optimal progranulin-boosting strategy remains unclear. Progranulin
has pleiotropic effects and undergoes complex trafficking and processing, so the distribution of progranulin
across cell types and cellular compartments may determine the efficacy and safety of progranulin-boosting
therapies. Optimal progranulin-boosting therapies would retain progranulin’s neurotrophic and anti-
inflammatory effects, with minimal risk of adverse effects such as promotion of tumor growth. Design of such
therapies is impeded by our limited understanding of the pathogenesis of FTD due to GRN mutations (FTD-
GRN). Our prior work highlights loss of progranulin’s neurotrophic effects as an important mechanism of FTD-
GRN. Restoring neuronal progranulin corrects FTD-related social deficits in Grn+/– mice, and selective loss of
neuronal progranulin reproduces these deficits. Social deficits in Grn+/– mice are associated with loss of
dendritic arborization in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which with the mediodorsal thalamus (MDt) forms
a critical circuit for social dominance behavior. MDt-mPFC connectivity is impaired in Grn+/– mice, modeling
impaired thalamocortical connectivity in symptomatic FTD-GRN patients. Understanding the molecular
mechanism of progranulin’s neurotrophic effects may thus be crucial for design of optimal progranulin-boosting
therapies, but it is unclear if these effects are mediated by extracellular signaling or by enhancing lysosomal
activity. We therefore developed a lysosome-targeted progranulin (L-PGRN) viral vector that delivers
progranulin to lysosomes without secretion. L-PGRN reproduced several neurotrophic effects of progranulin in
cultured neurons, so we hypothesize that progranulin acts in lysosomes to maintain the structure of FTD-
related thalamocortical circuitry, and that selectively delivering progranulin to lysosomes will correct FTD-
related behavioral deficits and pathology. We will test this hypothesis in primary cortical neurons and mouse
models. In aim 1, we will determine if progranulin promotes dendritic arborization by enhancing cathepsin
activity. In aim 2, we will determine if progranulin acts in lysosomes to maintain FTD-related thalamocortical
circuitry. In aim 3, we will use a novel Grn+/–:TDP-43 transgenic mouse cross to determine if selectively
boosting lysosomal progranulin will correct FTD-related social deficits and pathology. These aims have the
potential to advance our understanding of FTD-GRN pathogenesis, and may provide insight into FTD-TDP and
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as a GRN polymorphism increases risk for FTD-TDP and AD. These studies may
also inform design of progranulin-boosting therapies by revealing lysosomes as progranulin’s key site of action.
Selectively delivering progranulin to lysosomes could effectively treat FTD with lower risk of adverse effects."

Engineered Polymer Nanoemulsions for Treatment of Wound Biofilm Infections
The goal of the proposed research to create new therapeutics targeting multidrug-resistant biofilm infections.
These infections are difficult to treat. The refractory nature of biofilm infections make them non-responsive to
standard antibiotics, a situation exacerbated by acquired antibacterial resistance.
In our research, we have integrated the nanomedicine capabilities of Rotello with wound biofilm expertise of
Patel to develop crosslinked nanoemulsions (XNEs) that use a crosslinked polymer network to stabilize
nanodroplets of essential oils. These XNEs kill biofilm-based bacteria with minimal effects on host cells and can
eradicate biofilms through incorporation of antimicrobials into the oil component of the XNE. XNEs have good
efficacy (killing ≥99% of bacteria in biofilms) using the in vivo wound biofilm model developed by Patel. Consistent
with other antimicrobial nanomaterials, however, killing is less effective in vivo than in vitro.
In our proposed research, Rotello will develop new block copolymers to generate block copolymer XNE (B-XNE)
therapeutics. The B-XNEs will then be incorporated into hydrogel wound dressings to provide controlled release
of B-XNEs to treat wound infections. B-XNEs and B-XNEs in wound dressings will be tested in vitro and in vivo
using realistic and challenging wound biofilm models.
Aim 1: Rotello will synthesize block copolymers and use these to parametrically vary size and charge of B-XNEs.
These B-XNEs will then be used to carry antibiotics, providing synergistic activity with essential oils. B-XNEs will
be screened for activity using luminescent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilms, and
then tested against other bacterial species by Rotello and Patel. Co-culture models employing mammalian cells
will be used to downselect agents that maximize antibacterial activity and minimize mammalian cell toxicity.
Aim 2: Rotello will incorporate B-XNEs into hydrogels to provide antimicrobial wound dressings. B-XNEs and
hydrogels will be co-engineered to provide controlled release of B-XNEs. These B-XNE will be screened using
luminescent MRSA to identify promising B-XNE-hydrogel combinations, and further tested as in Aim 1 by Rotello
and Patel.
Aim 3: Rotello and Patel will use murine wound biofilm models to test B-XNEs and B-XNE wound dressings.
These studies will combine parametric pilot experiments using luminescent MRSA by Rotello with full pre-clinical
evaluation by Patel with MRSA and Acinetobacter baumannii wound biofilms. Efficacy in these models will be
quantified by decreased bacterial counts, enhanced wound healing, and diminished purulence as outcomes."

 the mortality and morbidity of cancer.
 2. Design and administer all phases (i.e., pilot/Phase I, II and III) of cancer clinical trials that
 prospectively evaluate clinical, biological, patient-reported and economic endpoints.
 3. Conduct clinical cancer research in a diverse team setting to expedite and accelerate the
 translation of basic and observational research into patient-oriented clinical trials.
 4. Consider how diversity should be included and emphasized in clinical study design, recruitment,
 conduct and analysis with a goal of reducing health disparities and increasing generalizability.
 5. Obtain peer reviewed funding to support careers as independent clinician scientists."

Bone disorders such as osteomyelitis that result from bacterial infection are associated
with severe inflammation and progressive bone loss. Staphylococcus aureus is the most
common causative agent of osteomyelitis and the incidence and severity of
staphylococcal osteomyelitis appears to be increasing despite improvements in
prophylaxis and diagnosis. Dysregulation of osteoclast formation and activity results in
bone destruction and/or abnormal bone remodeling at sites of infection, and osteoblasts
play an essential role in the regulation of these bone-resorbing cells. In addition,
bacterially infected osteoblasts and osteoclasts are capable of producing an array of
immune mediators that could promote the recruitment and activation of inflammatory
leukocytes in bone tissue. The neuropeptide substance P (SP) is increasingly
recognized to exacerbate inflammation in a range of tissues including the gut, skin, and
central nervous system. Given the extensive innervation of bone tissue with SP-
containing nerve fibers, the functional expression of the specific receptor for SP (NK-1R)
by bone cells, and previous evidence that this neuropeptide can modulate bone cell
responses, we suggest that SP/NK-1R interactions exacerbate inflammation in
osteomyelitis. In this application, we propose a comprehensive preclinical evaluation of
the ability of this neuropeptide to augment inflammation in isolated murine and human
resident bone cells and an established in vivo animal model of staphylococcal
osteomyelitis. This work builds upon our prior work and will test the hypothesis that
inhibition of SP/NK-1R interactions attenuates the immune and osteolytic responses of
resident bone cells to bacteria. Furthermore, these studies represent an essential step
in evaluating the therapeutic potential of repurposing clinically approved NK-1R
antagonists as an adjunctive therapy to limit staphylococcal osteomyelitis-associated
inflammatory bone loss and/or abnormal bone remodeling, and may point to neurogenic
input as a therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory bone disorders in general."
10872184,"PROJECT SUMMARY
High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies.
Most patients initially respond to chemotherapy after surgery, yet ~80% will recur with disease that becomes
resistant to treatment. Immune therapies have shown great promise, but with limited efficacy in HGSOC. The
HGSOC tumor microenvironment (TME) is highly immuno-suppressive and this is hypothesized to promote
tumor immune evasion. We have developed two new implantable syngeneic mouse ovarian tumor models that
will allow for the molecular analysis of tumor- and host-specific signals driving immune evasion. By selecting
for aggressive growth in mice, we have extensively characterized KMF cells (gains in genes for KRas, Myc,
and FAK) that exhibit many phenotypic similarities to HGSOC; intrinsic chemo-resistance and potent immune
suppression. We will focus on FAK (focal adhesion kinase), a tyrosine kinase canonically supporting cell
motility signaling. FAK is the fifth highest amplified gene in HGSOC and greater than 65% of patients exhibit
elevated FAK mRNA with poor prognostic significance. Using pharmacological FAK inhibitors, FAK knockout,
FAK re-expression, complementation, and bioinformatic analyses of KMF cells in tumor-bearing mice, we find
that FAK drives the expression of a select group of cytokines and tumor-associated surface proteins involved
in regulating tumor growth and immune evasion. Inhibiting FAK results in decreased myeloid-derived
suppressor cell (MDSC) recruitment, increased CD4 and CD8 T cell tumor infiltration, and decreased
expression of PD-L1, CD112, and CD155 checkpoint regulatory proteins on KMF cells in vivo. These changes
are consistent with a normalization or reprogramming of the ovarian TME by FAK inhibition in a tumor-intrinsic
manner. FAK inhibition also prevents bloody ascites formation in the KMF model. A second newly-developed T
antigen-driven FAK floxed mouse ovarian carcinoma model (MOVCAR) revealed that FAK loss prevents tumor
growth in syngeneic low-T mice. FAK-null MOVCAR tumors were infiltrated by CD45+ leukocytes, and when
evaluated in immune-deficient mice, orthotopic FAK-null MOVCAR tumor growth was enhanced. This proposal
will test the hypothesis that tumor-intrinsic FAK activation facilitates immune-suppressive related changes to
the TME. Aim-1 will use a new inducible FAK expression system to evaluate FAK nuclear localization- and
kinase-dependent signals driving malignancy, chemokine expression, and MDSC recruitment. Aim-2 will test
the role CD112/CD155 immune checkpoint protein expression and whether FAK inhibition may combine with
antibodies to TIGIT (T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains) to limit tumor growth via effects on T
cells. Aim-3 will use an inducible knockout of FAK, of the related Pyk2 kinase (new model), or inducible
expression of kinase-inactive FAK in mouse endothelial cells, with the KMF implantable tumor model, to test
stromal FAK and Pyk2 signaling on the TME. These mouse studies, with analyses of patient tumors, will
provide important insights on the role of FAK inhibition to enhance immunotherapy efficacy for HGSOC."

!
Over the recent years immunotherapeutic regimens have revolutionized the fate of solid malignancies and
aggressive B-cell lymphomas but T-cell lymphoma (TCL) remains the orphan child. Identification and blockade
of the CD47-SIRPa axis has created an opportunity for investigators to harness the innate immune cells.
However early results from clinical trials have revealed that disruption of this signaling pathway is insufficient to
clear tumor cells by macrophages. Thus, there is an unmet need to identify additional regulators of the
macrophage checkpoint that confer resistance to CD47-mediated anti-tumor responses. I recently defined
mechanisms by which CD47 antagonists induce anti-TCL response (Blood, 2019). However, marked
heterogeneity across TCL models with poor correlation between CD47 expression and phagocytosis have led
us to investigate molecular mechanisms that work with CD47 or independently from it in governing TCL
recognition and eradication by macrophages. By combining modern next-generation immunophenotyping and
single-cell sequencing; I will identify, mechanistically characterize, and therapeutically validate the compensatory
signaling dependencies in CD47-resistant TCL models and primary samples. This will lay the foundation for
future clinical trials of targeted immunotherapies in TCLs.
I am an adult hematologist with substantial clinical and prior research experience in TCL who is seeking K08
support for mentored research in Dr. David Weinstock’s laboratory at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) with
Dr. David Avigan, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) acting as a co-mentor. My long-term career
objective is to lead an independent research group focused on development of immunotherapy for patients with
TCLs at an academic cancer center. The K08 award will provide the protected time I need for advanced training
in CD47 biology and immunology, in particular, analysis of large-scale transcriptome and proteome datasets,
experimental therapeutics and translational research. I will devote a minimum of 80% of my time to a focused
research program on immune therapies for TCLs and will complement this with 20% of my effort dedicated to
clinical care for adults with lymphomas. Dana-Faber Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC), comprised of DFCI and
BIDMC is an internationally recognized research program with a number of expert researchers in the areas of
cancer cell biology, immunology and computational biology. I have assembled an oustanding mentoring and
advisory committee, consisting of Dr. Francis Luscinskas, Dr. Bruce Horwitz and Dr. Vassiliki Bousiottis, who will
guide my research and training experiences. The expertise of my advisory committee will be complemented by
a set of additional collaborators who are experts in their respective fields (Dr. Jim Lederer, Dr. Alex Shalek, and
Kristen Stevenson). This research proposal is part of a structured plan with scientific, technical, clinical training
and career development components with the goal of ensuring that I acquire the expertise required to become
a successful, independent investigator with a focus on immunotherapy and clinical adult hematology."
10873178,"Malaria infection in humans, caused by single-celled parasites from the genus Plasmodium, is a major global
health challenge. Despite marked progress in the last 15 years, more than 400 million deaths occur worldwide
annually, the majority being children under age 5. Recent licensure of the first ever malaria vaccine heralds a
new era in efforts to control malaria, but the relatively modest efficacy of the RTS,S vaccine means that
complementary approaches will be essential if the WHO's goal of a 90% reduction in rates by 2030 is to be
realized. Malaria parasites are motile throughout their complex human and mosquito lifecycle. They move by a
process called gliding motility, which underpins their ability to reach, cross, and enter host tissues and cells.
Gliding is powered by a parasite actomyosin motor the disruption of which kills the infectious parasite. Towards
development of the parasite actomyosin motor as a druggable target, our collaborative team has worked to
characterize the essential class XIV single-headed myosin motor PfMyoA, the core of gliding motility. We were
the first to characterize and crystallize PfMyoA, demonstrating that its function is uniquely tuned by N-terminal
heavy chain phosphorylation. We were the first to show the essential role of PfMyoA and its essential light chain
in powering red blood cell (RBC) invasion, the stage responsible for all malaria pathogenesis. We have since
used PfMyoA mutants to reveal the energetic barriers necessary for RBC invasion using live cell imaging. These
foundations expertly position our team to extend investigation of gliding motility across the malaria lifecycle and
explore additional Plasmodium myosins and their cellular roles, which are the combined aims of this competitive
renewal. We propose (Aim 1) to define the cellular roles of PfMyoB versus PfMyoA by comparing structures,
functional properties, and the role of heavy chain phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Aim 2 proposes to
determine the binding pocket, mechanism of action, and impact on the parasite of two first-in-class small
molecule inhibitors of PfMyoA ATPase activity. Aim 3 investigates two other essential Plasmodium myosins
(PfMyoF and K), which are virtually unstudied both as motors and potential future druggable targets. PfMyoF
likely plays a role as a processive transporter, while PfMyoK likely functions during sexual development, with
motor domain inserts typical of reverse-directionality in eukaryotic class VI motors. We will use an integrative
approach highlighting in vitro functional assays (motility and ensemble force assays, optical trap assays, steady-
state and transient kinetics) and structural studies (X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM) together with live cell
approaches (including super resolution imaging) and genetic investigation of motors (conditional
knockouts/substitutions) in several stages of the Plasmodium parasite lifecycle. At completion we will have
developed a previously unattainable depth of understanding into the function of the essential Plasmodium
myosins as druggable targets, revealed profound insights into the structural basis by which myosins produce
force and motion, and discovered fundamental insights into malaria parasite cell biology."
10866397,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Despite the development of anti-CD30 antibody-based therapies and use of checkpoint inhibitors, CD30+
malignancies remain difficult to eradicate, with relapses occurring in a significant proportion of patients. The
engineering of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) in T cells has propelled the rapid generation of tumor specific
cells, increasing the clinical applicability of adoptively-transferred-cell therapies. We have developed immune
based therapies based on T cells redirected with a CAR to target the CD30 antigen, and shown in a phase I/II
trial that their adoptive transfer in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL) is safe and
produces antitumor activity, including complete responses.
We now propose to further increase the response rate and long-term durability of complete responses in patients
with CD30+ malignancies by overcoming a major barrier of CD30.CAR T cell based approaches.
We will conduct a phase I clinical trial in patients with r/r CD30+ malignancies including HL and cutaneous T cells
lymphomas (CTCL), with T cells engineered to coexpress the CD30.CAR and the specific chemokine receptor
CCR4, to demonstrate that enhanced migration and trafficking to the tumor further improves antitumor activity.
We will then monitor (both systemically and locally, in the tumor microenvironment) immune functions and
repertoire in patients with CD30+ malignancies receiving CAR T cells, to identify strengths and limits of our
approach for proposing rationale combination therapies.
Finally, we plan to study the myeloid cells signatures in these patients and how it contributes in shaping the pro-
tumorigenic landscape in the context of CAR-T cell therapies.
On completion of our study we will know the clinical impact of directed homing of CAR-Ts on in vivo functionality,
the effects and contribution on immune functions and on the pro-tumorigenic landscape associated with these
therapies. All components to execute the study are in place and we have sufficient individual and institutional
experience to ensure the study will be completed and analyzed as planned"
10866539,"This application outlines a proposal to advance the research career of a promising young
investigator within a mentored setting. Successful completion will enable the candidate to establish a career
as an independent NIH-funded surgeon-scientist, conducting translational research focused on identifying the
processes required to generate functional tissue-engineered intestine as a cure for pediatric intestinal failure.
Background: Intestinal failure is a survivable but morbid syndrome that afflicts tens of thousands of
children. Contemporary management is inadequate and costly. Tissue-engineered intestine is a potential
solution; however, complex intestinal functions have yet to be confirmed in existing models. Thus,
understanding the processes required to generate a functional intestine are a critical unmet need and a high
priority for the NIH. The enteric nervous system (ENS) is crucial for intestinal functions including barrier
maintenance and peristalsis. Serotonin receptors (e.g. 5-HT4R), expressed by intestinal epithelial cells and
enteric neurons, promote neurogenesis and regulate intestinal barrier function and motility. Based on
preliminary data and published work, we hypothesize that human intestinal organoid (HIO) function depends
on the ENS, and 5-HT4R is essential for proper ENS development and function within HIOs.
Research Design and Methods: Three aims will test this hypothesis in HIOs in vitro and transplanted HIOs
(tHIOs) in vivo± ENS. We will employ gain and loss of function experiments using 5-HT4R genetic knockouts
and pharmacological 5-HT4R agonists/antagonists. Aim 1 will evaluate the role of 5-HT4R during ENS
development in HIOs utilizing 3-D immunofluorescent (IF) advanced imaging as well as RT-qPCR to locate and
quantify the ENS. Aim 2 will assess if 5-HT4R is required for barrier function in tHIOs by measuring tight
junction production and morphology with IF staining, Western Blot, Transmission Electron Microscopy, and RTqPCR
as well as determining transepithelial resistance and permeability in an Ussing Chamber ex vivo. Aim 3
will ascertain if 5-HT4R is indispensable for peristalsis in tHIOs using non-invasive, dynamic imaging in vivo
and measuring contractility ex vivo. This project is novel because no prior study has examined the role of the
ENS in barrier function in HIOs nor applied these new imaging methods. This project is novel and innovative in
proposing a mechanism by which ENS development and function in HIOs are regulated by 5-HT4R.
Career Development Plan & Goals: Over this 5 year award, the principal investigator will have 75% protected
time to expand her background in intestinal tissue-engineering to gain new skills in ENS development and
neurogastroenterology. Completion will propel the field forward and launch her independent research career.
Research Environment: The proposed research will be carried out at UTHealth within the Texas Medical
Center, the world's largest medical center which seeks to nurture cross-institutional collaboration, creativity,
and innovation. This environment has an established success of nurturing the careers of junior investigators."
10863021,"Background: Effective healthcare-associated infection (HAI) prevention requires multiple complex interventions
(e.g., hand hygiene, environmental cleaning, personal protective equipment use, and evidence-based patient
procedure protocols such as central line maintenance). The COVID-19 pandemic’s effects on healthcare (e.g.,
staffing shortages, supply chain disruptions, modified protocols to reduce exposure) also impacted HAI
prevention. Retrospective analyses have found differential impacts on HAI rates during the pandemic, with
some HAIs increasing and others decreasing. However, there has not yet been an assessment of how the
COVID-19 pandemic specifically impacted guideline-concordant HAI prevention practices.
Significance: This pilot project directly addresses HSR&D’s research priority to enhance the Quality and
Safety of Health Care by gathering critical information regarding the implementation of HAI prevention
practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Information gathered here will inform the effective implementation of
HAI prevention activities, including resuming guideline-concordant HAI prevention practices, to reduce HAIs
across VA and increase the quality and safety of the healthcare received by Veterans.
Innovation and Impact: We will conduct a work systems analysis using the Systems Engineering Initiative for
Patient Safety (SEIPS) framework, which allows for the assessment of barriers and facilitators within and
between each individual work system element (people, tools and technology, task, organization, and
environment). This granular analysis allows for identifying and addressing specific barriers to implementation,
which can be difficult to identify in complex work systems like those in HAI prevention. By addressing these
barriers, we can develop implementation strategies to support the resuming of guideline-concordant HAI
prevention practices in work systems that were or are continuing to be affected by COVID-19-related impacts.
Specific Aims: In this pilot project, we aim to:
 1. Conduct a work systems analysis of HAI prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic among acute
 inpatient care facilities in VISN12 to identify specific impacts of the pandemic on HAI prevention and
 HCW-reported needs for improved HAI prevention during the pandemic.
 2. Identify barriers and facilitators to resuming IPC best practices in the COVID endemic era.
Methodology: We will conduct semi-structured interviews with 1) 1-2 HAI prevention stakeholders and 2) up to
5 frontline nursing personnel at each of the 8 VA medical centers in VISN12. We will use interview guides
structured around the CDC’s multidrug-resistant organism prevention strategies and the SEIPS framework to
probe pandemic-related changes to HAI prevention practices as well as reasons behind these changes and
barriers to resuming practices. We will use a rapid qualitative inquiry approach to analyze interview data,
ultimately producing 1) a specific list of HAI prevention practices that were substantially modified during the
COVID-19 pandemic and require additional implementation support to resuming practices; 2) work system
element barriers and facilitators to conducting these practices during the pandemic; and 3) a logic model
guiding the development of a larger research project on priority HAI prevention practices.
Next Steps/Implementation: This pilot project will identify specific HAI prevention practices requiring additional
implementation support, leading directly to a larger research project to gather VA-wide data on the
implementation of these practices. We will also then develop and test implementation strategies to maximize
effectiveness of the practice in reducing HAIs while minimizing burden on healthcare workers. This work will
thus improve VA’s ability to respond to major disruptions to resources and processes (as COVID-19 was) while
maintaining the safety and quality of care for Veterans."
10863022,"Background: Lung cancer kills more Veterans annually than the next three cancers combined. Lung cancer
screening (LCS) with low-dose CT reduces lung cancer mortality through early detection, yet only 2.8% of
eligible Veterans have been screened. The Lung Precision Oncology Program (LPOP) was developed to
expand the availability of high quality LCS across the VA enterprise. Through our work done through a QUERI
Rapid Project Proposal and that of others, drive time distance to a VA CT scanner has been shown to be a
barrier to LCS, especially for rural Veterans. VISNs 7 and 9 will be implementing mobile LCS (mLCS) to
address this known barrier. We hypothesize that mLCS will increase LCS reach including 1) the proportion of
Veterans offered LCS by providers, 2) uptake of LCS among eligible Veterans, and 3) adherence to
recommended follow-up LCS among Veterans utilizing mLCS. Significance: This evaluation will determine the
impact of mLCS on the offering, acceptance, and adherence to LCS by eligible Veterans. Identify facilitators
and barriers to mLCS implementation and determine start up, maintenance and overall cost efficacy.
Innovation & Impact: The evaluation of implementation of mLCS in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
is innovative and will inform mLCS implementation for other VHA sites and beyond VHA. Understanding
provider and Veteran perceptions of mLCS, barriers and facilitators to implementation, estimates of Veteran
demand, and best technology practices will provide valuable information to be included in a checklist for
replication and implementation across VHA. Ultimately this will impact and ensure mortality reduction of lung
cancer through early detection. Specific Aims: 1. Pre-implementation: Understand the development of mLCS,
assess provider staff perceptions, anticipated barriers and facilitators to implementation, and engage Veterans
to optimize implementation and messaging.2. Implementation Outcomes: Conduct a mixed-methods evaluation
of the reach (offering, uptake, and adherence) and acceptability of mLCS implementation. 3. Clinical/Health
Outcomes: Evaluate the clinical impact of and satisfaction with mLCS on the offering of, acceptance by, and
adherence to LCS by eligible Veterans. 4. Economic impacts: Assess start-up and continuing costs of mLCS
programs including implementation support costs and compare cost of mLCS compared to traditional care and
community care. Methodology: A mixed methods approach to the planning, delivery and evaluation (formative
and summative) of mLCS implementation is proposed. The Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation,
Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework will be used for planning and summative evaluation. In addition, the
Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) will be utilized for formative evaluation at
each Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) location utilizing mLCS. Data will be collected through
quantitative and qualitative assessments including surveys and interviews of providers/staff and the corporate
data warehouse. Change in proportion of eligible Veterans offered, accepting, and adherent to LCS prior to
and after implementation of mLCS. Results will be characterized for the overall cohort of Veterans pursuing
mLCS and stratified by distance traveled for screening. Next Steps/Implementation: Our research team will
partner with key stakeholders to create a checklist of resources needed and steps to take to gain support, fund,
and implement mLCS that will serve to assist other VA VISNs and facilities considering mLCS. We will partner
with Veteran stakeholders to identify the best way to message mLCS to optimize implementation."
10863111,"HEALTH OF AGING MEXICANS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER.
PROJECT SUMMARY.
Aging in the United States is increasingly contingent on the health of adults from historically-disadvantaged
groups. The Mexican-origin population is one of the fastest growing segments of US elderly and one facing
many disadvantages, both from experiences prior to immigration and by hardship experienced since
immigration. The accumulation of decades of poor working and living conditions and poor access to health
care have likely led to the particularly problematic physical and mental health problems observed in this
population in old age, despite exhibiting “paradoxically” low cardiovascular mortality risks. These problems may
have deteriorated further due to contemporary declines in the conditions that facilitate the social inclusion of
immigrants and their descendants. The impact of these changes on older Latinos and their support networks is
essentially unknown.
The health impacts of changes in immigration-related climate, policies, and practices also likely affects aging
populations in Mexico. One in five older adults in Mexico have previous migration experience in the U.S. Many
older Mexican adults depend on economic, social, and emotional support from relatives living in the U.S.,
particularly their adult children. These family support networks have been disrupted by e.g., the deportation
and unplanned return of circa 2 million Mexican immigrants from the United States over the last 15 years.
This project examines how changes to migration patterns and policies shape aging in the Mexican-origin
population on both the U.S. and Mexico. Using a novel, binational approach that jointly considers different
forms of migration-related selection, mortality and proxy selection, and several kinds of unobserved
heterogeneity, we examine how the physical, cognitive, and mental health of older adults has changed over
time as a function of their migration experiences. We analyze rich longitudinal data from the 2006-2018 Health
and Retirement Study (HRS) in the United States and the 2001-2018 Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS)
in Mexico using several ancillary datasets to enhance the measurement of different dimensions of immigrant
social inclusion (ISI). We have three aims. First, we estimate the association between cumulative
disadvantage and chronic mental, physical, and cognitive health and mortality. Second, we examine the
contribution of spatiotemporal variation in attitudes, policies, and practices influencing ISI to changes in mental
and physical health among older adults in the US. Third, we assess how changes in the location and support
younger adult children provide to elderly parents living in the United States and Mexico affect parental mental
and physical health."
10867422,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Maintaining mobility is fundamental to extending our healthspan. Reduced mobility may be driven by
fatigability, a new metric that quantifies deterioration in performance and the accompanying increase in
perceived effort. Muscle fatigue (decrease in maximal power with activity) in older adults, and to a greater
degree in those with mobility impairments, could contribute to greater fatigability in aging through changes in
muscle coordination, leading to altered gait mechanics and a higher metabolic cost of walking. Ourscientific
premise for the proposed role of muscle fatigue is built on robust evidence that older adults have greater
muscle fatigue in major locomotor muscles during low-load, high-velocity maximal concentric contractions;
and greater knee extensor muscle fatigue in response to a treadmill walk than younger adults. However,
evidence is lacking for how muscle fatigue compounds age- or impairment-related muscle weakness to alter
gait neuromechanics, and the connections to cost of walking and fatigability. Our overall goal is to generate a
new framework for understanding fatigability by quantifying the neuromechanical effects and energetic
consequences of muscle fatigue on gait, so that efficacious interventions to prevent or reverse fatigability can be
pursued. Our central hypothesis is that muscle fatigue contributes to fatigability by exacerbating age-related
changes in gait mechanics and variability (Aim 1) through changes in the control and coordination of gait (Aim
2), such that with muscle fatigue greater energy is required for walking in older adults (Aim 3). To test this
hypothesis, data will be gathered for 4 groups of 15 men and 15 women each: sedentary young (30-40 yr) and
older (70-80) healthy adults, mobility-impaired older adults (70-80), and active older adults (70-80 yr). This
combination of groups will allow us to evaluate the independent effects of age, physical activity and mobility
impairment, and test for sex effects. All groups, except the active older, will be relatively sedentary, similar to
the general US population. We will use our new, physiologically- and clinically-relevant 30 minute treadmill
walk to cause lower-extremity muscle fatigue and quantify the response with measures of gait mechanics and
variability, electromyography, and energy cost of walking. Computer simulations of walking based on models
representing the 4 groups will help provide a mechanistic understanding of the muscular basis for the gait
adaptations and consequences for whole body energetics. The modeling and experimental approaches are
tightly integrated to identify how individual muscles contribute to fatigue-induced altered gait mechanics and
increased energy cost of walking with age and impairment (Aim 2 & 3). The problem to be addressed-
fatigability and its impact on mobility in aging- tackles stated goals of the NIH and NIA. Project success will
have a significant impact by bridging an existing knowledge gap from muscle weakness and fatigue to the
fatigability that currently prevents many older adults from achieving an optimal healthspan."
10867511,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), particularly e-cigarettes, are increasingly prevalent, with
their use matching or surpassing conventional cigarettes in certain age groups. Unlike combustible
cigarettes, ENDS allow on-demand access to single puffs. Despite the central importance of accurate
characterization of ENDS puff behavior in the natural environment, current assessment approaches are
quite limited. To overcome critical barriers to progress in the field, we propose to evaluate and deploy an
inexpensive instrument that can accurately, objectively, and non-obtrusively track real-time puff behavior
across a wide variety of ENDS products without interrupting the natural behavior of the user. The Flexible
Robust Instrumentation of ENDS (FRIENDS) monitor employs a miniature non-contact electromagnetic
sensor that detects the current flow from the battery through the heater coil, allowing detection of puffs
and puff duration regardless of ENDS generation and/or physical form (e.g., cig-alikes, pens, tanks, and
pods systems). We propose recruiting 240 daily ENDS users, sampled for variety of ENDS devices and
user characteristics. As new ENDS devices are encountered, they will be bench-tested to determine the
best location for FRIENDS attachment, and we will measure the relationship between puff duration and
volume. These results will be added to an open-source FRIENDS library. Each participant will vape ad lib
with their FRIENDS-enabled ENDS during a video-taped lab visit and for 7 days in their natural
environment. Biochemical measures of exposure and a range of self-report data will also be collected. The
study will address several critical questions, including: To what extent does self-report reflect accurately
capture variability (across people and days) in objective real-world vaping frequency, and how much does
objective data from the lab visit improve prediction? To what extent do objective puff measures from
FRIENDS outperform self-report measures in predicting nicotine exposure? Finally, what are the
objective classes of ENDS use behavior (e.g., predominantly “bingers” [the focus of standard self-report]
vs. predominantly “grazers” [a pattern missing from self-report but evident preliminary objective
monitoring studies])? How common is each class? Is the ability of self-report to predict real-world vaping
frequency and nicotine exposure particularly poor for grazers compared to bingers? The proposed study
will provide novel and much-needed information about the nature of ENDS use behavior and has the
potential to markedly influence future work. Moreover, the project will curate an extensive, open-source
FRIENDS library, providing everything needed to produce and use the FRIENDS monitor with 125+
ENDS. Thus, we will make available to the field an inexpensive and accurate method for assessing puff
quantity, duration, and patterning in a wide range of ENDS studies."

The overarching goal of this study is to identify effective metabolic based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies
to improve the overall survival of patients with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We propose to investigate
the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, 18F-BnTP as a novel metabolic diagnostic and to develop
metabolic based therapeutic strategies targeting oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in therapy resistant
KRAS/LKB1 and EGFR mutant lung tumors. NSCLC will claim the lives of ~130,000 in the US in 2021. Lung
tumors frequently possess a high mutational burden, often rendering single agent therapies targeting oncogenic
driver mutations unsuccessful. Furthermore, metabolically active subsets of lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs)
bearing mutations in KRAS and LKB1 or EGFR are frequently resistant to immunotherapy approaches. However,
regardless of the initials benefits from checkpoint inhibitors or targeted therapies, the majority of patients will
eventually develop resistance to therapy. We rationalize a different approach to overcoming therapy resistance
in NSCLC – namely the classification of tumors by their metabolic signature. Here, tumors are grouped and
targeted by their metabolic dependencies rather than solely by their genetic alterations. NSCLC is a metabolically
heterogeneous disease and tumors utilize both glycolytic and oxidative mitochondrial metabolism to grow. The
mitochondria are the site of cellular bioenergetics and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and are essential
for lung tumor initiation and maintenance. Due to a lack of in vivo imaging probes there is a gap in our knowledge
at a physiological and mechanistic level of how mitochondrial bioenergetics are regulated in NSCLC. To address
this gap, we functionally imaged mitochondrial activity in lung tumors utilizing the PET imaging tracer 18F-BnTP
and demonstrate that it functions an in vivo biomarker of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) and oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in lung tumors3. Importantly, by using 18F-BnTP PET imaging we are able to
distinguish between OXPHOS dependent and independent lung tumors. Therapeutically, we have demonstrated
that 18F-BnTP positive, OXPHOS-dependent LUADs are sensitive to mitochondrial complex I inhibitors. We
hypothesize that 18F-BnTP PET imaging can be utilized to functionally profile mitochondrial bioenergetics and
adaptive oxidative metabolism in therapy-resistant lung tumors to guide treatment with OXPHOS inhibitors. In
aim 1 we will perform an in vivo dissection of mitochondrial bioenergetics in therapy-resistant LUADs. In aim 2
we will perform a structural and functional in vivo analysis of adaptive oxidative metabolism in therapy-resistant
KRAS/LKB1 and EGFR mutant LUADs. In Aim 3 we will longitudinally profile oxidative metabolism in LUAD
patients with advanced disease. The proposed work has relevance to human health in which we propose that
18F-BnTP PET imaging guided targeting and oxidative metabolism represents a new therapeutic strategy to
overcome therapy resistance in patients with KRAS/LKB1 and EGFR mutant tumors."

11059726,"Abstract (30 line):
The overarching goal of this study is to identify effective metabolic based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies
to improve the overall survival of patients with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We propose to investigate
the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, 18F-BnTP as a novel metabolic diagnostic and to develop
metabolic based therapeutic strategies targeting oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in therapy resistant
KRAS/LKB1 and EGFR mutant lung tumors. NSCLC will claim the lives of ~130,000 in the US in 2021. Lung
tumors frequently possess a high mutational burden, often rendering single agent therapies targeting oncogenic
driver mutations unsuccessful. Furthermore, metabolically active subsets of lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs)
bearing mutations in KRAS and LKB1 or EGFR are frequently resistant to immunotherapy approaches. However,
regardless of the initials benefits from checkpoint inhibitors or targeted therapies, the majority of patients will
eventually develop resistance to therapy. We rationalize a different approach to overcoming therapy resistance
in NSCLC – namely the classification of tumors by their metabolic signature. Here, tumors are grouped and
targeted by their metabolic dependencies rather than solely by their genetic alterations. NSCLC is a metabolically
heterogeneous disease and tumors utilize both glycolytic and oxidative mitochondrial metabolism to grow. The
mitochondria are the site of cellular bioenergetics and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and are essential
for lung tumor initiation and maintenance. Due to a lack of in vivo imaging probes there is a gap in our knowledge
at a physiological and mechanistic level of how mitochondrial bioenergetics are regulated in NSCLC. To address
this gap, we functionally imaged mitochondrial activity in lung tumors utilizing the PET imaging tracer 18F-BnTP
and demonstrate that it functions an in vivo biomarker of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) and oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in lung tumors3. Importantly, by using 18F-BnTP PET imaging we are able to
distinguish between OXPHOS dependent and independent lung tumors. Therapeutically, we have demonstrated
that 18F-BnTP positive, OXPHOS-dependent LUADs are sensitive to mitochondrial complex I inhibitors. We
hypothesize that 18F-BnTP PET imaging can be utilized to functionally profile mitochondrial bioenergetics and
adaptive oxidative metabolism in therapy-resistant lung tumors to guide treatment with OXPHOS inhibitors. In

Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is one of the most common forms of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and is often
progressive leading to loss of lung function and death. Given that anti-fibrotic therapy can reduce progression,
even in patients with less severe disease, there is more urgency to detect early stages of PF. Dr. Rose’s research
group has helped to define imaging patterns, called interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA), that can help to predict
early stages of PF. The fact that ILA is so much more prevalent than IPF, however, compels us to identify the
subsets of ILA most likely to experience adverse outcomes. Dr. Rose’s initial work in the COPDGene cohort
demonstrated that a combination of advanced imaging findings and pulmonary function identifies a high-risk
group of ILA. The optimal method for predicting adverse outcomes, however, remains unclear and replication in
other populations is warranted. Furthermore, novel biomarkers are needed, and the mechanisms of severity in
this disease need to be better understood. The overall goal of this project is to identify the best method for the
risk-stratification of ILA in order to identify a subset that may benefit from early intervention.
In the first aim, Dr. Rose will assess the ability of clinical variables to predict a range of longitudinal outcomes
and identify the optimal set of clinical criteria that helps to classify high-risk ILA. In the second aim, he will utilize
proteomic measures to evaluate plasma proteins and multi-protein models that help to risk-stratify ILA. Finally in
the third aim, he will explore genetic predictors of the proteins most significantly associated with high-risk ILA.
This work will be performed in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, at Brigham and Women’s
Hospital (BWH), a core teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School. Dr. Rose will perform this work under the
mentorship of Dr. Hunninghake, an expert in the field of early IPF characterization and Dr. Raby, an expert in
genetic epidemiology. With the guidance of his mentors and scientific advisory committee, Dr. Rose has
developed a comprehensive five-year training program to develop the skills needed to complete the project and
become an independent investigator with expertise in imaging characterization, machine-learning techniques,
complex multi-omic analyses, and their integration.
Dr. Rose is dedicated to a career in academic medicine. His goal is to become a physician-investigator using
the knowledge and skills gained during this project to better our understanding of adverse outcomes in pulmonary
fibrosis and the biologic processes that lead to progressive disease, in a way that will ultimately benefit the
patients suffering from this disease."
10864183,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is characterized by functional impairment, is highly
prevalent in older persons, causes substantial morbidity, and has limited treatment options. An emerging view
of HFpEF is that it represents a systemic geriatric condition resulting from accelerated biological aging of multiple
organ systems, underscoring the clinical and pathobiological overlap of HFpEF and frailty. The Rehabilitation
Therapy in Older Acute Heart Failure Patients trial (REHAB-HF) randomized 349 hospitalized HF patients to
usual care versus a dedicated physical rehabilitation intervention. At 3 months, the intervention was associated
with meaningful improvements in functional status, 6-minute walk distance, and quality of life and the effects
were more pronounced in individuals with poorer baseline frailty. While these findings highlight the importance
of addressing frailty in HF, current methods to assess frailty in individuals with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are
limited by lack of uniformity, overlap of frailty measures with CVD-related deficits, and lack of precision in
assigning of frailty phenotypes to underlying biological pathways and mechanisms of frailty. In preliminary
studies, we quantified >1000 circulating proteins in ≈800 older adults with aortic stenosis and developed
proteomic signatures of frailty phenotypes observing that: (1) age accounts for limited variance in frailty-
associated proteins; (2) proteomic signatures of frailty are related to non-CVD mortality; and (3) proteins
associated with frailty are involved in classic and novel pathways of metabolism, muscle physiology, fibrosis,
and cachexia. In this R21, we will evaluate how proteomic signatures of frailty respond to an effective intervention
by measuring >700 circulating cardiometabolic/inflammatory proteins in REHAB-HF trial participants with
HFpEF. We hypothesize that alterations in the circulating proteome during a randomized frailty-targeted
intervention will relate to changes in physical function and prioritize biomarkers of aging and frailty. We will test
this hypothesis using 2 integrative Specific Aims (SAs). In SA1, we identify how the circulating proteome changes
with physical rehabilitation in REHAB-HF and how these changes relate to improvements in frailty measures. In
SA2, we evaluate how proteins prioritized in our preliminary data and SA1 relate to multi-organ phenotypes of
healthy aging and physical function in mostly middle-aged participants from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS)
and Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDA) Study with overlapping proteomic coverage.
Cohorts are diverse by race (CARDIA) and sex and capture a broad age range (FHS) and longitudinal follow-up
in middle adulthood (with serial proteomics; CARDIA). Successful completion of this project will characterize the
modifiability of proteomic signatures of frailty in response to a physical rehabilitation intervention in frail older
persons with a crucial age-related comorbidity (HFpEF) and pave the way to larger studies to define biomarkers
of frailty that may be used for screening and predicting the clinical response to physical rehabilitation. Samples
are immediately available for assay, and data will be made available per NIH Data Sharing Policies."
10868436,"The overarching mission of my research program is to elucidate how the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus and
ribosome biogenesis connect to cellular processes to coordinate complex growth modes during organismal
development. The overall objectives of the current proposal are: (1) identification of cell non-autonomous factors
that provide a ribosome synthesis checkpoint to control organism-wide growth and (2) investigation of the
epigenetic function of nucleolus during organism development. First, we will identify regulators of cell non-
autonomous growth arrest in C. elegans by intensive forward genetic screens in strains that produce both wild-
type and homozygous ribosomal protein & rDNA null cells in precise lineages. To understand tissue specific
contributions to organism-wide growth, we will optimize a system that will reversibly block new ribosome
synthesis in a tissue and stage-specific way. Second, we will take advantage of viable C. elegans embryos that
lack multi-copy rDNA locus (hence the nucleolus structure) to investigate the fundamental roles of nucleolus in
genome organization and gene expression. We will identify and validate nucleolus associated domains. We will
then identify the global impact of nucleolus on chromosome architecture, genome organization and gene
expression. This study will (1) shed light onto the cell non-autonomous pathways that regulate organism-wide
growth coordination and (2) will identify the epigenetic roles of the nucleolus that are distinct from its essential
ribosome biogenesis function."

 Advances in molecular neuroscience, genetics, and basic behavioral science have vastly expanded our
knowledge and understanding on the etiology and pathophysiology of mental illness, and identified new
molecular targets for therapeutic development. PET imaging has similarly expanded dramatically and now
provides critical translational tools for molecular imaging and therapeutic development in mental disorders. PET
imaging with target-specific radioligands has played a critical role in the elucidation of molecular targets, such
as receptors and transporters for the dopamine, serotonin, opioid, GABA, glutamate, endocannabinoid, and
acetylcholine systems, in the pathophysiology of depression, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. The
availability of suitable radioligands is key to exploring the full potential of PET imaging in mental health research.
 The goal of this renewal application is to advance an innovative program in the development, validation, and
application of novel PET radioligands to probe high priority molecular targets implicated in mental health
disorders. This program builds on the Yale PET Center's outstanding capability in radioligand development and
clinical evaluation. We use a tiered development strategy: Tier 1 - Chemistry development and in vitro testing;
Tier 2 - In vivo assessment in non-human primates; Tier 3 – First-in-human proof of concept/validation studies;
and Tier 4 - Application to investigate mechanisms of mental illnesses. Radioligands enter the development
scheme at any tier when there is sufficient rationale that advancing the radioligand can inform disease
mechanisms of relevant mental disorders. The program's External Scientific Panel and Steering Committee
(NIMH program leaders, industry and academic subject-matter experts, and Yale scientists) hold annual
meetings to nominate new targets and review ongoing data to optimize the radioligand pipeline. Radioligands
developed and data generated under the program are disseminated via a dedicated website, conference
presentations and publications, and shared with the PET imaging and mental health research community.
 This program aligns tightly with NIMH priorities by involvement of NIMH program officers in the decision-
making process, and engages the entire PET tracer development and imaging community in the common
endeavor to validate novel radioligands for molecular targets important in mental health research. The initial
funding cycle resulted in the validation of a novel agonist tracer for the dopamine D1 receptor, the first-in-human
testing of radiotracers for histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), and most
significantly, the development of first-in-class radiotracers for the GABA transporter-1 (GAT-1), and best-in-class
radiotracer for the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor complex, which we propose to translate to first-in-
human evaluation in this renewal application. Success in the next cycle will see validation of first-in-class and
best-in-class radiotracers for imaging and quantification of GAT-1, GluN2B, and AMPA receptors in humans,
and development of novel radiotracers for new targets to advance mental health research through PET imaging."
10866050,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of global mortality. Treatment is efficacious and low cost for most
people, but clinic-based (“passive”) case detection leaves millions of people with TB undiagnosed every year.
To accelerate progress against TB, we must bring detection and prevention to communities – but community-
based interventions, such as systematic screening and TB preventive treatment (TPT), are resource intensive
at scale. Evidence on how to target community-based TB interventions for greatest impact and efficiency is
therefore urgently needed. Novel data sources – including aggregated cell phone records, genomic
sequencing, and empiric estimates of cost – are emerging as critical tools for understanding and fighting TB in
high-burden settings. Scientists who can analyze these data using rigorous and reproducible techniques while
applying a health policy lens will be essential to our future success against the world’s leading infectious killer.
The goal of this project is to identify ways to make community-level TB screening and prevention more
impactful and cost-effective by better characterizing the spatial dynamics of TB and Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) transmission. My training aims include: (1) develop expertise in spatial epidemiology and the
analysis of mobility data; (2) obtain training in molecular epidemiology; and (3) gain skills to link these data
sources to mathematical models. These aims link to three research aims: (1) refine estimates of subnational
TB prevalence by synthesizing emerging sources of data; (2) use genomic data to identify key populations
among whom Mtb transmission is concentrated; and (3) project the impact and cost-effectiveness of targeted
TB screening and prevention approaches. This research will leverage both aggregated cell phone mobility data
and genomic, spatial, mobility, and epidemiologic data from three studies in Uganda and South Africa with
unique designs that lend themselves well toward describing the spatial scale of Mtb transmission. To achieve
success as an independent investigator, I also plan to obtain experience with field-based epidemiological
studies and gain familiarity with the clinical management of TB in high-burden settings.
I am a junior faculty member in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine
with a quantitative background in infectious disease modeling and health policy. My long-term career goal is to
become an independent researcher who informs more evidence-based TB policymaking by integrating diverse
sources of data into mathematical models. During this award period, I will be mentored by a team whose
expertise spans TB epidemiology and clinical care, molecular epidemiology, infectious disease dynamics,
human mobility, and mechanistic and statistical disease modeling.
Collectively, this research and career development plan will provide a pathway to a career as an independent
investigator situated at the intersection of “big data”, disease modeling, and policy analysis who generates
evidence that can help reduce the immense and persistent global burden of TB."
10866051,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) affect 15% of older US adults, with greater burden
among those who are racially minoritized. Experiences in early life (e.g., differential exposure to childhood
adversity) contribute to racial inequity in AD/ADRD risk. Population distributions of these early life experiences,
however, are themselves shaped by upstream factors that remain underexplored in the AD/ADRD literature.
National, state, and local governmental investments in public goods, and which goods are prioritized, are one
such set of intervenable upstream factors conditioning early life across place and time. For example, in 1965
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act facilitated intergovernmental grants (from federal to local
governments via states) to enhance educational programing. By the 1980s, however, educational investments
were outpaced by prison/jail expenditures, with racially minoritized communities disproportionately targeted.
While upstream factors like governmental investments in early life could be linked to AD/ADRD inequity, and
therefore serve as a structural lever for primary prevention, this has yet to be empirically tested.
This K99/R00 leverages a novel longitudinal governmental spending database and two large, nationally
representative, prospective datasets (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979; US Health and Retirement
Study) to estimate effects of federal, state, and local governmental investments in early life on midlife cognition
and later life AD/ADRD risk. Triangulating across the strengths of confounder-control and quasi-experimental
methods, this K99/R00 advances a nascent evidence base by (1) examining if county legal system or K-12
education investments in early life are independently associated with overall risk for or inequity in midlife
cognition and later life AD/ADRD; (2) characterizing how county legal system and K-12 education investments
jointly co-vary over early life and evaluating if investment co-occurrence is associated with overall risk for or
inequity in midlife cognition and later life AD/ADRD; and (3) examining if early life exposure to federal policies
monetarily investing in K-12 education affects midlife cognition, later life AD/ADRD, and inequity.
Under the guidance of an expert, multidisciplinary mentorship team, the accompanying training plan builds on
the candidate’s subject matter and methodological background with additional skill building in the clinical/
epidemiologic dimensions of AD/ADRD and its racialized and gendered lifecourse determinants; database
development; methods for characterizing longitudinal exposures; and quasi-experimental analysis methods.
The proposed research aligns with several NIA strategic goals on identifying environmental and social factors
in early life that create and sustain disparities among older adults. Further, it initiates evaluation of early life
governmental spending as a potential structural determinant of cognitive aging, develops a novel dataset –
linkable to any individual outcome data – for future work, and is designed to directly inform prevention efforts."

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for more than 430,000 cases of cancer worldwide and about 180,000
cancer-related deaths each year. Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) is the most frequent (75%–80%) subtype of RCC.
Traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy are largely ineffective in the treatment of all RCC subtypes. The
development of multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immunotherapeutic agents notably changed
the treatment paradigm of advanced kidney cancer. However, despite the therapeutic progress, complete and
durable responses have been noted in only a few cases. Furthermore, responses to the available therapeutic
agents remain unpredictable in individual ccRCC patients. We have shown previously that LDL cholesterol
compromises the antitumor efficacy of clinically relevant TKIs. Our recent findings show that major lipoproteins
(i.e. LDL, HDL, and VLDL) are equally effective in supporting growth of ccRCC cells and counteracting the
antitumor activity of TKIs. In contrast to normal cells, ccRCC cells largely depend on exogenous cholesterol
supply. The intracellular trafficking of exogenous lipoprotein-derived cholesterol appears to be distinct from
movement of endogenously synthesized cholesterol. De novo synthetized cholesterol is transported from the
endoplasmic reticulum directly to the plasma membrane and to the acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase
whereas lipoprotein-derived cholesterol is distributed through the NPC1-dependent endosomal trafficking
system. NPC1 plays a critical role in maintaining adequate cholesterol supply in cells that cannot produce
endogenous cholesterol. Expression of NPC1 is increased in ccRCC at mRNA and protein levels, and high
expression of NPC1 is associated with poor prognosis based on TCGA data analysis. Importantly, trafficking of
de novo synthetized cholesterol in normal cells is not affected by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of NPC1,
in contrast to trafficking of exogenously-derived cholesterol. Our recent findings support this observation showing
that ccRCC cells are particularly sensitive to NPC1 inhibition. Given that ccRCC cells have redundant
mechanisms of cholesterol acquisition, we hypothesize that only concomitant targeting of all sources of
cholesterol acquisition or common routes of intracellular cholesterol trafficking would deprive tumor cells of
cholesterol supply. To test our hypothesis and to elucidate the role of NPC1 as a novel therapeutic target and a
potential prognostic biomarker in ccRCC, we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Evaluate NPC1 as a
potential therapeutic target in ccRCC; (2) Determine if expression of lipid biomarkers correlates with clinical
outcomes in ccRCC."

A comprehensive understanding of immunity necessitates a thorough exploration of the intricate interactions
between immune cells and neurotransmitters, thereby clarifying their impact on communication at the neuron-
immune synapse. The long-term goal of my research program is to develop new electrochemical and microfluidic
tools to study dynamic neuroimmune communication to understand the molecular mechanisms of
neuroinflammation. To achieve this goal, new approaches are needed which can measure immune cell
communication with higher temporal resolution. The specific objective of this proposal is to demonstrate and
determine the mechanism of subsecond dopamine signaling from CD4+ CD25+ T-cells (Tregs) and to establish
how dopamine release from senescent Tregs impacts neuronal health. Tregs are important immune cells that
function to suppress the immune system and have been implicated in several age-associated neurodegenerative
diseases. Tregs contain the machinery to synthesize and respond to dopamine; however, to date, direct real-time
measurements of dopamine release and how this subsecond signaling influences neuron-immune crosstalk has
not been possible. Current paradigms hold that immune cell secretion of neurotransmitters does not occur with
subsecond dynamics seen in neurons and is therefore dispensable in neuronal biology. The evidence supporting
this viewpoint is limited by the lack of experimental systems to measure physiological secretion of neurotransmitters
by immune cells on this timescale. Our unprecedented preliminary studies using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry
(FSCV) reveals that T cells are capable of rapid subsecond secretion of dopamine. This proposal is based on the
premise that employing traditional neuroscience methods to investigate neurochemical signaling in isolated
immune cells can yield valuable insights into the dynamic mechanisms of subsecond immune cell communication
during aging. The proposal will be completed by the following two specific aims: (1) Ascertain the mechanism of
subsecond dopamine release from Tregs and (2) Develop a neuron-Treg co-culture platform to probe the
consequence of subsecond Treg-derived dopamine signaling on neuronal health with age. We will pursue these
aims with an innovative approach combining the power of FSCV’s subsecond detection capabilities with traditional
immunology approaches in co-cultures of Tregs and cholinergic neurons. This work is significant because we will
reveal the ability of Tregs to release dopamine on a subsecond timescale and demonstrate that this rapid immune-
derived neurochemical signaling influences neuronal health for the first time. The expected outcome is a new
understanding of the dynamics of immune cell signaling and a deeper understanding of the molecular changes
which occur at the neuron-immune cell synapse as a function of age. This work will have a positive impact on how
we study immune cell signaling, and will advance current knowledge of how neurochemicals help regulate immunity
leading to advancements in targeted immunotherapies for neurodegenerative diseases."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, accounting for
approximately half to two-thirds of all cases of dementia. It is associated with cognitive impairments and an
increase in β-amyloid plaque (Aβ) deposits. Moreover, alcohol use disorder (AUD) has been associated with
neurodegeneration and cognitive impairments, but the role of alcohol dependence on AD has been somewhat
controversial. Recent evidence suggests a likely role for alcohol use as a risk factor in onset and severity of
Alzheimer's disease, however overall reports have been mixed. Given the pervasive use of alcohol, it is critical
to understand the potential impact of alcohol drinking on AD. We will examine the impact of a history of alcohol
dependence on the onset and severity of behavioral and neuropathological symptoms associated with AD. We
will further examine how alcohol dependence influences neural network function in AD. We will assess whether
or not treatment with Memantine can reverse the behavioral and neuropathological symptoms. We hypothesize
that a history of alcohol dependence will result in an earlier onset of cognitive impairment in AD mice as well as
a greater presence of Aβ deposits and that these deficits will be rescued by chronic treatment with Memantine.
We hypothesize that a history of alcohol dependence in AD mice will alter network connectivity (decrease
modularity and change hub regions) and that these effects will be alleviated by Memantine treatment. Alterations
of functional network connectivity that are caused by alcohol dependence will be assessed in a mouse model of
AD. These changes will be compared with the brain-wide spread of Aβ deposits, which will indicate the way in
which AD affects brain-wide function, potentially beyond brain areas with signs of neuropathology. Furthermore,
the role of alcohol dependence in AD (e.g., changes in network connectivity and behavioral and
neuropathological symptoms) will be examined using a relevant translational preclinical model of AUD. Cognitive
function, anxiety-like behavior, and irritability-like behavior will be assessed in AD and wildtype alcohol drinking
and alcohol naive mice. The number and location of Aβ deposits will be assessed AD mice. Differences in
network connectivity in AD and wildtype mice will be examined using hierarchical clustering and graph theory. If
alcohol dependence is found to impact the onset of neurological and behavioral symptoms of AD, then this will
be a highly significant finding that will have a broad impact on preclinical and clinical research. These potential
findings may also directly influence public guidelines for alcohol consumption, especially in those with a familial
risk for AD."
10871705,"Severe insomnia occurs during the withdrawal from chronic use of alcohol. To gain relief from
insomnia, alcoholics begin drinking again. Although the cause of the insomnia is unknown, indirect
measurements of neuronal activity (c-FOS, fMRI) suggest that during insomnia, more of the arousal-
promoting neurons are hyperactive. The status of the sleep-promoting neurons is unknown but are likely to be
less active. Our overall hypothesis is that it is the imbalance in activity between wake versus sleep-promoting
neurons that is the basis of insomnia during the withdrawal from alcohol. We will directly test this hypothesis
in a proven mouse model of chronic ethanol intoxication using newly developed neuroscience tools. Aim 1 will
use a miniscope to image Ca2+ influx (as a readout of cell activity) in specific hypothalamic wake-promoting
(orexin) or hypothalamic sleep-promoting (GABA) neurons before, during and after chronic intermittent
exposure to alcohol (CIE). We will image the neurons during waking, NREM, and REM sleep. We hypothesize
that during the CIE-period of insomnia, the orexin neurons are more active while the sleep-promoting GABA
neurons are less active. We have robust preliminary data indicating that the GABA neurons have become less
active after chronic alcohol exposure. Similarly, our preliminary data reveals that orexin neurons have become
more active. The deep-brain Ca2+ imaging method provides descriptive data. Thus Aims 2 and 3 will use
pharmacogenetics to mechanistically test the hypothesis that CIE has shifted the excitability thresholds of the
GABA and orexin neurons. In-vitro slice electrophysiology studies will confirm the hypothesis. To induce sleep
to correct the insomnia, Aim 2 will activate the GABA neurons, while Aim 3 will inhibit the orexin neurons.
Aim 4 will test the hypothesis that after CIE, because sleep has improved with our pharmacogenetic
manipulations, then the mice will show less preference for drinking alcohol. This aim goes to the core of our
hypothesis that improving sleep prevents alcohol relapse.
The overall impact of our studies is that, for the first time, hard evidence will mechanistically link insomnia
during the withdrawal from chronic ethanol intoxication to changes of activity in specific phenotypes of
hypothalamic sleep or wake-promoting neurons. Furthermore, our aims are translational and will aid in the
development of appropriate treatments for insomnia. Our aims are integrated and employ cutting-edge tools to
understand how chronic ethanol exposure disrupts sleep homeostasis. This project will be conducted jointly by
experts in the areas of sleep neurobiology and alcohol addiction."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), an emerging risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
disproportionately impacts the Mexican-origin (MO) population. This is of particular concern in the Southern
Arizona U.S.-Mexico border region as liver disease and liver cancer are among the leading causes of death for
MO adults. While disparities of NAFLD prevalence have been attributed to the interplay of genetic, behavioral,
and socioenvironmental factors, limited scientific efforts have been undertaken to characterize the underlying
mechanisms driving the well documented NAFLD disparities in MO communities. Further, despite foreign-born
MO adults increased risk of experiencing acculturative stress, chronic stress associated with the acculturation
process, it has rarely been considered in the context of NAFLD. This is a significant gap in knowledge given
acculturative stress has been linked to poor lifestyle behaviors (e.g., diet) and stress-related inflammation;
thereby driving aberrant liver pathologies and ultimately cancer carcinogenesis. In fact, it has been hypothesized
that elevated levels of pro-inflammatory markers may be the primary pathophysiological pathway linking chronic
stress and NAFLD. However, this remains to be determined. Thus, informed by the Lifespan Biopsychosocial
Model of Cumulative Vulnerability and Minority, in the proposed project we will combine complementary
quantitative and qualitative approaches in a mixed-methods project to (1) investigate the relationship between
acculturative stress and NAFLD severity among a sample of 150 MO adults with known NAFLD; (2) the
relationship between acculturative stress and pro-inflammatory markers among a sample of 150 MO adults with
known NAFLD; and (3) qualitatively asess the impact of acculturative stress on MO adults’ modifiable behaviors
that drive inflammatory response and are central to NAFLD management. The proposed project, led by an
experienced multidisciplinary team of investigators, is a critical step to develop effective stress management
strategies to reduce NAFLD and liver cancer risk among MO individuals in Southern Arizona."

 Cochlear implant (CI) users are typically able to maintain conversations in quiet environments.
However, when multiple people are talking simultaneously, such as at a large family dinner or in a restaurant,
CI users have great difficulty participating in conversations and frequently withdraw or avoid the situation.
Ideally, CI algorithms to remove background talkers (“babble”) from the signal will allow for improved
comprehension and conversational engagement. Although CIs incorporate noise reduction (NR) algorithms,
these algorithms are not effective when the background is babble. Separating babble from a foreground talker
poses two significant challenges. First, the spectral properties of the signal and noise are extremely similar as
both are speech. Second, the spectral and temporal properties of multi-talker babble change with time and are
therefore difficult to predict.
 Despite these challenges, we developed an extremely effective algorithm called SEDA to remove
babble. SEDA improved understanding of speech in babble at all signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) tested by an
average of 26 percentage points (or 38 points, when normalized with respect to hearing in quiet). In contrast, a
commercial NR algorithm (ClearVoice from Advanced Bionics) provided little to no detectable benefit.
 In a successful Phase 2, we produced a commercially viable implementation of SEDA. Nevertheless,
significant work is required to bring SEDA to commercial readiness. The Aims below were developed in
conjunction with CI manufacturers to facilitate SEDA technology for licensing by CI manufacturers.
 Aim 1: Evaluate SEDA in non-babble listening situations. At minimum, SEDA must be beneficial
with babble and not detrimental in other listening situations if it is to be commercially implemented into a CI.
Therefore, we will evaluate the effect of SEDA in non-babble auditory scenes using speech recognition,
listener preference, and a computational metric.
 Aim 2: Interrogate benefits of SEDA relative to commercial offerings from CI manufacturers. We
will compare the effectiveness of SEDA with NR from Advanced Bionics, MED-EL, Cochlear, and Oticon
Medical on understating speech in babble, white, and speech-shaped noise.
 Aim 3: Obtain real-world feedback from at home evaluations of SEDA. We will send patients home
for a month with SEDA to collect feedback and to ascertain unexpected issues or listening situations to be
addressed.
 Aim 4: Quantify the effects of computational trade-offs on SEDA performance. We will modify the
number of parameters used in SEDA to adjust the computational requirements. Using a computational metric
and speech recognition, we will evaluate the effects of the of these changes on SEDA’s performance."
10874261,"The CDC reports that fungal infections are responsible for ~9 million outpatient visits, ~75,000 hospitalizations

fungal infections to improve patient health. Studies strongly support that invasive candidiasis originates from the
gut, but the events encompassing invasive candidiasis (e.g., cues regulating yeast to hypha shift) are unclear.
Chloride (Cl–)-driven fluid secretion represents a potent host defense mechanism for clearing gut pathogens.
Despite its public health importance, the regulation of fluid secretion is not well studied. We have shown that
protein kinase C (PKC) mediated endocytosis of the basolateral Na+-K+-2Cl– cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) is probably
the main pathway blunting Cl– secretion. Our broad objectives are to define the mechanistic details of Cl–
secretion regulation in normal and in the pathological context of invasive candidiasis. To answer those questions,
we have established the following goals: (i) Define the role of E2 (at blood level found in critically ill patients) on
the regulation of yeast to hypha shift in C. albicans, (ii) elucidate the posttranslational signal causing
internalization of NKCC1 and its fate in the endocytic pathway and (iii) demonstrate that C. albicans subverts the
PKC-mediated NKCC1 endocytosis to inhibit Cl– secretion. Our central hypothesis is that during sepsis and in ill
patients C. albicans subverts Cl–-mediated fluid secretion by increasing NKCC1 internalization to gain an
advantage before cell invasion. The rationale of our study is that without a firm understanding of those events it
will be difficult to combat and improve patient health during invasive candidiasis. We will test our hypothesis by
addressing the following specific aims: 1) Is 17-β estradiol (E2) regulating C. albicans morphology shift? We will
use bright field microscopy to monitor C. albicans morphology during the exposure of E2 2) Is NKCC1
ubiquitination, after PKC activation, responsible for its internalization and what is the fate of internalized NKCC1?
We will (i) test for the ubiquitination of NKCC1 after PKC activation by immunoblot and (ii) use fluorescence
microscopy and endocytic markers to map NKCC1 in the endocytic pathway to check if it is recycled or degraded.
3) Is PKC-mediated NKCC1 internalization the cellular mechanism subverted by C. albicans to decrease fluid
secretion in colonic epithelial cells? We will (i) use biochemical and fluorescence techniques to monitor NKCC1
membrane expression during C. albicans infection in presence or absence of PKC inhibitors and (ii) use the
short circuit current to measure Cl– secretion, during C. albicans infection in presence or absence of PKC
inhibitors. Our work is innovative because a) it proposes to establish for the first time that pathological
concentration of E2 modulates C. albicans virulence and b) provides new insight on mechanisms prior cell
invasion, which have been long overlooked. Our application is significant because the outcomes will expand our
knowledge on the cellular events surrounding C. albicans infection in the gut epithelium and help future research
to design better drugs/therapies against invasive candidiasis in the gut and other organs (e.g., vagina, skin)."

Tamoxifen (TMX) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) approved by FDA for treatment of
estrogen receptor positive (ER+) early stage and advanced breast cancer. Although TMX is the mainstay
of breast cancer treatment, 20-30% of of breast cancer patients exhibit an existing or developing
resistance to TMX therapy with cancer metastsis, by poorly understood mechanisms. Therefore an
understanding of molecular mechanisms and predictive correlates of these pathological effects
associated with TMX treatment will help design improved adjuvant therapies to overcome TMX resistance
and related pathologies for effective management of breast cancer. In this regard, we recently reported
that TMX induces robust formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are DNA fibrils exuded
from activated neutrophils that can trap and kill extracellular pathogens to boost antimicrobial host
defense in chronic granulomatous disease. However, unconstrained NET release has been linked to
several immunopathologies including cancer. Because breast cancer patients are typically prescribed
TMX as the first or second line therapy, we hypothesize that long-term TMX treatment induces NET
formation in these patients, which correlates with and can account for TMX resistance and cancer
metastasis. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary data showing that the extent of NET formation
in breast cancer patients is directly proportional to the duration of TMX treatment and that NETs purified
from TMX treated breast cancer patients increase cancer cell survival. Leveraging a characterized large
cohort of breast cancer patients treated with TMX at MD Anderson Cancer Center, in this clinical
exploratory study we will quantify and characterize NETs in blood samples from pre- and post-
menopausal women diagnosed with ERα+ breast cancer receiving TMX therapy for varying durations of
time, and correlate it with clinical data on co-morbidities, cancer metastasis and recurrence (Aim 1a). We
will examine the phenotype and transcriptional landscape of neutrophils from these patients with a focus
on TMX-activated NET pathway dentified by us (Aim 1b). Lastly, we will determine the direct impact of
TMX-induced NETs on survival and transcriptional reprogramming of breast cancer cells in response to
tamoxifen exposure (Aim 2). Because the NET-inducing action of TMX in breast cancer patients and its
impact on breast cancer cells as it relates to tamoxifen resistance is completely unknown, our proposed
studies will provide novel insights into the mechanism of tamoxifen resistance and future therapeutic
opportunities to prevent cancer metastasis and other adverse effects of TMX."

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Sam1, and its paralog Sam2, play roles in the methyl cycle catalyzing the
biosynthesis of AdoMet. Despite Sam1 and Sam2 having high levels of homology and findings that both proteins
localize to the cytoplasm, differences in abundance and regulation of expression speak to the differential function
and use of these proteins by the cell. In humans, three genes, MAT1A, MAT2A, and MAT2B, encode subunits
of the homologous AdoMet synthetases. These genes, and their product AdoMet, have been implicated in
multiple cancer types, but the mechanism of action is not well understood because both increases and decreases
in expression are associated with cancers. Our group has conducted studies of SAM gene dosage and
determined the impacts of changes in AdoMet synthetase genes on genome stability. SAM1 and SAM2 clearly
operate by two distinct mechanisms to impart different impacts on genome stability. This proposal contains the
next logical steps to improve our understanding of the SAM genes and impacts of changes to the methyl cycle
on cellular processes including genome stability. Through the first iteration of this grant, we have found that the
increased instability in sam2Δ/sam2Δ cells is linked to increased dNTP levels, and studies proposed here aim
to define the mechanism of increased dNTPs and how they increase recombination and breakage/NDJ events.
We also found that the increased stability in sam1Δ/sam1Δ cells is not due to increased GSH or polyamines, or
decreased ROS, and therefore hypothesize stability may come from the increased AdoMet levels in methylations
or via suppressing more reactive methyl donors. We seek to define the protective effects of increased AdoMet,
as well as changes in the proteomes of our mutants due to changes in AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase
function. We also propose studies to better understand the regulation and functionality of the Sam1 and Sam2
proteins, to provide context to the opposite effects observed due to loss of one or the other. Together, these
studies will aid our understanding of the differences in the roles of the unlinked SAM1 and SAM2 genes and how
altered expression of the homologous genes and/or changes in AdoMet levels might be implicated in disease
development and treatments. Finally, these studies will train numerous undergraduate students in hypothesis-
based research utilizing the genetically malleable yeast system ideal for teaching genetics and molecular biology
and focusing on their development as scientists and scientifically literate citizens. This proposal meets the stated
objectives of the R15 AREA program by involving undergraduate students in hypothesis driven research and
strengthening the research environment at NKU."

Montana Occupational Health & Safety Surveillance (MOHSS)
PAR-20-312
Project Summary
The Montana Occupational Health and Safety Surveillance (MOHSS) program works to accomplish three
main goals in order bridge the gap between occupational health surveillance and prevention and safety
activities. MOHSS accomplishes this through three primary activities that all together can provide
valuable information and lead to occupational health improvement across the state. Expected outputs
of the program include reports, publications, presentations, award, policies, and legislation that will lead
to the outcomes of reduced workplace injuries, illness, and fatalities.
The program collects, reports, and analyzes the Occupational Health Indicators as a baseline for
occupational health surveillance. The indicators collected on an annual basis allow for an analysis of
trends in occupational health. They are used to monitor Montana’s occupational safety and health
landscape, reveal areas in need of more in-depth surveillance, and guide prevention efforts.
MOHSS also uses interagency collaborations to improve the quantity and quality of occupational health
data collected and used for surveillance. MOHSS works to improve access to and quality of existing
systems as well as explore new data sources. In order to accomplish this, MOHSS collaborates with other
agencies and bureaus within Montana to take advantage of the large variety of surveillance systems
already in place. These include the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services, Montana
Department of Transportation, Montana Department of Environmental Quality, Montana university
system, and other outside organizations. The collaborations allow for research on emerging issues such
as COVID-19 and new occupational safety and health topics like Total Worker Health.
Finally, MOHSS creates and maintains active communication with stakeholders in occupational safety
and health to provide avenues through which information from MOHSS research can reach agencies
who are able to act on the findings. Findings from MOHSS guide interventions and preventative policy
targeting occupational health and safety hazards most efficiently. These relationships also provide
external guidance to MOHSS and provide council on aspects of occupational health of particular
importance or concern."
10877681,"The proposed program objectives are to: 1) Recruit and maintain a steady state of 11
highly diverse pre-doctoral trainees in our established training program focused on health
services research (HSR) related to addiction, HIV, HCV and implementation science; 2)
Mentor trainees in the conduct of clinical, outcomes, and implementation studies in HSR,
particularly related to integrated approaches to service delivery for substance use, HIV,
and HCV; and 3) Prepare trainees to disseminate research findings and translate them
into practice and policy as they launch careers in addiction-related HSR. Major advances
in HIV/AIDS treatment have made HIV a chronic, lifelong disease requiring ongoing care
and management; new developments in HCV offer dramatic opportunity for cure; and
new models of treatment for addiction have created the opportunity for significantly
improved outcomes in the midst of an opioid overdose epidemic. Addiction, HIV and HCV
commonly co-occur, requiring integration of care; few researchers have been prepared
to pursue this research agenda. We will continue a successful interdisciplinary pre-
doctoral training program, “Integrated Care for Addiction, HIV and HCV Research and
Education (ICAHRE)” within the PhD program in Health Services Research in the
Department of Health Law, Policy & Management (HLPM) at the Boston University
School of Public Health (BUSPH), in partnership with the Boston University School of
Medicine (BUSM) and Boston Medical Center (BMC). The formal training period will
encompass the coursework phase of the trainee's doctoral degree program, requiring
HSR theory and methods courses, enhanced by courses in addictions and/or infectious
disease, and implementation science. ICAHRE includes research seminars, research
rotations, and both didactic and experiential training in the communication of science to
multiple audiences. Mentored research training will lead to grant submission and
dissertation (PhD) completion. Given BUSPH’s focus on the underserved, long track
record of productive scholarship, strength in training and mentoring, history of
interdisciplinary collaboration, and institutional resources and leadership, we will
continue to train researchers to address some of our nation’s most challenging health
care problems. Our faculty brings substantial knowledge in addiction, HIV, HCV and
different approaches to HSR, including using both qualitative and quantitative research
methods."

than ten years. In close collaboration with FDA's Office of Training Education and
Development (OTED), along with long-time collaborators including the Association of
Food and Drug Officials (AFDO), the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA),
and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), IFPTI will continue to lead the
development of the NCS through the continued buildout of the Integrated Food Safety
System (IFSS) Curriculum Framework and its sub-frameworks (Manufactured, Retail, and
Animal Food); the development of new curriculum frameworks as directed by OTED, and
the development of an enhanced version of the Interactive National Curriculum Standard
that will allow for real-time updating of competencies and behavioral anchors developed
during IFPTI-facilitated Subject Matter Expert focus groups.
As content and program areas within the curriculum frameworks are built out, IFPTI will
incorporate the competencies and behavioral anchors into course blueprints and course
design documents, which will form the foundation for the development and delivery of
knowledge-based eLearning and performance-based learning experiences. The course
blueprints and design documents will adhere to OTED specifications, and eLearning
courses will be programmed using the Lectora content authoring tool.
IFPTI will collaborate with APHL to develop and deliver a Leadership Program based on
the Leadership Level competencies in the IFSS and Laboratory Curriculum Frameworks.
Additionally, IFPTI will continue to deliver its flagship program, the Fellowship in Food
Protection: Leadership Development for the Integrated Food Safety System. Eight
Cohorts have successfully completed the Fellowship, with the majority of Fellows
advancing their careers in food safety. IFPTI will also continue to deliver the Instructor
Skills Training program, on a quarterly basis, to both FDA trainers and non-FDA trainers
who deliver FDA courses. The Instructor Skills Training will also include newly developed
modules devoted to virtual instruction and enhanced facilitation skills.
IFPTI will continue to advance the NCS through a series of outreach and coordination
activities, including attendance at stakeholder meetings and conferences, the submission
of papers and articles for publication, and the delivery of presentations on the NCS. IFPTI
will also collaborate with OTED on the standardization of an instructor management
process and the course design and delivery process. Additionally, IFPTI will facilitate
regularly scheduled Tactical Meetings among Cooperative Agreement recipients in order
to leverage resources and avoid redundancy of effort."
10877685,"This application requests continued support for the tri-institutional Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) at
Stony Brook University, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and Brookhaven National Laboratory. Continuously
supported by the NIGMS since 1992, our MSTP has almost a 40-year history of training physician-scientists,
many of whom have gone on to make important discoveries and become leaders in biomedical research at
academic medical centers across the country. Of our 111 graduates thus far, 43% are still in training, all in strong
academic medical programs. Of the remaining graduates, 71% have academic faculty positions, many of which
are highly prestigious, or are affiliated with university hospitals, NIH, or biotechnology / pharmaceutical groups,
and another 11% are primarily clinical but contribute as educators and have academic connections. The goal of
the program is to provide a rigorous training path that creates and fosters a physician-scientist mentality and a
culture that imbues trainees with the tools, motivation, identity, and drive to pursue careers in academic medicine.
Students are exposed to both clinical and basic scientific activities throughout their training, reinforcing the
special nature of this program. Core courses unique to our MSTP include monthly seminar / dinners with both
internal and external physician-scientist speakers, and a monthly journal club – clinical pathological correlation
dinner-evening that combines basic science with clinical applications in an active-learning manner. Our students
participate in mini-courses in our unique Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science. PhD degrees are offered
in a wide range of disciplines with the students being guided to undertake high-quality basic / translational
science training to address problems relevant to human health. Since the last review, there have been many
changes at SBU including (i) the recruitment of new MD and MD-PhD physician-scientists as Chairs of the major
clinical departments and (iv) a $450M construction of a Cancer Center and Children’s Hospital. The MSTP has
grown from 40 students 10 years ago to 58 at the last renewal and now 63, annual institutional support to the
MSTP has correspondingly increased, the applicant pool size has remained stable, and both applicant and
matriculant quality have increased substantially. In 2017/18, we matriculated 7 students (and we typically add
another student from the existing medical school class). Many of our students hold individual NRSAs, publish
high-impact articles, and have received a variety of honors, both intra- and extramurally. Overall time-to-
graduation has averaged 8.05 years over the past decade. On average, MSTPs receive support for 25% of the
funding years; in this application, we thus request that level of support, i.e. 16 lines. We are committed to the

established physicians and scientists with extensive administrative experience who, along with 30 basic
scientists and translational investigators, serve as mentors. Our training program is scaffolded by a highly
integrated collaborative well-resourced research environment with a 360-degree evaluation system
surrounding our Signature Programs, specific areas of scientific excellence in 1) atherosclerosis,
thrombosis, and vascular biology, 2) cardiac biology and heart failure, 3) precision cardiovascular medicine,
and 4) hypertension. Our program emphasizes critical components designed to launch/sustain independent
research careers: 1) 3 years of support to enable grant (re)submissions, 2) individualized development plans
(IDP), 3) protected research time, 4) multidisciplinary mentoring teams, 5) training in core competencies ,
and 6) industry/biotechnology or scientific liaison career options for trainees not pursuing a traditional career
in academia. A rigorous nationwide selection process aids in our diverse trainee selection and team
mentoring is optimized using innovative tools (e.g., DiSC® and career path assessments). The IDP includes
foundational elements of progressive responsibility, coordination across multiple levels of translation,
interactions with cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular scientists, near-peer learning opportunities, specific
coursework, seminars, and conferences. Our long-term benchmark/goal is for more than 50% of our
postdoctoral trainees to transition into competitive faculty positions within 3 to 5 years of exiting our program.
Our intermediate benchmarks include publications, presentations, and grant submissio ns. Along with the
Directors, an Executive Committee and External Advisory Committee that have extensive experience with
career development, leadership, and directing training grants all provide program oversight and monitor
trainee progress every 6 and 12 months. Overall, the ultimate goal of our training program is to train the

In order to perform some of their most important functions, cells must be able to generate, sense, and
respond to mechanical forces. Many “mechanosensing” proteins have been discovered that are
believed to change their behavior in a predictable and repeatable way when under mechanical tension.
Yet, in most of these cases, we don’t know the molecular basis of how this force shifts the
conformations adopted by the protein, or how this then leads to a concomitant change function. The
molecular basis of mechanosensing can in principle be predicted using molecular simulation
techniques, however this approach has either not been employed or not been successful because of
the small magnitude of forces involved and the large size and complexity of the mechanosensors. In
this work, we will develop a set of new simulation methodologies to properly sample protein
conformations and protein-ligand biding lifetimes at a range of small forces. We will employ these
techniques to study mechanosensing in three different contexts where we believe three distinct
mechanisms for changing behavior in response to force are employed. Overall, the work in these
studies will lead to a much greater understanding of the molecular paradigms used by cells to regulate
their behavior in response to mechanical stimuli, and expand our simulation toolbox to be able to
properly sample and assess their response to physiologically small forces."

 Regulated proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (ubiquitin system) plays essential roles in
a multitude of biological processes and has major ramifications for human health and disease, including
illnesses that range from cancer and neurodegeneration to cardiovascular syndromes and defects of
immunity. Our studies of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and ubiquitin-dependent N-degron pathways
(previously called “N-end rule pathways”) over more than three decades were made possible, to a large
extent, by the present grant (DK039520), currently in its 34th year of support. N-degron pathways
recognize proteins containing N-terminal (Nt) degradation signals called N-degrons, polyubiquitylate these
proteins and thereby cause their degradation by the proteasome or autophagy. Recognition components of
N-degron pathways, called N-recognins, are E3 ubiquitin ligases that can target N-degrons. One eukaryotic
N-degron pathway, called the Arg/N-degron pathway, targets, in particular, specific unmodified Nt-residues
of protein substrates. Another Nt-proteolytic system, called the Pro/N-degron pathway, recognizes, in
particular, the Nt-proline (Pro) residue of protein substrates.
 This DK039520 renewal application stems from our unpublished studies over the last ~2 years, and
focuses on the yeast (S. cerevisiae) Pro/N-degron and Arg/N-degron pathways, including the functions of
specific aminopeptidases and the recently discovered ability of Ubr1, the E3 of the Arg/N-degron pathway,
to target not only N-degrons but also C-degrons. These and related studies, described in Specific Aims of
the DK039520 renewal application, will advance the understanding of protein degradation and the
universally present (as well as medically significant) N-degron pathways."
10887977,"Degeneration of the intervertebral disc (IVD) is associated with changes to tissue composition and structure
that include a loss of IVD height, decreased water content and decreased cellularity. Therapies based on
supplementing degenerated IVD with mesenchymal stem or progenitor cells (MSC) have been widely explored
for MSCs’ ability to secrete factors that contribute to cell survival, tissue repair and blunted inflammation.
However, cells delivered without a carrier have short residence times in the tissue and are associated with a
limited ability to repair the tissue. Strategies that promote MSC survival and localization in the IVD, such as
injectable cell carriers and the addition of growth factors to promote MSC survival and biosynthesis are
important to enable the true potential of cellular repair strategies.
We aim to develop injectable, cell adhesive and growth factor presenting alginate hydrogels that
unlock the reparative potential of MSCs to repair the disc. Many engineered cell carriers seek to reproduce
the presence of cell-adhesive sites in the native extracellular matrix (ECM), by including full-length ECM
proteins or short cell-adhesive peptides. Natural ECM also sequesters growth factors, including Insulin Like
Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) which promotes MSC survival and drives matrix synthesis by cells endogenous to the
IVD. We propose to modify alginate gels to present both integrin-binding cyclic RGD peptides as well as
tethered short peptides that mimic IGF-1. We hypothesize that combined presentation of cyclic RGD and IGF-1
mimicking peptides from MSC-encapsulating alginate gels will protect the MSC from apoptosis and
inflammation in the hostile environment of the degenerative IVD, and enhance MSCs’ ability to promote
survival and production of healthy ECM by resident cells of the IVD.
We will test this hypothesis with in vitro studies of MSCs encapsulated in optimized peptide-modified alginate
carriers, co-cultured with primary cells derived from human degenerative IVDs. We will also perform in vivo
studies of human MSC encapsulation in optimized peptide-modified alginate carriers for transplantation into
degenerated lumbar IVDs of the RNU rat. We expect the delivery of gel-encapsulated MSCs to induce IVD
repair through activation of both cell adhesive and IGF-1 signaling pathways that promote MSCs’ secretion of
cytokines for new ECM synthesis and blunted inflammation. Measures of IVD quality and single cell RNAseq
will be obtained in the degenerated and treated rat IVDs to reveal the key populations and subpopulations of
host cells that mediate pathology in IVD degeneration and those that are altered in response to MSC therapy."
10887979,"ABSTRACT
 The evolution of PC (layer of proteins/biomolecules that adsorbs at the surface of NPs upon contact by
biological fluids) in vivo still remains highly challenging due to the complexity of human physiology, the complex
nature of the biomolecules adsorbs on the surface, which is one of the main barriers of clinical translation of
nanomaterials. The ex vivo approaches for preparation of PC on the surface of the model NPs do not provide
homogenous corona formation as commonly perceived in the literature and the composition of the PC varies
even across identical NPs with the same sizes in the same batch and using the same biological fluid. The current
available PC characterizations or isolation techniques are not able to detect small variations in the composition
of the PC and heterogeneity of the PC structure. Therefore, non-specific extraction and pool analysis of the PC
in ex vivo condition may cause error and/or misinterpretation of the PC outcomes which significantly influence
the clinical translation of NPs. We show in the preliminary data that although the standard MagLev systems are
able to separate PC coated and uncoated NPs however, it is not able to discriminate among PC coated NPs
with various PC composition at the surface of the NPs due their very similar density and low resolution of the
standard MagLev systems. In this exploratory research we aim to develop a higher sensitivity MagLev system
to show the heterogeneity and variation of PC composition on the surface of the NPs, a critical ignored factor in
clinical translation of nanomaterials and failures of nanomedicine. In such highly sensitive MagLev configuration,
the resolution enhances 1 to 3 orders of magnitude (compared with sensitivity of standard MagLev system (i.e.,
10-3 g/cm3)) which is high enough to separate PC coated NPs with different PC coverages/compositions (e.g.,
number and type of the proteins at the surface) and very slight differences in the density (ranging from 0.001
g/cm3 to 0.00001 g/cm3 which is not detectable using standard MagLev system). Our preliminary data using a
prototype high sensitivity MagLev system as proof-of-concept, confirms that how identical objects (i.e.,
commercial identical nylon particles) with the same density and levitation heights in the standard MagLev system
have significant different levitation heights in a high sensitivity (prototype) MagLev system indicating low
resolution of the standard of the MagLev systems to detect such small variations/changes. The current state-of-
the-art in this type of separation is that there are simple proofs-of-concept of many of its foundational concepts,
but little use of fully developed methods by biologists and clinicians. This project will both solidify the fundamental
biophysical science of MagLev as a simple analytical tool in biochemistry and provide demonstrations of uses
for nanomedicine applications."

Engaging High School Students in Exploring Biomedical Science Careers by Connecting
 with Counter-Stereotypical Scientists
Project Summary/Abstract
Extending the work of the successful NIH SEPA-funded Scientist Spotlights Initiative, San
Francisco State University – in partnership with Foothill College and University of Georgia –
aims to expand collaborations with high school teachers to be nationwide, connect high school
students with near peer undergraduate student mentors from diverse backgrounds, and
investigate the impact of engaging high school students as authors of Scientist Spotlights in the
new Scientist Spotlights Partnership Program. Few high school students have access to
biomedical scientists; even fewer have insights into their personal backgrounds and professional
journeys. Research on science identity, stereotypes, and career interests suggests that lack of
access to diverse representations of scientists is a key barrier for high school students envisioning
themselves in biomedical research careers, especially for students from populations marginalized
in science. Yet, bringing scientists directly into classrooms is not possible for many teachers,
would not provide access to biomedical role models at scale, and may inadvertently reinforce
stereotypes about who can pursue biomedical science. To increase representation of diverse
biomedical science role models in high school science curriculum, we previously developed
hundreds of Scientist Spotlights – metacognitive curriculum supplements that align with high
school NGSS content standards, highlight the stories and research of counter-stereotypical
biomedical scientists, and are reflective assignments completed by high school students. Faculty
and undergraduate students authored Scientist Spotlights were freely available on the Scientist
Spotlights Initiative website for teachers to use. Research results from prior efforts demonstrated
increases in high school students’ science identity and relatability to scientists after experiencing
only three Scientist Spotlights, and we unexpectedly observed even more dramatic positive
impacts for undergraduate students who authored Scientist Spotlights. To leverage these results,
we now propose to engage high school students themselves in exploring biomedical research
careers by potentially interviewing scientists and authoring Scientist Spotlights. To accomplish
this, we will partner high school teachers with undergraduate near peer mentors to guide the
authoring process as well as to collaborate in assessing impact on high school students. Over 5
years, we aim to collaborate with ~40 teachers, ~80 near peer mentors, and ~1280 high school
students who will have agency to identify, interview, and author Scientist Spotlights, which will
be disseminated on the Scientist Spotlights Initiative website. Finally, we will conduct research to
compare the impact of authoring versus just experiencing Scientist Spotlights assignments on
high school students’ science identity, relatability to scientists, and career interests."

Even without comorbidities associated with aging, wound healing in healthy elderly people (>65)
is delayed, posing a high risk of infection. However, mechanisms for the age-related decline in
wound healing are largely unknown. Integrin adhesion receptors on epidermal keratinocytes bind
to extracellular matrix (ECM) and have critical roles in controlling the wound microenvironment
and critical parameters of wound healing. Age-dependent changes in adhesion receptors may
contribute to reduced wound healing in aged skin, but these have not been explored. This is an
important knowledge gap, as integrins are cell surface receptors that can be readily targetable
therapeutically. Integrin α3β1 is an excellent candidate for mediating epidermal wound functions
that diminish with age. Indeed, our preliminary data show that α3β1 expression decreases in
aging murine skin. Furthermore, our new genetic model of inducible, epidermis-specific α3KO
(iα3eKO) has begun to elucidate α3β1-dependent wound functions in adult skin, free from
compensation and/or basement membrane defects caused by embryonic and sustained deletion
of epidermal α3β1 in the widely used constitutive α3KO mice. Our preliminary data indicate that
acute loss of α3β1 in epidermis of young adult mice (1) slows wound reepithelialization and (2)
impairs epidermal factors that mediate immune cell infiltration. Indeed, reepithelialization and
immune cell infiltration are compromised in aging skin of humans and rodents, and contribute to
impaired wound healing in the elderly. The proposed work will use an aging model in combination
with our iα3eKO model to test our hypothesis that α3β1 in epidermis promotes wound healing
by regulating two distinct processes: (1) epidermal migration over the provisional wound
ECM, and (2) induction of epidermal factors that mediate immune cell infiltration, and that
these α3β1-dependent functions are diminished during intrinsic (chronological) aging,
impeding the ability to heal wounds. We propose two Specific Aims to test our hypothesis and
answer the question: Does waning epidermal integrin α3β1 function in aging skin contribute to
wound healing deficiencies in the elderly? We will determine, in vivo and in vitro, the ability of
young, middle, and aged keratinocytes which express or lack α3β1 to (Aim 1) proliferate and
migrate during re-epithelialization, and to (Aim 2) secrete soluble immune cell-stimulating factors
that promote immune cell recruitment during wound healing. Aim 2 is a particularly innovative
aspect, as it extends our studies beyond traditional roles for integrins in adhesion/motility to further
explore keratinocyte-driven paracrine crosstalk. This work will enhance understanding of how
age-related changes in the functions of epidermal integrins contribute to reduced wound healing."

A hallmark of functional motor skill is adaptability—tailoring movements to changes in the body or environment.
The proposed project focuses on adaptability in infant walking because infants must learn to walk in the midst of
continual changes in their bodies and environments. Changes in the body (due to physical growth, carrying
objects, footwear, etc.) and environment (varying ground surfaces, obstacles, etc.) alter the biomechanical
constraints on balance, propulsion, and braking. Moreover, walking is a foundational motor skill, endemic in
everyday activity, and central to clinical assessment and intervention.
The central hypothesis is that infants acquire adaptability via everyday walking experience. That is, infants
learn strategies for modifying their walking patterns (footfalls and joint angles) as they navigate an ever-changing
environment in a continually changing body. A century of research shows that infants’ age and everyday walking
experience (elapsed time since walk onset) predict their skill when walking barefoot over flat ground. But little
work examined infants’ ability to modify their walking patterns (speed, step length, joint angles, etc.) to cope with
changes in their body or environment. Thus, the proposed project fills an empirical gap in scientific knowledge
that is fundamental to developmental theory.
The proposed experiment tests the role of everyday walking experience in the development of
adaptability in infant walking. Because age and walking experience are confounded, the proposed experiment
uses a within-subjects, age-held-constant design—all 14-month-old infants to control for age while walking
experience (0-4 months) varies freely. Infants will be tested in a baseline condition (walking barefoot over a flat
walkway) and in 4 novel conditions that require adaptability—2 body conditions (walking over a flat walkway
wearing shoes that tilt their toes 10° up or 10° down); and 2 environment conditions (walking barefoot over a
sloping walkway tilted 10° up or 10° down). The shoe conditions affect infants’ balance; the slope conditions
affect balance, propulsion, and braking. Spatiotemporal footfall measures, joint angles, and gait disruptions will
characterize how infants modify their walking to cope with the novel challenges.
Aim 1 tests whether infants display different walking patterns in each condition, and whether walking experience
is related to the type and diversity of patterns. Aim 2 assesses the similarity in walking between conditions for
each infant, and tests whether walking experience amplifies the similarity or dissimilarity between conditions.
Both aims leverage the power of machine learning analyses (density peak clustering and similarity matrices) to
fully characterize infants’ walking within and across conditions. The within-subjects, age-held-constant design,
innovative body-environment test conditions, and analytic techniques provide a strong test of the long-term
objective: to understand the role of experience in the development of adaptability in infant motor skill. Findings
promise to inform early intervention practices to support children’s locomotor development."
10890151,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most aggressive hematologic malignancies in adults, yet decades-
old chemotherapies remain the standard of care and few targeted therapies exist owing to its molecular and
clinical heterogeneity. An emerging hallmark of AML development is the epigenetic silencing of LINE1
retrotransposons which is required to maintain AML self-renewal, differentiation blockade, and genomic stability.
Aberrant reactivation of LINE1 retrotransposons selectively impairs propagation of human and mouse AML cells
without affecting normal hematopoiesis; however, it remains elusive how LINE1 activity inhibits myeloid
leukemogenesis. Aberrant retrotransposon reactivation by cancer-targeting epigenetic inhibitors such as DNA
hypomethylating agents (DMA) produces a type I interferon (IFN)-mediated ‘viral mimicry’ response in various
cancer types, including leukemias, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We hypothesize that LINE1
retrotransposons contribute to the development of myeloid leukemia by modulating type I interferon signaling
mediated by cGAS and/or RIG-I-like Receptor (RLR) sensing of LINE1 gene products. This proposal will
establish the functional role of LINE1-mediated IFN signaling in myeloid leukemogenesis and determine the
mechanisms by which LINE1 activates innate immune ‘viral mimicry’ pathways in AML cells. The Specific Aims
of this proposal intend to 1) establish the functional role of LINE1-mediated interferon signaling in myeloid
leukemogenesis and progression; and 2) identify the molecular sensors of LINE1-mediated interferon activation
in AML. Ectopic LINE1 overexpression and CRISPR activation of endogenous LINE1s in human AML cells will
determine whether LINE1 expression induces type I IFNs and impacts cell proliferation, myeloid differentiation,
and/or apoptosis. Combining a conditional LINE1 activation transgenic mouse with the established MLL-AF9
retroviral leukemia model will determine whether activation of LINE1s induces hematopoietic-specific type I IFN
to impair AML initiation and/or maintenance in vivo. Moreover, genetic ablation of cGAS, RIG-I, or MDA5 nucleic
acid sensors individually or in combination in human AML cells and their corresponding knockout mouse models
will determine how loss of DNA- and/or RNA-sensing pathways affects LINE1-induced inflammation and AML
pathogenesis in vivo. Altogether, these stringent genetic studies will provide direct evidence to establish the
functional role of LINE1-mediated IFN signaling in myeloid leukemia. Addressing these outstanding knowledge
gaps will be critical to inform whether and how modulation of the retrotransposon-innate immunity crosstalk may
be leveraged as a new mechanism-based therapeutic strategy to selectively eradicate AML cells."
10888938,"Project Summary/Abstract Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) comprise of a group of disorders
associated with abnormal brain development, leading to abnormal brain function of language, motor, behavior,
memory and learning. NDDs, e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) and intellectual disability, affect approximately 15% of children in the United States and pose a
significant public health burden on society. The causes of NDDs are still largely unknown. A growing body of
evidence support that most NDDs are result from a combination of genetic, biological, psychosocial and
environmental risk factors rather than any single origin. Furthermore, there are high rates of co-occurrence
between different NDDs, as well as similarities in functional impairment and clinical features, which make the
diagnosis and treatment of NDDs difficult. Hemispheric asymmetry is a core element of the brain’s usual
organization required for optimal functioning and a key landmark of brain development. We have recently
revealed that brain asymmetry is closely associated with NDDs and their genetic/environmental risk factors
and clinical features, though the causal interacting relationships are unclear. Here we hypothesize that the
biological process of brain asymmetry development is influenced by complex genetic and environmental
contributors for NDDs, and different dysregulations of this multifactorial dynamic system may mediate the
emergence of different clinical symptoms/behaviors in NDDs. Previous studies of brain asymmetry in NDDs
are limited by the case-control and cross-sectional study designs, and the factors contributing to NDDs have
yet to be studied using an integrative method. This proposal seeks to overcome the limitations of previous
studies by applying our novel integrative analytic algorithms and a transdiagnostic approach to several existing
public and internal longitudinal (and cross-sectional) datasets (total N~16,000), which are designed for
studying brain development and related health issues and comprise extensive data of demographics, medical
records, behavioral/clinical assessments, cognitive tests, genetics, and multimodal brain imaging. The
proposed analyses seek to address the following aims: 1) Model the developmental mechanisms of brain
asymmetry involving spatiotemporal interactions between multimodal brain asymmetry components, genetic
and environmental influences and this system’s impact on children behavior/cognition in typically and atypically
developing children and adolescents over time, and 2) characterize within-diagnoses trajectories and cluster
biologically similar participants cutting across conventional diagnostic boundaries to understand both shared
and distinct developmental trajectories of brain asymmetry and behavior/cognition in NDDs. Our study has the
potential to provide definitive neurobiological models of NDDs, with practical implications for helping in
reformulating current diagnostic categories of NDDs with novel disorder definitions rooted in the biology of
neurodevelopment processes, and in identifying predictive biomarkers for diagnosis and the right time window
for proper intervention/treatment."

In this project, we leverage the motivating theme of “Superheroes” to highlight the work of
biomedical engineers, biotechnologists, and other medical technologists, whose work in
engineering design and problem-solving using scientific data and readings is exciting and
important. The overarching goal of the Biomedical Engineering Superheroes is to develop
curricular resources and outreach activities to support educational activities that encourage
students from diverse backgrounds to consider pursuing further studies or careers in engineering
and scientific research. This Curriculum Development and Outreach project will also integrate
health science content, engineering design skills, data science, and reading. The Biomedical
Engineering Superheroes program will include curricular units that demonstrate how we can fight
against four common conditions or diseases. The curricular units will focus on four of the mission
areas (the fantastic four) of the NIH Institutes and Centers- obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and
kidney disease based on data that demonstrated how prevalent and thus culturally relevant these
public health issues are to families. The Biomedical Engineering Superheroes curricular program
will be designed to include 18 hours of academic content over five Saturdays (not including a 3-
hour, community-public health fair).
The following three major aims will guide this project for the next five years: (1) to develop
community co-constructed, culturally-responsive, curricular activities with biomedical and data
science experts and teachers addressing fifth-grade students’ science learning and language and
identity development needs. (2) to provide a health science STEM education professional
development model that includes experiences for elementary school teachers that focus on
increasing their knowledge of science and engineering concepts related to health science,
biomedical engineering, and linguistic-culturally responsive pedagogical approaches for teaching
STEM and 3) to deliver a STEM outreach program to elementary-aged students comprised of 4
units that focus on obesity, diabetes, kidney disease, and heart disease. Outputs: Over the five-
year funding period, 48 teachers will participate in training & lead the Biomedical Engineering
Superheroes sessions; 48 college students will participate as Peer Mentors; More than 500
Elementary students from eight low-income school districts will participate in weekend academic
programming and more than 400 family members participate in the family public health community
fairs."
10888844,"Project Summary
A diverse U.S. healthcare workforce, including gender, race, ethnicity, and intersectional identities, is needed to 
ensure access to quality and relevant healthcare for all populations. Although this diversity in healthcare and 
health careers is crucial, researchers have documented that talented minoritized students often face systemic 
barriers that prevent them from thriving in their chosen profession. Educational interventions such as pathway 
programs have sought to improve access to medical careers; however, many programs are either too late 
(focusing solely on the undergraduate level), lack exposure to medical school curricula (such as problem-based 
learning), and/or lack follow-up support and critical coaching when students enter college or professional
school. New approaches that break down these systemic barriers are urgently needed. Our SEPA project has an 
intentional program design to reduce disparities in students’ social capital (inherited and acquired) to enable 
student success in medical and health education. We hypothesize that increasing high school students' social 
capital will reduce the barriers to health careers. We propose two specific methods for increasing student social 
capital within the context of a research-based pathway program: increase student access to information and 
engagement with support and resources about health careers and the educational trajectory, and create a 
multi-level mentorship network composed of high school students, pre-med undergraduates, and medical 
students. To test our hypothesis, we will design and refine a modular curriculum to introduce high school and 
college students to medical education and provide them with knowledge and skills development essential for 
pursuing a career in health professions. The multi-institutional project team will implement a four-year 
medical pathway program for high school students in partnership with schools with racially diverse student 
populations and/or a high percentage of students living in low-income households. This project combines 
Social Capital Theory (SCT), an evidence-based mentorship structure, and best practices for designing and 
implementing pathway programs. At the project’s completion, the research education program will have 
supported 70 high school students, 10 undergraduate students, and 15 medical students to progress in their 
education and career goals. Expected outcomes are to spark and sustain high school and undergraduate 
students' interest in health careers; to increase participants’ application and acceptance into health-related 
programs; to increase medical students' professional self-efficacy; and to establish a sustainable mentoring 
network of high school, undergraduate, and medical students, and physicians. The scientific education research 
will be novel in applying SCT to help reduce systemic barriers to medical and health education. The project is 
scalable with the potential for local, regional, and national programs all of which, in the long term, will 
contribute to a more equitable society, where people of all backgrounds and identities have access to relevant 
and quality healthcare."
10890783,"Abstract
Claudication, the most common clinical presentation of patients with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD), is a
severe functional limitation of the lower extremities identified as walking-induced leg muscle pain relieved by
rest. Numerous studies have identified a lower-leg myopathy in these patients. There is general agreement
that the proximate cause of this myopathy is dysfunctional mitochondria which produce oxidative damage in
response to repeated episodes of walking-induced ischemia/hypoxia. These patients have few therapeutic
options including only two FDA approved medications, Pentoxifylline and Cilostazol, which are modestly
effective. A promising medication for treatment of claudicating PAD patients is MitoQ an antioxidant that
concentrates several hundred-fold in mitochondria. The significant contribution of mitochondrial oxidative
damage to a wide range of pathologic conditions has stimulated clinical studies which have found MitoQ to be
safe and effective. Our group has documented improved walking performance of claudicating PAD patients
receiving a single dose of MitoQ. We propose to study, for the first time, the effects of long-term MitoQ
treatment on the myopathy and functional performance of claudicating PAD patients. Our Hypothesis:
Treatment of claudicating PAD patients with MitoQ for six months improves 1) patient performance determined
as walking performance, daily physical activity, and quality of life, 2) calf muscle histopathology and
pathophysiology, and 3) the systemic physiological parameters pulmonary O2 uptake (VO2) and metabolic
profile. These changes correlate directly with reduced oxidative damage to calf muscle mitochondria, improved
mitophagy, and improved mitochondrial function. We will test this hypothesis by implementing the following
Specific Aims. Specific Aim ‘1’ will test the hypothesis that a six-month regimen of MitoQ improves
performance determined as walking performance, daily physical activity, and quality of life of claudicating PAD
patients, in association with improved calf muscle histopathology & pathophysiology, and improved VO2 &
systemic metabolic profile. Specific Aim ‘2’ will test the hypothesis that a six-month regimen of MitoQ reduces
mitochondrial oxidative damage, improves mitophagy, and improves mitochondrial function of the voluminous,
myofiber-mitochondrial compartment and that these improvements correlate with improved performance of
claudicating PAD patients, improved calf muscle histopathology & pathophysiology, and improved VO2 &
systemic metabolic profile. Specific Aim ‘3’ will test the hypothesis that a six-month regimen of MitoQ
improves endothelial function and lower extremity hemodynamics, calf muscle heme oxygenation, and
endothelium-dependent vasomotor function of micro-vessels isolated from the affected calf muscle of
claudicating PAD patients, in association with improved mitochondrial function of the micro-vessels.
 If our hypothesis is correct, the work will support a causal connection between mitochondrial oxidative
damage and PAD myopathy and patient performance; and identify MitoQ as a promising treatment for PAD."
10890784,"ABSTRACT
A recent global estimate suggests that nearly 250 million young children fail to reach their cognitive potential,
leading to widening gaps in health and human capital as these children become adults. Many children who fail
to meet their potential have suffered from major life events that lead to downward spirals in health, cognitive
development, and ultimately lower human capital accumulation. China’s major social, economic, and
demographic transitions have led to more than a third of all children and adolescents in rural China who are left
behind by one or both parents who migrate for job opportunities. Yet, there are fundamental gaps in
understanding: (1) the mechanisms through which such major life events affect health and development; and
(2) the moderating and mediating factors that may buffer these impacts on human capital. The China Health
and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) is an NIH-funded study of more than 41,000 individuals followed over 35 years,
capturing dramatic and rapid modernization- and environment-related changes in individual, household and
community environments. The CHNS offers high quality, unique and extraordinary, intergenerational data that
capture the interdependent biological, health, social, and environmental factors that affect child development
over time and under conditions of enormous environmental change (e.g., the end of the one-child policy,
migration of adults to seek work, leaving their children behind with grandparents, and closures of village
schools sending children away from their families to attend boarding schools). We propose data collection from
individuals aged 0-45 years in an additional round in 2021, preserving the continuity of CHNS, while adding
new measures of age-specific cognitive and non-cognitive skills, parental, school and community investments.
We propose data collection and dissemination of this ongoing and valuable public resource. These data will
provide the unique opportunity to understand complex biological, social, and environmental dynamics of
multiple dimensions of human capital in context of new social, economic and demographic shifts. We propose
to identify life-stage-specific exposures that predict cognitive function, school attainment, and height and test
hypotheses about how investments in health, nutrition, and education shape human capital and foster
resilience in the face of rapid changes. In addition, we propose to identify how changing dietary patterns,
including intakes of sodium, potassium, and “modern diets” relate to body mass, waist circumference, and
blood pressure from youth into adulthood (ages 0-45 years). Adding an 11th wave of multipurpose data will
augment the already high value and utility of the CHNS, by including an expanded focus on cognitive and non-
cognitive skills, parental, school and community investments, allowing for the study of the dynamics and early
life antecedents of human capital accumulation, with a focus on modifiable factors with potential to buffer
adverse life events and augment health and human capital. China is an ideal case study given its variation of
space and time, and a model for changes across the globe."
10888642,"Microglia and astrocytes are glial cell types in the brain that interact directly with neurons to maintain neural
tissue homeostasis. We are beginning to understand that glial cell dysfunctions contribute to the early damage
of neural circuits that manifests disease symptoms in many neurodegenerative disorders. Despite the
contributions of glia to CNS disorder progression, we currently have limited approaches to target these cells
preferentially for therapy. Viral vectors are used routinely in preclinical CNS models for cell specific targeting,
but there are limitations with these technologies including poor transduction efficiency in glia, low specificity,
immune activation, and off-target effects. The emergence of comprehensive glial cell specific transcriptomics
information has enabled the identification of unique molecular features on the surface of different glial cells that
can be used to develop innovative targeted non-viral drug delivery approaches. With the overall goal of
developing effective nanoparticle-based strategies to deliver therapies to specific glial cell types to correct
dysfunctions that cause CNS disease, this project’s main objectives are to: 1) optimize dendrimer
nanoparticles with multivalent functionalization of ligands for specific cell surface transporters that are uniquely
and highly expressed on microglia and astrocytes, and 2) test the glial cell specific delivery of mRNA afforded
by these nanoparticles when injected locally into different brain regions or neuroinflammatory states. Our
hypothesis is that intracerebral injection of nanoparticles with multivalent presentation of specific ligands will
enable preferential binding and subsequent uptake of nanoparticles into the glial cells that uniquely express the
transporter for that ligand, thereby enabling highly specific mRNA delivery. In the first aim, we will optimize
dendrimer nanoparticles with multivalent presentation of microglia and astrocyte targeting molecules and
ionizable tertiary amines for mRNA loading. Using an in silico unsupervised analysis of published glia
transcriptomes we have identified specific cell surface transporters that are uniquely and highly expressed on
microglia and astrocytes respectively that can be targeted with known ligands that we can readily conjugate to
dendrimer nanoparticles. We will use several in vitro screening assays to optimize dendrimers for mRNA
loading and delivery. In the second aim, we will test glial cell targeting of dendrimer nanoparticles in the mouse
brain under healthy and neuroinflammation states and use functional delivery of Cre recombinase mRNA in
Ai14 transgenic reporter mice to determine efficacy. Through this project, we will provide new insights into the
biology of transporters and their involvement in trafficking and uptake mechanisms in glia that can be used to
improve drug delivery outcomes. This work will also enable innovations in nanoparticle design for exogenous
targeting of therapies in the CNS that will have broad implications for treating neurological disease."

Excessive fear and avoidance is a hallmark of anxiety disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder and
special phobia. Social support is commonly used in anxiety-disorder therapies to facilitate extinction of fear or
avoidance. However, how neural activities inside the brain give rise to the social effects on extinction is unknown.
Here we propose to study the underlying neural circuits in rats performing a specially designed behavioral task,
called social extinction of conditioned place avoidance. In this task, a rat fear-conditioned to a shock-zone in an
open arena learns from a conspecific rat that the place is no longer aversive, leading to a reduction of avoidance
to the shock-zone. We will focus on the hippocampus (HP), given its key role in place coding and fear extinction,
and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), given its crucial role in social learning. By conducting high-density
tetrode recordings of HP and ACC neurons during this task, we will test a functional model that specifies how
these neurons computationally contribute to social extinction of place avoidance. We will focus on how the
hippocampal spatial representation of the shock-zone is activated by a social subject and how the ACC activities
responding to the aversive experience at the shock-zone are dynamically altered during the extinction. In
addition, we will determine a causal link between the HP and ACC neural activities and the social extinction
behavior by closed-loop electrical and optogenetic manipulations. The outcomes of this study will provide a
specific neural circuit mechanism for how social extinction is achieved inside the brain. The knowledge generated
in this study may inspire novel strategies for better social support or intervention in anxiety disorders."

In this R25 application, NYU Steinhardt faculty in rehabilitation health professions research (RHP, including
physical therapy, occupational therapy, communicative sciences and disorders, music therapy, drama therapy
and art therapy) and education research will partner with College and Career Lab (CCL) and create a research
pathway, CCL - IncreasinG RepresentatioN In RehabilItation and CreaTivE Health Professions Research, “CCL
IGNITE”. Guided by findings from contemporary educational research and substantial preliminary work, CCL-
IGNITE will deploy a robust, mentorship-based curriculum designed jointly by educators and researchers at CCL
and NYU Steinhardt. The central premise of CCL-IGNITE is that early access, increased resources and
sustained engagement will fulfill a critical need for early exposure to RHP research and RHP mentors, and
improve educational outcomes in students from groups that are underrepresented in RHP and biomedical
research.
There are three key novel aspects to CCL-IGNITE. First, we will increase access by designing unique culturally
relevant science education and research opportunities in RHP research, and offer increased resources
supporting academic and career preparation and offering financial support. Second, CCL-IGNITE will increase
engagement by implementing a thoughtful and robust approach to mentorship and the development of RHP
identities, one that is supported by our substantial preliminary work. Third, we include a rigorous impact
evaluation that overcomes the pitfalls of conventional program assessment.
Key outcomes of CCL-IGNITE include: 1) 150 high school students will participate in our summer research
pathways and subsequent academic-year practice labs (Immersive Stage). Additionally, 300 middle school
students will receive early exposure to RHP and RHP research (Exploratory Stage). 2) Novel RHP research-
related science education resources will be developed during the course of this project and disseminated through
CCL-IGNITE website and annual dissemination events (including an open house event for public school teachers
and a community lab for community based organizations serving low income historically underrepresented
middle and high school students in NYC). 3) Evaluation outcomes (short and medium term objective outcomes
to assess impact on grades, absenteeism, choice of courses, type of high school applied to; qualitative outcomes
for program refinement) will be disseminated in the peer-reviewed scientific literature in the form of manuscripts
and conference presentations, and will be used to motivate evidence-based practice.
This application has high potential for substantial positive impact as CCL-IGNITE will leverage university-
community partnerships in a highly diverse urban area and encourage youth from that are underrepresented in
the biomedical and behavioral sciences to pursue further studies and careers in RHP research, consistent with
PA-23-137."

Neither populations nor health outcomes are spread evenly across the natural environment. Due to historical
patterns of selective land settlement, natural resource extraction, forced migration, and land viability,
marginalized populations are more likely to live on land of poor quality. These patterns impact present-day
population health and health disparities through numerous mechanisms. A key underexplored mechanism linking
land quality to health equity is bedrock lithology—the chemical and physical properties of bedrock—which is
linked to population health through water quality. In this study, we will use an interdisciplinary approach to unravel
the relationship between bedrock lithology, settlement patterns, water quality, and health equity across the state
of Oklahoma. This study innovates by piloting a novel methodology for collecting data on water quality and
human health, while also showcasing a unique interdisciplinary link between geochemical and public health
research. We pursue our research relying upon a conceptual model developed for understanding the role of
bedrock in a socially unjust society and do so through three specific aims:
1) Model the relationship between bedrock lithology, land use, settlement, and the uneven distribution of
 health-related water quality issues in Oklahoma.
2) Collect primary geochemical data to understand the relationship between bedrock lithology and filtration
 of health-impacting pollutants.
3) Survey households throughout Oklahoma to understand how bedrock lithology is impacting drinking
 water quality and human health.
By employing a variety of techniques including secondary analysis of government data, primary geochemical
data collection, and a novel linked social science and household water survey, we will triangulate the relationship
between bedrock lithology, drinking water quality, and human health equity. These results will form the essential
building blocks of a larger proposal for independent R01 funding from the NIH in the future."

This proposal describes a five-year career development program designed to support an academic, physician-
scientist career. The proposed research project will capitalize on the expertise and resources available at
Washington University School of Medicine, which has a strong tradition of developing physician-scientists. Dr.
Timothy Ley, an expert in cancer genomics and epigenetics, and a recipient of multiple mentorship awards
nationally and at Washington University, will serve as the primary research mentor. The ultimate goal of the
candidate is to be an independent investigator in an academic medical center, studying epigenetic control of
cutaneous carcinogenesis, and caring for patients with cutaneous malignancies.
The long-term goal of this study is to define alterations in the epigenetic “state” of epidermal
keratinocytes that arise during normal aging and their roles in creating age-related susceptibilities for
skin cancer. Increasing age and UV light exposure are the two most prominent epidemiologic risk factors for
the development of skin cancer in fair skinned populations. Recent studies have identified clonal expansions of
cells harboring oncogenic mutations from clinically normal skin, suggesting that additional genetic or epigenetic
events are required for transformation to skin cancer. Aging and UV light exposure not only cause DNA
damage and mutations, but also have been demonstrated to cause DNA methylation changes in the skin of
human patients; whether these alterations are relevant for skin cancer pathogenesis is currently unknown. Our
preliminary data suggests that the DNA methylation state of epidermal cells undergoes a programmed change
at specific loci in mice as they age, as do stereotypical changes in gene expression resulting in the
development of a population of cells that we have named “basal aging-signature keratinocytes” (BASKs). We
will explore the hypothesis that age-related epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, may increase
susceptibility to skin cancer development with the following specific aims: Aim 1: We will define the epigenetic
events in murine epidermis that result from normal aging, relate them to functional changes, and assess their
roles in the development of skin cancers. We will define the epigenetic changes in BASK cells, define
biomarkers that allow for the purification of this population, and test the susceptibility of aged skin to KRASG12D-
mediated skin tumorigenesis and the development of UVB-induced, mutated Trp53 clonal islands in the skin.
Aim 2: We will define the roles of individual DNA methyltransferases for the development of age-dependent
methylation states and for the neoplastic transformation of skin. Using mice conditionally deficient in Dnmt1,
Dnmt3a, and/or Dnmt3b in epidermal cells, we will determine whether these enzymes contribute to age-related
development of the BASK phenotype, and whether their deficiencies are relevant for KRASG12D-mediated skin
tumorigenesis. If successful, insights gained from this work may allow for the creation of novel therapeutic or
preventative approaches for the keratinocyte cancers, basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma."
10871837,"A long-term goal of our research is to define the molecular mechanisms underpinning the initiation of
 cellular DNA replication. Initiation represents a central commitment to cell proliferation; inappropriate
 onset of replication can lead to genetic instabilities, DNA damage, and changes in gene copy number.
 From a biomedical perspective, initiation is a keystone pathway that should be susceptible to therapeutic
 intervention for controlling bacterial infections and cancers; however, a molecular-level understanding of
 initiation factors and their activities is insufficiently complete to advance such efforts.
The present renewal application focuses on the initiation of DNA replication in bacteria. Although a basic
biochemical framework for this process is in place, the mechanistic and regulatory principles by which
replication complexes are assembled remain highly enigmatic. In the past project period, we answered
long-standing questions about how the bacterial replicative helicase is physically loaded onto DNA and
how ATP turnover allosterically controls this process. We uncovered a new conformational switching
mechanism in the replicative helicase that controls the binding of primase, which synthesizes short RNAs
to jump-start DNA synthesis. We developed new insights into how hexameric helicases use ATP to drive
nucleic acid translocation and how small molecules and partner proteins can control these enzymes.
Our past progress paves the way for us to tackle exciting new problems involving initiation. Using
structural, biochemical, and single-molecule approaches, we will address fundamental questions
regarding the structural organization of early-stage replisome formation, the molecular means by which
initiation factors exchange partner proteins in an appropriate temporal order, and the ability of replicative
helicases to navigate duplex nucleic-acid roadblocks. The outcome of the proposed studies will be a
mechanistic picture of the major steps involved in converting a duplex chromosomal region into an
elongating replication fork. These findings will define new principles for the field of DNA replication and the
broader action of ATP-dependent machines and switches; it will also establish new insights and
approaches for advancing drug-discovery efforts that target bacterial initiation systems."
10871843,"Structural racism (SR) has been defined as the macro level systems, social forces, institutions, ideologies, and
processes that interact with one another to generate and reinforce inequities among racial/ethnic groups. The
mechanisms of SR are “unseen” and thus understudied and typically not incorporated into public health
interventions. For example, 2.5 million hired farmworkers in the U.S., who overwhelmingly are Black and/or
Latinx, live in economically segregated communities with substandard and crowded housing conditions, unsafe
or limited water that render COVID-19 preventive measures such hand hygiene and social distancing
challenging, if not impossible. Additionally, migrant and seasonal farmworkers (MSFWs) are among the lowest
paid, lack access to health information, preventive care and medical treatment. These patterns of vulnerability
reflect historical exclusion, motivated by anti-Black racism, of farmworkers from federally protected right to
organize and other labor protections, labor practices traced to the Jim Crow era, and an immigration and labor
policy environment in which MSFWs avoid reporting illness or seeking care for fear of retaliation from
employers. COVID-19 has only exacerbated these vulnerabilities; outbreaks of COVID-19 have been reported
among farmworkers and agricultural counties in the U.S. have seen disproportionately high rates of COVID-19.
Structures of marginalization of MSFWs are not widely considered through the lens of SR. To better protect the
health of Black and/or Latinx MSFWs and design an equitable response to the inevitable next pandemic,
research is needed to understand and dismantle the structural and institutional drivers of health inequities. Our
proposed work aims address this critical need through an innovative community-driven, multilevel and
multidisciplinary approach study to: examine the relationships between migrant labor housing policy regimes,
indoor air quality, exposure to viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) and respiratory health of MSFWs over time (Aim1);
characterize structural pathways through which COVID-19 policy and regulatory responses interact and
influence racialized health outcomes among MSFWs through a community-based system dynamics group
modeling approach (Aim2); and evaluate the influence of agricultural migrant employment, public health and
housing law and policy on COVID-19 epidemics across selected agricultural states using a quasi-experimental
study design (Aim 3). These aims address two NIH research priorities:1) understand the impact of SR on
minority health and health disparities and 2) inform health care and social policies at all levels on mitigating
SR’s impacts on the health of vulnerable populations. Results from our proposed study will inform the design of
policies and best practices to counter long-standing mechanisms of SR impacting MSFWs, optimize living and
working conditions for better health protections and to control future outbreaks of infectious disease among
these invisible and vulnerable workers."
10871844,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality nationwide. In patients with metastatic non-small
cell lung cancer, recent randomized trials have demonstrated superior efficacy of combined chemotherapy and
T cell checkpoint blockade over conventional treatment. These studies have made combination chemotherapy
and T cell checkpoint blockade the new standard of care for patients with lung cancer. However, the
mechanisms contributing to the combinatorial efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy remain unknown. Therefore,
drug combinations are determined based on historical regimens for lung cancer rather than scientific rationale.
Our laboratory has a strong interest in understanding the mechanisms underlying treatment responses as a
means of discovering new cancer treatments. The proposal described here builds on our previous work, which
identified a combination of targeted therapies that potently induces cellular senescence. In addition to
demonstrating durable growth arrest, these senescent cells secrete an array of cytokines that facilitate immune
surveillance and tumor cell clearance. Interestingly, our preliminary data suggest that a similar senescent state
can be induced by the standard chemotherapy for lung cancer. We hypothesize that this senescence may
contribute to the clinically observed combinatorial efficacy between chemotherapy and T cell checkpoint
blockade.
We propose to characterize chemotherapy-induced senescence, with a particular emphasis on secreted
immunomodulatory cytokines. We will leverage orthogonal in vitro and in vivo systems to explore the relevance
of senescence to adaptive immunosurveillance, with the goal of determining whether senescence indeed
contributes to cytotoxicity in the context of T cell checkpoint inhibition. In addition, we will interrogate tumor
specimens from patients treated with chemotherapy, immune checkpoint blockade, or the combination to
document the relevance of chemotherapy-induced senescence in patients with NSCLC. The data generated by
this proposal will have direct relevance to the current state of NSCLC treatment, and they will facilitate the
development of additional, potentially novel, drug combinations.
These studies will be led by Dr. Matthew Bott, a junior faculty member on the thoracic surgical service at
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) with an interest in lung cancer and immunotherapy. The
research will be carried out under the combined mentorship of Dr. Scott Lowe, an international leader in cancer

Debilitating hear loss affects over 6% of the world’s population and can result in a profound
decrease in the quality of life for those afflicted. Hearing is mediated by mechanosensory hair
cells located in the cochlea of the inner ear. Another population of hair cells in the inner ear
makes up the vestibular system to relay the sensation of balance and gravity. Hair cell damage
results in sensory defects. The causes of hair cell damage include age, noise exposure, ototoxic
drugs, disease, and injury. In adult mammals, once hair cells are lost, they do not regenerate,
resulting in permanent hearing loss and balance disorders.
In addition to mediating the sensations of hearing and balance, mechanosensory hair cells are
also required for close touch sensation in the lateral line systems of aquatic vertebrates. Lateral
line hair cells are morphologically and genetically very similar to inner ear hair cells. In contrast
to the inner ear hair cell of mammals, the hair cells of the lateral line system are robustly
regenerative. The zebrafish (Danio rerio), has emerged as a valuable model to study the
mechanisms of mechanosensory hair cell regeneration.
Research using pharmacological manipulation of the canonical Wnt pathway suggests that it is
critical for regulating the cellular proliferation and differentiation required for hair cell
regeneration. To genetically confirm a role for Wnt signaling during regeneration, we will use
three zebrafish lines carrying mutations at different points in the Wnt pathway. In Aim 1, we will
characterize hair cell regeneration in the krm1nl10 mutant, which results in overactivation of Wnt
signaling. In Aim 2, we will characterize regeneration in the lef1nl2 mutant line, which results in
an inhibition of Wnt activity. In Aim 3, we will examine regeneration in a third line, foxg1aa266,
which contains a mutation in the Wnt transcriptional target gene foxg1a. Together, we will use
these lines to determine how cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival are regulated by
the Wnt pathway during regeneration of mechanosensory hair cells. The long-term goal of this
work is to provide a mechanism for regenerate hair cells in the human inner ear."
10871884,"MDM2 and XIAP are important cell-survival proteins in tumor cells. MDM2 acts as an oncoprotein, promoting
cancer progression mainly through inhibition of the tumor suppressor p53, while the anti-apoptotic protein XIAP
plays a critical role in development of resistance to treatment via inhibition of therapy-induced apoptosis. MDM2
overexpression and upregulated XIAP have been detected in various human cancers but not in normal
cells/tissues, and elevated MDM2 and XIAP expression in tumor cells is associated with disease progression
and poor treatment outcomes.
 Our previous studies elucidated a molecular mechanism by which the MDM2 C-terminal RING domain
interacts with XIAP IRES mRNA resulting in stabilization of MDM2 protein and enhanced translation of XIAP;
this led to concomitantly increased expression of both MDM2 and XIAP, contributing to cancer progression and
drug resistance. We have recently established a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay for use in high-throughput
screening (HTS) of chemical libraries and identified a compound (MX69) that binds to the MDM2 RING domain
and blocks or disrupts its interaction with XIAP IRES mRNA. Blocking this interaction results in simultaneous
inhibition of both MDM2 and XIAP, leading to cancer cell apoptosis and death. The overall goal of this proposal
is to develop a potential novel targeted agent based on the MX69 scaffold against tumors overexpressing MDM2.
As discussed above, these tumors also typically upregulate XIAP in an MDM2-dependent manner, resulting in
enhanced drug resistance.
 Specifically, we will perform computer-aided drug design based on the MX69 structure and iteratively
optimize MDM2 binding and anticancer activity (Aim 1). We will define the molecular and biological
mechanism(s) of action of novel MX69 analogs by solving the X-ray crystal structures of MDM2 in complex with
diverse MX69 analogs to confirm on-target MDM2/XIAP inhibition and to evaluate any potential nonspecific
effects (Aim 2). We will perform preclinical studies to assess compound stability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and
pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of the best MX69 analogs; to evaluate their anticancer activity in vivo using
human cancer-in-mouse models; and to determine any potential toxicity to normal cells/tissues (Aim 3). Upon
completion of this project, we will have determined the feasibility of dual targeting MDM2/XIAP as a novel
therapeutic mechanism, and will have developed promising small molecule inhibitors for further preclinical
evaluations, not only for leukemia and neuroblastoma as studied in this proposal, but also in other cancer types."
10871885,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The 20 years since publication of the draft human genome sequence in 2001 have been a truly transformational
era in the field of cancer research marked by ever more significant scientific milestones and a steadily
accelerating rate of progress. Global scientific initiatives focused on comprehensive characterization of tumor
genomes – such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes
(PCAWG) – are radically transforming our approach to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer.
Surprisingly, although both TCGA and PCAWG included tumors from patients on many continents, few tumors
from Africa were included in their analyses. Moreover, the number of African scientists involved in the two
projects was limited. The paucity of African tumors analyzed by TCGA and PCAWG, and the dearth of African
scientists involved in their analysis, is concerning given that Africa is home to 1.4 of the world’s 7.9 billion
inhabitants, and much of human genetic variation is found only on the African continent. The profound under-
representation of African genomes and tumors – and of African scientists – in cancer genomics studies is
attributable to many factors, but the lack of requisite infrastructure for genomic research in Africa and the limited
number of genomics professionals in Africa who are trained in both the generation and analysis of genomic data
are major contributors. To ensure that the transformative benefits of recent advances in cancer genomics to the
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer will be realized in Africa, dedicated initiatives must be undertaken
to increase the number of trained genomics professionals in Africa. In this application, the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA and the Uganda Cancer Institute in Kampala, Uganda – two premier
institutions that have been collaborating since 2004 to conduct cancer research and to increase the capacity for
high-quality cancer research, training, and clinical care in Uganda and East Africa – propose to extend their well-
established collaboration to address the critical shortage of African genomics professionals who are trained in
the generation and the analysis of cancer genomic data. We hypothesize that improving the supply of African
professionals who can both generate cancer genomic data of reproducibly high quality and analyze those data
rigorously and comprehensively will accelerate the development of an Africa-based cancer genomics community
and ensure that the advances of the cancer genomics revolution will maximally benefit African cancer patients.
Over a period of 5 years, and in conjunction with the Infectious Diseases Institute of the College of Health
Sciences, Makerere University, the Fred Hutch and UCI will support 4 Ugandan or East African individuals who
will complete master’s degrees, and 2 who will complete doctoral degrees, in Bioinformatics with a focus on
cancer genomics and genomic data science. We anticipate that graduates of the program will become the
leaders of the cancer genomics community in Uganda and East Africa."

The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of the genetic etiology of Alzheimer disease
(AD) risk in understudied and underserved populations. AD is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly
and occurs in all ethnic and racial groups, but most genetic studies for AD have been performed in non-Hispanic
Whites (NHW) of European ancestry. This is problematic, as much smaller studies in African Americans (AA),
who have a higher prevalence of AD compared to NHW, have already revealed differences in risk effect sizes in
known loci (e.g., APOE; ABCA7), indicating multiple unique patterns of risk. Genetic ancestry (including
variability in allele risk frequencies and population specific variants modifying known and novel risk loci), in
addition to environmental/cultural factors and their interactions with genetic risk, likely underlies part of this
heterogeneity. With only a small number of the whole genome sequences in the Alzheimer’s Disease
Sequencing Project (ADSP) coming from AA, increased sample sizes and multiple study designs are needed to
elucidate risk in diverse ancestral populations. Family studies provide a powerful complementary design to case-
control studies that can enhance risk prediction and the detection of novel rare risk variants. Filling these critical
gaps using genetic tools will enhance our understanding of AD risk and provide the basis for identifying
prevention strategies and druggable targets. Including ancestral populations from Africa in particular a unique
cohort of multiplex African AD families enables dissecting risk not only in African populations but also among all
populations with AF ancestry. Our efforts will allow for improved disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis, and
treatment through precision medicine, in AA, African, and other African admixed populations."

10873143,"DNA TO PROTEINS: GENE REGULATION, PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND FUNCTION IN EPILEPSY
 Loss of function (LOF) mutations in hundreds of genes are associated with human epilepsy. However,
the high frequency of sequence variation among individuals presents a challenge to ascribe missense variants
as causing epilepsy. This highly multidisciplinary research team develops a modular platform approach to
accelerate determination of the functional, pharmacological, neuronal network and whole animal consequences
of genetic variants of uncertain significance (VUS) encountered in patients with a range of epilepsy types. The
ultimate goal is to devise strategies for establishing genetic diagnostic criteria and identifying potential targets
for intervention. To this end, Project 1 will join Project 2 investigators in the interrogation of multiple VUS in 1 to
2 frequently encountered, non-ion channel encoding epilepsy genes per year (up to 10 genes in 5 years). Project
1 employs moderate-throughput assessment of 12-15 VUSs per gene, examined in 3 Milestones:
 Milestone 1 will assess in silico and in vitro model systems for VUS functional analyses to: 1a.
with the gene and variant curation core (GVCC), generate and assess In silico tools to improve modeling of VUS
pathogenicity; 1b. use 2-dimentional (2-D) cultures of HEK293T cells in biochemical tests of each studied VUS
to examine mutant protein stability, known protein interactions and aggregation; 1c. test the impact of a
VUS on subcellular localization, protein trafficking and/or post translational processing.
 Milestone 2 will establish assays of cell autonomous effects in vitro. The human epilepsy tool core
(HETC) will inactivate selected genes and generate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) that express dox-
induced Neurogenin 2 (iNeurons) or ASCL1 & DLX2 (iGNs) for direct induction of neurons. Knockout neurons
will be made to overexpress WT or VUS containing protein and their ability to rescue LOF phenotypes in knockout
cells will be examined in 2-D cultures through assessing progenitor proliferation, cell survival, potential for
differentiation and gene expression using cell morphology, motility, and RNAseq.
 Milestone 3. Functional impact of VUS on synapse formation and network properties. These
iNeurons (e.g. expressing WT or VUS-containing STXBP1) will be examined for synapse formation, turnover
(plasticity), transport, and firing properties using multi-electrode arrays (MEA). These 2-D cultures will
screen cells differentiated toward either glutamatergic excitatory or GABAergic inhibitory phenotypes, picking
the most promising lines in Project 1 that Project 2 will use in cell systems of mixed cell types in 2-D and 3-D.
As a whole, this U54 delivers: 1) multiple optimized, cross-validated hPSC platforms to interrogate epilepsy
genes; 2) in vitro and in vivo determination of human VUS pathogenicity for up to 10 non-ion channel epilepsy
genes; 3) optimized models for each epilepsy gene; and 4) platforms for future precision therapeutic testing.!"
10873144,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 2
Next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) has led to the rapid discovery of large numbers of epilepsy genes, and
the list of epilepsy genes has grown well beyond ion channels to those that affect a wide array of cellular
functions. Our understanding of how any specific gene mutation leads to epilepsy, however, increasingly lags
behind gene discovery. Moreover, NGS has led to increased numbers of genetic variants of uncertain
significance (VUS) that are difficult to interpret diagnostically. We lack the tools to assay VUS effects or effectively
study pathogenic mechanisms for these epilepsy genes. To address these shortfalls, the EpiMVP will optimize
cutting-edge multiplatform assays for epilepsy genes that include cell lines (Project 1), human pluripotent stem
cells (hPSCs; Projects 1 and 2), human cortical organoids (hCOs; Project 2), and in vivo rodent and zebrafish
models (Project 3). The Gene and Variant Curation Core (GVCC) will interact with the projects to select and
refine specific genes and variants for testing as the VUS list is streamlined from Projects 1 to 2 to 3. Key to this
effort is the Human Epilepsy Tools Core (HETC) which will provide cell lines (for Projects 1 and 2) and variant
expression vectors (for all 3 projects). The long-term goal of our work is to deliver an in vitro testing pipeline in
human neuronal models to assay clinically relevant VUS for all non-ion channel epilepsy genes. We have
identified relevant morphological/functional 2-D or hCO phenotypes for 6 genes in the top 10 most commonly
diagnosed non-ion channel genetic epilepsies, as well as reagents for several others, using: 1) 2-D hPSC
cultures, including small molecule differentiation into excitatory or inhibitory cortical neurons, excitatory induced
neurons and induced GABA neurons (iNeurons/iGNs) generated by transcription factor expression, and mixed
cultures (iNeurons, iGNs and glia); and 2) 3-D hCO cultures, including multi-rosette, single rosette, excitatory,
inhibitory and fusion hCOs. We will use these assays to test the hypothesis that our platforms will predict VUS
pathogenicity and effectively prioritize variants for in vivo testing in Project 3. Our immediate goals are to
optimize assays for 1-2 genes per year, determine VUS pathogenicity in vitro for these genes and, in concert
with the VGCC, refine the VUS list for further in vivo testing in Project 3. The goals will be accomplished using
2-D hPSCs for Milestone 1 and 3-D hCOs in Milestone 2, and will include structural and functional assays for
each model system. These studies will provide the following deliverables: 1) multiple optimized, cross-validated
(between Parent and Ross labs) hPSC platforms to interrogate epilepsy genes; 2) determination of in vitro human
neuronal VUS pathogenicity for at least 5 non-ion channel epilepsy genes; 3) human neuronal models for each
epilepsy gene; and 4) optimized platforms for future mechanistic and precision therapeutic studies."
10873147,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Knowledge of epilepsy genes has exploded with the advent of next generation DNA sequencing (NGS), yet
our understanding of how any specific gene mutation leads to epilepsy increasingly lags behind gene
discovery. With the expanding list of potential epilepsy genes comes the problem of genetic variants of
uncertain significance (VUS), confounding definitive diagnosis, genetic counselling and treatment strategies.
The ultimate goal of the EpiMVP team is to develop a highly integrated and effective multiplatform pipeline
to determine the functional impact of VUS for non-ion channel epilepsy genes. To this end, the Gene and
Variant Curation Core (GVCC) provides in silico prediction of VUSs to prioritize and refine specific genes
and VUS for study as Project 1 (Genes to Proteins) begins in vitro biochemical and cell biological
assessment and Project 2 (Proteins to Cell Systems) further explores the prioritized VUS in two
dimensional (2-D) and 3-D cell systems. However, due to the complex nature of epilepsy and the brain,
uncertainty and even conflicting interpretation will at times arise from in vitro biochemical and cell-based
functional assays. Thus, it is ultimately critical to apply refined VUS list for in vivo functional assessment in
model organisms. The long-term goal of project 3 (Cell Systems to Preclinical Models) is to incorporate
in vivo functional assays into EpiMVP pipeline in which the functional and genetic data of a specific VUS are
merged to arrive at a decisive probability of pathogenicity. Project 3 will take advantage of Clustered
Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) gene editing methods to generate well-defined
loss-of-function (LOF) epilepsy models in rodent and zebrafish as a null background on which to evaluate
human VUS. Data generated in Project 3 will be shared with Projects 1 and 2 and the GVCC in an iterative
fashion with an overall deliverable to develop EpiPred (Epilepsy Variant Prediction), a machine learning
model that will allow accurate classification of missense epilepsy gene variants as likely pathogenic or
benign. With the prioritized and refined VUS list, we will test 3-4 VUS each for 1-2 genes per year and
complete testing of at least 5 genes in both fish and rodent model systems. Our first-year goal is to examine
functional rescue of 3-4 VUS each for STXBP1 and DEPDC5. Deliverables include: 1) Cross-validated in
vivo models to interrogate epilepsy genes; 2) Determination of VUS pathogenicity for at least 5 non-ion
channel epilepsy genes using 2 in vivo models; 3) Assessment of in silico and in vitro models for VUS
pathogenicity prediction, and whether in vivo models are required for certain genes and VUS; and 4)
Optimized in vivo models for each epilepsy gene that will be powerful platforms for future drug discovery and
for exploring underlying mechanisms in these genetic epilepsies."

The Gene and Variant Curation Core (GVCC) is a multi-institutional core that will be the central hub for
decision making for the genes and variants for study by the Epilepsy Multiplatform Variant Prediction (EpiMVP)
projects in this Center Without Walls (CWOW). The core will integrate genetic sequence data from population
and patient cohorts, as well as the functional readouts from the EpiMVP projects to develop EpiPred. EpiPred
will be an epilepsy-specific computational model that will predict the likelihood of a variant being pathogenic or
benign. The core capitalizes on the broad and multifaceted expertise of investigators at five major universities
including Northwestern University, Weill Cornell Medical College, University of Michigan, University of
California San Francisco and University of Washington. The broad objective of the core is to firstly curate and
select genes and variants for study in projects 1-3 of the EpiMVP. This data will be collated from large
population databases and patient datasets from our industry partners in the clinical genetic testing industry as
well as ClinVar and large consortia sequencing projects. Secondly the GVCC will use prediction tools, protein
structural modeling and functional data from projects 1-3 to create and optimize EpiPred, an epilepsy-specific
computational model that will predict the likelihood of a variant being pathogenic or benign. Finally, the GVCC
will support data management and web-based resources needed for seamless data sharing and
implementation of EpiPred in the epilepsy community. The GVCC will work with ClinGen curators and our
industry partners to test EpiPred accuracy on variants that are curated independently by the Epilepsy Working
Group, allowing refinement of both the algorithm and the criteria used by ClinGen for curation. Eventually, we
aim to incorporate the EpiMVP prediction algorithms into ClinGen curation practices, and ultimately the ACMG
criteria as well. Moreover, to expand the accessibility of EpiPred for patients, families, healthcare providers and
researchers we will establish a web-based version of EpiPred."

Acute trauma, defined by the DSM-5 criterion A for the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as
exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury or sexual violence, is associated with an increase in the
development of both Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and PTSD. It is well established that patients with PTSD
have a markedly increased risk for AUD. Furthermore, understanding risk for AUD during development,
particularly in adolescents is critical, as early onset drinking is one of the highest risk factors for lifetime alcohol
addiction. This current proposal seeks to further explore the relationship of AUD and PTSD in adolescents
exposed to acute trauma by focusing on biological predictors of AUD and/or PTSD development. In brief, 500
adolescents will be studied in the immediate aftermath of trauma in emergency departments, hospital clinics or
psychiatric settings in Austin, Texas (Dell Children’s Medical Center) and Galveston, Texas (University of
Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) affiliated hospitals). Using emerging statistical techniques and machine
learning-based analytics, we will identify predictive: 1. Genomic and epigenomic, 2. Inflammatory, and 3.
Psychophysiological biomarkers of risk for AUD and PTSD. Although several risk factors have been identified
in adults for the development of these two disorders, relatively little data is available in adolescents. Family and
twin studies have provided estimates of genetic risk for AUD and PTSD of 50% and 30-40%, respectively. We
will utilize the latest AUD and PTSD polygenic risk factor scores for these disorders, together with epigenomic
analysis. Previous work has implicated alterations in inflammatory response in both AUD and PTSD and we
will assess this in the immediate aftermath of the trauma. Finally, measures of autonomic nervous system
(including skin conductance response [SCR], heart rate and heart rate variability [HRV] via electrocardiography
[ECG]) and central nervous system (acoustic startle response assessed via electromyography [EMG])
reactivity will be assessed immediately after post-trauma medical clearance. Using state of the art statistical
modeling, we will identify biological predictors of AUD and PTSD and their interrelationship. These data will be
used to develop novel tools to predict which adolescents exposed to trauma will likely develop AUD and/or
PTSD, allowing for early intervention at this critical time in development."
10873299,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The federal eviction moratorium and local eviction moratoria that were implemented during the COVID-19
pandemic presents a unique opportunity to study the impact of eviction-related policies on healthcare use and
costs. The long-term goal is to bridge the knowledge and investments of the housing and healthcare fields to
address evictions as a social determinant of health that affects disparities in health and healthcare services.
The central hypothesis is that eviction moratoria policies can reduce use of homeless and acute care services
and tenant-landlord relationships are important to sustain housing stability. The rationale for this project is to
guide future development of policies and practices related to evictions with data from the healthcare sector to
prevent homelessness and acute care use. Guided by preliminary work, this project has three specific aims: 1)
Assess the impact of the federal eviction moratorium and local eviction moratoria on rates of eviction and use
of homeless programs; 2) Evaluate the impact of eviction moratoria on use of acute healthcare services and
cost; and 3) Examine relationships between tenants and landlords in urban and rural areas during the federal
eviction moratorium. To achieve these three aims, data on over 10 million patients from 2018-2023 served by
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system- the largest integrated system in the U.S. with
a comprehensive electronic medical record system- will be analyzed. For the first aim, an innovative natural
language processing system will be deployed to identify eviction cases in the medical record and to test
hypotheses that the federal and local eviction moratoria reduced rates of evictions and use of homeless
programs. For the second aim, impact analyses will be conducted to test the central hypothesis that the federal
and local eviction moratoria reduced use of acute care services and costs. Within the context of these first two
aims, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics predictive of eviction risk, homeless program use, and
acute care use will be identified to inform targeted prevention initiatives. For the third aim, qualitative interviews
will be conducted with 50 dyads of tenants and their landlords in Texas and New York about their experiences
with the federal eviction moratorium and the role of tenant-landlord relationships in the eviction process, which
will shed light on ways that tenants and landlords can be incentivized and considered important partners in
eviction prevention and policies. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it uses new
data science methods applied to the largest U.S. healthcare system to understand a unique set of policies
around evictions, all of which can contribute to needed knowledge in this area. The proposed research is
significant because it will help address evictions as an important public health problem associated with housing
and health disparities with implications for the healthcare field. Ultimately, the project has the potential to
advance the fields of housing and healthcare to better serve diverse and vulnerable populations."

Sleep is a very well conserved behavioral state across all animals. Though the exact function of sleep remains unknown, it
is widely appreciated that good sleep quality is a cornerstone for any healthy organism. Indeed, several neurological
disorders are co-morbid with sleep disturbances. Furthermore, altered sleep as observed in sleep apnea, insomnia or sleep
deprivation show impairments in memory consolidation and increased risk for depression, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), and other neuropsychiatric disorders. AD patients have been shown to display altered sleep architecture. Sleep plays
a role in clearance of beta-amyloid (Aβ) in interstitial space. Excessive accumulation of Aβ, a prominent feature of AD, has
been shown to alter sleep. Recent work in our lab has demonstrated that hyperexcitability of wake-promoting hypocretin
(Hcrt) neurons of the lateral hypothalamus (LH), resulting from natural aging, may underlie increased sleep fragmentation
during aging. It is likely that these same neurons may have altered excitability in AD, exacerbated by the presence of Aβ
accumulation, and may drive sleep fragmentation and sleep disturbances observed in AD patients. The overarching aim of
this proposal is to understand how Aβ accumulation impacts hypocretin neuron activity leading to altered homeostatic sleep
pressure and subsequent disrupted sleep architecture observed in Alzheimer’s disease. The central hypothesis is that
accumulation of Aβ accelerates natural Hcrt neuron death leading to hyperexcitability of surviving Hcrt neurons and
disrupted sleep pressure and architecture. This proposal focuses on Hcrt neurons as they have been suggested to be an
integration hub which consolidates several streams of input and sends signals to downstream arousal-promoting regions. To
understand this interaction, I will first need to demonstrate altered Hcrt neuron activity in the presence of Aβ accumulation,
its impact on sleep (Aim 1), and demonstrate changes to the intrinsic and synaptic excitability of Hcrt neurons (Aim 2).
Finally, I will consolidate the findings into a biophysically realistic computational network model with sleep-wake
transitions to make viable predictions about the relative contributions of various ionic / synaptic currents to changes in
intrinsic Hcrt neuron activity and its impact on overall sleep structure. These predictions will then be experimentally tested
using CRISPR-SaCas9 technologies in vivo, the results of which will then further inform/refine the computational model
(Aim 3). The end goal being a detailed theory / biophysical explanation for the impact of Aβ accumulation on Hcrt neuron
activity and their role in sleep architecture."

Telepsychology (“telepsych”) provides a unique opportunity to use behavioral economics (BE) strategies to
structure the therapy encounter in ways that nudge clinicians to deliver high-quality services. BE strategies are
best suited for changing discrete provider behaviors that are observable and measurable. This R34 aims to
develop and evaluate “Tele-BE,” a novel telehealth infrastructure that nudges and incentivizes clinicians to use
core structural components of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a leading psychosocial treatment with
demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness for a range of mental health concerns. Across protocols, CBT contains
many discrete components; however, nearly all CBT protocols include the following elements: (1) patient
symptom tracking, (2) collaborative agenda setting at the session start, (3) out-of-session practice (“homework”)
review, (4) skill instruction, (5) skill practice, and (6) homework planning. These CBT structural components
are likely to be responsive to BE strategies. Structural components also represent a core and distinct CBT
competency and serve as the foundation upon which specific intervention techniques are delivered; as such,
they are common to other evidence-based psychosocial practices beyond CBT as well. However, our prior work
illustrates that community clinicians have consistently low fidelity to these components. Aim 1 will use
participatory design to refine our Tele-BE prototype in collaboration with clinicians and supervisors (our target
end-users). In Aim 2, we will work closely with our web development team to field test and iteratively refine Tele-
BE using rapid cycle prototyping to optimize the user experience and refine our specific BE strategies. Aim 3
will test the preliminary effectiveness of the refined Tele-BE to engage our target mechanisms and enhance
clinician CBT structural component fidelity in a 12-week open trial with 30 community mental health clinicians
randomized to Tele-BE or telehealth as usual (Tele-AU). The trial will include 2 patients per clinician (60 patients
in total). All sessions will be recorded and coded for CBT fidelity. Clinicians and patients will complete
questionnaires at Weeks 1, 5, 9, and 12 and qualitative interviews at post. Aim 3 primary outcomes will be CBT
structural component fidelity, measured through coding of recorded sessions. Secondary outcomes include
target implementation mechanisms (intentions and their determinants: attitudes, norms and self-efficacy),
measured via mixed methods, and overall CBT fidelity. Using data from the open trial, Aim 4 will examine
acceptability and feasibility of Tele-BE from patient and clinician perspectives, as well as potential ethical issues
with Tele-BE. This R34 aligns with NIMH Strategic Plan Strategy 4.2.C to develop decision-support tools and
technologies that increase the implementation of mental health EBPs. Results will lead to a hybrid effectiveness-
implementation R01 to test strategies for optimizing Tele-BE's effect on clinician fidelity to improve patient
outcomes."

There is a growing trend in the use of vaping devices used to administer liquid concentrates containing Δ9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). However, there is a gap in our knowledge and understanding of the
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of THC delivered from this new generation of cannabis
products. The literature on nicotine vaping has clearly shown that vaping product characteristics and user
behaviors influence the PK/PD of vaped substances. Additionally, most cannabis consumers who vape liquid
cannabis concentrates also report concurrent use of nicotine-containing vaping products (e-cigarettes). Building
on strategies used to establish the evidence base on the PK/PD of nicotine-containing vaping products, this
project will examine the PK/PD profile of THC-containing liquid concentrates delivered through vaping
devices WITH and WITHOUT co-use of nicotine through completion of three specific aims: Aim 1 is to examine
how vaping product characteristics and user behaviors impact the PK/PD of THC. Aim 1 will characterize the
PK/PD variability in real-world settings. This will be achieved by using a mobile laboratory bus to recruit current
vapers of THC-containing liquids and examine their PK/PD. Study participants will use their own commercially
obtained THC cartridges ad lib through their usual vaping device. In Aim 2, a controlled laboratory paradigm will
be used to compare the PK/PD profiles of equivalent standard THC units delivered from vaping liquids vs smoked
cannabis. Aim 3 will assess the PK/PD profiles of THC vaping liquids sequentially administered with nicotine
using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized within-subjects trial design. This highly innovative
approach will offer a significant advantage over the existing literature by combining naturalistic observational
methods and controlled laboratory assessments to provide a depiction of the PK/PD of THC delivered through
vaping liquids. The findings will be directly relevant for the existing cannabis market and consumers who use
these products. This project will improve our understanding of the PK/PD effects of THC by characterizing the
PK/PD profiles of THC vaping liquid formulations and devices used by cannabis consumers, establishing
differences in the effects of these products relative to smoked cannabis, and providing necessary data on how
co-use of vaped nicotine and THC may impact THC PK/PD. Data from this project will be highly relevant for
informing future regulatory and consumer safety efforts for THC vaping products."

The N7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap is a unique molecular identifier that is a focal point for post-transcriptional
gene regulatory pathways. The m7G cap serves as both a roadblock to enzymes that would degrade the mRNA
and a landing pad for cap binding proteins that coordinate the pre-mRNA processing, nuclear export, and
translation initiation of most mRNAs. Until recently, capping was thought to be exclusively nuclear, and
decapping was thought to irreversibly destine the RNA to degradation. Simply stated, cytoplasmic capping is
the process by which an m7G cap is returned to an uncapped mRNA in the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic capping
requires NCK1 to coordinate the sequential actions of an unknown kinase, the capping enzyme, and an RNA
methyltransferase, which phosphorylate and cap the targeted mRNA and methylate the newly-added cap
respectively. Although we have learned much about the biochemistry of cytoplasmic capping, many fundamental
questions remain unanswered. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that: (1) Specific RNA sequence
elements (or modifications) recruit and/or trigger cytoplasmic capping activity and that (2) the cytoplasmic
capping of 5’-truncated mRNAs serves as a new tier of post-transcriptional gene regulation. This study will seek
answers to three key questions. First, a combination of data mining and new sequencing experiments will
uncover the sequences that target an mRNA to the cytoplasmic capping machinery. A bioinformatics approach
integrating published data sets marking cap positions and transcription start sites (TSS) will identify non-TSS-
associated caps. Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing will then compare RNA harvested from cells +/-
dominant negative cytoplasmic capping components to map full-length mRNA sequences. The synthesis of
these studies should ascertain the 5’ ends, the alternative splicing patterns, and polyadenylation site choices of
cytoplasmically capped mRNAs. Second, CRISPR knockouts of mRNA decapping enzymes (Dcp2, DcpS, etc)
and candidate endonucleases will identify the cellular mechanism(s) that generate uncapped ends for the
cytoplasmic capping machinery. These knockouts will be paired with focused and transcriptome-wide methods
to validate changes in cytoplasmic capping. Third, a combination of in vivo RNA labeling experiments and
ribosome profiling will establish how cytoplasmic capping surveys mRNAs during the onset of the stress
response. The generation, cytoplasmic capping, and translation of 5’-truncated mRNAs into N-terminally-
shortened proteins would effectively be a new tier of post-transcriptional gene regulation with far-reaching
impacts on the function(s) of the N-terminally truncated proteins. To summarize, this work will (1) identify and
validate the sequences that regulate cytoplasmic capping (2) determine the mechanism(s) by which RNA
substrates are generated for cytoplasmic capping, and (3) understand the in vivo function(s) of cytoplasmic
capping during the onset of acute stress responses."

While many consequences of college risky drinking affect the students themselves (e.g., hangovers,
embarrassment, academics), other problems such as impaired driving (IMPD) jeopardize public safety
and must be addressed. Reports show: 1) college student “high-intensity” drinkers (10+ drinks per
occasion) experience more problems, including increased impaired driving, and 2) although over 1.3
million drivers in the U.S. are arrested for impaired driving annually, they only represent 1% of the
estimated 121 million self-reported episodes of impaired driving each year. Our recent NIAAA-funded
research identified specific parenting behaviors related to college students’ risky drinking and
consequences that are not being adequately addressed in college-level parent interventions. This
research revealed: 1) many parents allow their teens to drink alcohol in an attempt to take the mystery
away and provide opportunities to teach them safer drinking practices; 2) parental permissiveness
toward underage drinking, even though it was intended to be protective by parents, had the opposite
effect and was significantly associated with increased drinking and consequences throughout college;
and 3) the effects of parental permissiveness was not attenuated by other positive parenting behaviors
(e.g., communication, monitoring). In response, we developed and piloted a brief 15-20 minute
intervention (P-Chat) that uses principles of Motivational Interviewing to reduce defensiveness and
change parents’ permissiveness. The pilot data demonstrate our ability to implement the P-Chat with
fidelity; modify parents’ willingness to change; and most importantly, change parents’ permissive
behaviors. These data provide justification to warrant a larger-scale comprehensive study examining the
effects of the P-Chat on reducing students’ risky drinking and consequences. Our proposed study will
use an extremely rigorous design to test the P-Chat. The aims are as follows: Aim 1: Assess the effects
of the P-Chat at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-baseline relative to a rigorous active comparison condition
(the original evidence-based PBI), an assessment only-control, and a combined intervention condition
the P-Chat plus the PBI (P-Chat+); Aim 2: Examine the process by which the P-Chat influences parents’
permissiveness (and communications) and college students’ behaviors (e.g., motives, expectancies,
norms, and willingness to consume alcohol) using a well-developed theoretical model; and Aim 3:
Examine subgroups for which the P-Chat is more effective versus less effective. Our moderators will be
broadly based and focus on baseline student characteristics (e.g., sex, age of onset of alcohol use) and
parent characteristics (e.g., sex, age, education, marital status, monitoring). To the extent that the
research is successful, it will provide an efficacious approach to address an important public health
problem."

Overview. This K24 mid-career investigator award will support Dr. Mark Siedner to lead a mentoring program
in patient-oriented research on detection and prevention of cardiovascular disease among people with HIV in
sub-Saharan Africa.
Candidate. Dr. Siedner is a physician scientist who serves as principal investigator (PI) or co-PI of four NIH
R01-funded patient-oriented research (POR) projects on HIV and/or cardiovascular disease in sub-Saharan
Africa, leading to over 220 peer-reviewed publications. He has also proven himself to be a highly successful
mentor, with over two dozen past and current trainees, receipt of the Harvard Medical School Young Mentor
Award, and evidenced by his role as co-director of an NIH T32 program in HIV clinical research at MGH (T32
AI007433), site PI of a global D43 clinical research training program on multimorbidity in Uganda (D43
TW011632), and program mentor in the Fogarty Clinical Research Fellowship (D43 T010543).
Mentoring plan. This K24 award will allow Dr. Siedner to protect 25% of his time to be dedicated for training
junior investigators in the US and sub-Saharan Africa in POR related to cardiovascular disease prevention
among people with HIV. He will leverage an established pipeline of clinical research trainees identified through
his leadership role on training grants and formalize a global cardiovascular disease research training program
that focuses on career advancement and pairs US and African scientists with collaborative projects.
Research Plan. Dr. Siedner will use the support provided by this award to pursue mid-career training in
machine learning and clinical risk prediction. He will leverage the machine learning training and partnerships
with experts in data science to comprehensively assess and validate individual and combinations of diagnostic
screening modalities for cardiovascular disease among people with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa (Aims 1 and 2).
This will be made possible with data from an NHLBI-funded R01 that includes CT angiography and extensive
risk factor data in 600 individuals in Uganda. In a second project, he will use risk prediction techniques to
derive and validate cardiovascular disease risk prediction scores among people with HIV in South Africa (Aim
3). This will be made possible by a Wellcome Trust-funded, population-based, longitudinal cohort study of over
18,000 people in South Africa who completed cardiovascular disease screening and are followed until
hospitalization and death. The proposed work is directly in line with research priorities outlined in NIH NOT-
020-013 including prevention of HIV co-morbid conditions across the lifespan and research training of a
multidisciplinary workforce. Moreover, Dr. Siedner’s longstanding commitment to training junior scientists in
POR, and particularly his dedication to the advancement of careers of women and individuals under-
represented in science, make him an excellent candidate for this award."
10865455,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the United States, 6.5 million people have heart failure (HF), the vast majority of whom are enrolled in
Medicare. Unfortunately, HF mortality is rising among Medicare beneficiaries despite significant advances in
HF therapies, and evidence suggests this may be partially due to gaps in health care access and affordability.
However, recent Medicare policy changes could meaningfully address these gaps, and ultimately improve HF
outcomes nationwide. One major change in the Medicare program has been the rapid growth of Medicare
Advantage (MA) plans, which now cover over 50% of all beneficiaries, and may be an important strategy to
improve HF care. In contrast to fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare, these private insurance plans receive capitated
payments from the government, and their design could impact HF patients in both beneficial and harmful ways.
In Aim 1, we will determine whether health care access, affordability, and clinical outcomes differ among
Medicare beneficiaries with HF enrolled in MA vs FFS Medicare, which is especially important given the
substantial burden of HF in Medicare. In addition to the rapid growth in MA, the recent passage of the Inflation
Reduction Act (IRA) has the potential to improve HF outcomes in Medicare. The IRA will cap annual OOP drug
costs at $2000/year and expand low-income subsidies for Medicare beneficiaries, which could have major
implications for those with HF. In Aim 2, we will use quasi-experimental approaches to determine whether the
IRA leads to real-world changes in OOP costs and associated improvements in medication adherence and
outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries with HF. Data on the real-world impact of the IRA will be critical as
policymakers consider strategies to improve HF outcomes in Medicare. Finally, as enrollment in MA continues
and the IRA is fully implemented, identifying ongoing and/or new barriers to HF care in Medicare will be critical.
In Aim 3, we will use semi-structured interviews of Medicare beneficiaries with HF and clinicians to identify
barriers in care access, affordability, and GDMT adherence, and novel strategies to address them. Qualitative
results from these interviews will serve as preliminary data for future studies that test and implement new
interventions to improve HF outcomes in Medicare. The overarching goal of this proposal is to use Medicare
claims, national survey, and qualitative data combined with advanced statistical methods to evaluate the
impact of new Medicare policies on the millions of beneficiaries with HF, and to identify emerging barriers to
care in this population. I will perform this work in the setting of a comprehensive career development plan
designed to provide me with the experience and skills necessary to become an independent research scientist.
My long-term career goal is to use mixed methods to evaluate how policies and interventions impact care
delivery and outcomes for HF patients, and I will use the research and skills from this K23 as a springboard for
an R01."

Bone formation by osteoblasts requires significant energy input to fuel the synthesis, deposition, and
mineralization of bone matrix. Fatty acids liberated by the lipolysis of triglycerides stored in adipose tissue are
a rich source of energy that is used to fuel the energy-intensive functions of a number of tissues. In this
application we will explore the interaction of bone and adipose tissue in response to two signals that stimulate
new bone formation: intermittent parathyroid hormone administration and exercise. Both of these stimuli are
also associated with increases in adipose tissue lipolysis. Our studies will determine the requirement for fatty
acids to be transferred from adipose to osteoblasts by examining bone formation in transgenic mouse models in
which lipolysis is impaired in adipocytes, via ablation of Atgl expression or fatty acid oxidation is impaired in
osteoblasts, via the ablation of Cpt2 expression. Our hypothesis predicts that manipulation of lipid metabolism
in either tissue will impair the bone formation response to each stimulus. Our approach will inform on the
integrative physiologic networks that regulate skeletal homeostasis and the energy substrates required for bone
formation during states of heighted anabolism. Additionally, these studies will enable us to define mechanisms
by which obesity and metabolic dysfunction, conditions which are now epidemic in our society, inhibit bone
formation"

The objective of “GREAT opportunities in Genome Science” is to create a comprehensive, 2-year mentored
research and professional development training program at California State University, Monterey Bay
(CSUMB) and in collaboration with the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) to train students who are
from historically underrepresented and low-income populations for careers in genomics. The training will be
focused on engaging students in a broad range of topics and research environments (both wet and dry labs at
UCSC). A GREAT student cohort will be recruited from STEM majors including Biology, Math & Statistics, and
Computer Science at CSUMB with the aim to identify them early in their academic careers and build a solid
foundation in genomics and well position them to begin research training. The GREAT cohort will include
students from rising juniors in the summer and Fall prior to the summer of research. Once a cohort is identified,
the preparatory activities will be initiated in the Fall semester of their Junior year, followed by assigning
students to CSUMB and UCSC mentors. The student will then be assigned to courses and workshops at
CSUMB in the Spring of Junior year. The training of the students will be conducted in collaboration with the
Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center at CSUMB. In the summer, students (now rising Seniors) will
be placed in labs to work with their UCSC mentors. When possible at UCSC, the GREAT students will be
placed in labs that are also hosting UCSC undergrads. This will encourage peer-to-peer mentoring and will
help build affinity between CSUMB and UCSC students and cultivate a sense of community. In the Fall of
senior year, students will return to CSUMB for two semesters of continued engagement with coursework and
continuation of research aligned with their summer lab research experience. Where possible, summer research
projects will continue through the academic year and the mentors will continue to support students in tandem
with CSUMB faculty. All GREAT scholars will also participate in professional development, genomics-specific
education, and graduate school preparation workshops and courses. Skills-based workshops will include
instruction in basic programming, data structures and algorithms, elementary statistics, and the use of UCSC-
based tools like the Genome Browser and the Xena Browser, while professional development and genomic
education course will cover instruction on science writing and communication, career pathway understanding,
responsible research conduct and ethics, legal and social implications issues in genomics, areas of specific
research inquiry in genomics, and other topics to support development of the scholars’ identities as scientists,
their scientific values, and their self-efficacy. Coordination of lab placement and summer activities at UCSC will
be managed by the Genomics Institute Office of Diversity Programs (GIOD). Through this project, five cohorts
of GREAT scholars will be extensively trained, and a platform will be established which will encourage and
guide other students to pursue their careers in the genome sciences."

The goal of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) is to develop a resource of null allele lines
for every protein-coding gene in the mouse genome and, through standardized, broad-based phenotyping,
catalog the biological function of each targeted gene. The NIH-funded Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Project
(KOMP2) has supported two previous phases of null allele production and phenotyping, contributing to more
than half of the null allele lines made and characterized by the IMPC. This application describes our plan for
Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) to continue as a KOMP2 site during a third phase of funding. We propose to
produce, cryopreserve, and phenotype null allele mouse lines for 600 protein coding genes. We have developed
a bioinformatics approach to identify and prioritize genes with known or putative human disease associations
but little-to-no in vivo functional annotation for null allele mouse line production. We will generate and validate
null alleles using established CRISPR genome editing approaches and quality control procedures, cryopreserve
all null allele lines using accepted techniques, and deliver germplasm to the MMRRC repositories for community-
wide distribution. These null allele lines represent a gold standard resource for the scientific community and an
important foundation for future research and translational studies. We will utilize our established pipelines to
perform broad-based, standardized adult phenotyping on all mutant lines and assess homozygous lethal and
subviable lines in an embryonic phenotyping pipeline. The phenotyping data we generate will provide
fundamental new insights into mammalian biology as well as the genetic bases of human disease. All allele and
phenotype data will be submitted in real time to the Data Coordination Center, ensuring the rapid dissemination
of all BCM data to the wider biomedical scientific community. We will continue our production and phenotyping
technology development programs, developing our own new approaches and adopting new methodologies from
the community as they arise. The BCM KOMP2 team has the established expertise, experience, and resources
to meet the proposed phase 3 goals in an efficient and cost-effective manner."
10868600,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hantaviruses are a family of zoonotic RNA viruses found in insectivore and rodent hosts worldwide. The Old
World hantaviruses, Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV), are the etiologic agents of hemorrhagic
fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), the most common hemorrhagic fever disease in Asia. Hantaviruses primarily
target endothelial cells for infection and drive vascular leakage and dysregulation, through poorly defined means.
In their respective reservoir hosts, hantaviruses establish asymptomatic, persistent infections. The mechanisms
underlying these divergent infection outcomes remain unknown and no therapeutic exists to treat HFRS. Our
previously published data demonstrates that type I interferon (IFN) effectively limits HTNV replication and that
the cytoplasmic RNA recognition receptors RIG-I and MDA5 are required for initiating the type I IFN response in
human endothelial cells during hantavirus infection. Here we show that, in contrast, SEOV infection in its natural
reservoir host does not result in innate immune transcriptional activation in vitro and, more interestingly, IFNβ
treatment does not limit SEOV replication in reservoir cells. Further, global transcriptomic analysis of human and
rat endothelial cells infected with SEOV reveal striking, host-specific patterns of differential gene expression for
the IFN and leukocyte extravasation pathways. Predicted network analysis identified differential regulation of the
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor signaling pathway, with increased gene expression related
to activation and migration in human endothelial cells compared to reservoir endothelial cells. These data, along
with substantial literature in the field demonstrating a significant effect of type I IFN on vascular function, lead us
to hypothesize that type I IFN signaling following SEOV infection in humans drives endothelial cell activation,
vascular dysregulation, and recruitment of proinflammatory neutrophils that are the hallmarks of HFRS. Further,
we hypothesize that the reservoir host for SEOV, the common rat, escapes severe disease through viral-induced
inhibition of type I IFN activation and reduced inflammation. We will test this hypothesis by: 1) dissecting the
virus-host interactions that initiate and antagonize reservoir and non-reservoir innate immunity, 2) investigating
the contribution of type I IFN signaling to vascular dysfunction in SEOV-infected endothelial cells, and 3) defining
the role of type I IFN signaling in neutrophil activation and extravasation across SEOV-infected endothelial cells
from reservoir and human hosts. While similar comparative immunology approaches to understanding
pathogenesis for other zoonotic RNA viruses have been successful, the limited tractability of most reservoir
rodent hosts has significantly limited progress in the hantavirus field. Thus, the intentional selection to study
SEOV and its natural reservoir, the common laboratory rat, provides us with the genomic and immunologic
resources to complete a novel, in depth investigation into the immunopathogenic mechanisms underlying
hantavirus disease in humans."

Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent psychiatric conditions in adolescents and are associated with
functional impairment and symptomatic distress. When untreated, they result in persistent disability into
adulthood. Moreover, nearly 40% of pediatric patients with anxiety disorders fail to respond to the first-line
psychopharmacologic treatment—selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)—and up to 70% will
experience treatment-limiting side effects. Identifying predictors of treatment response in pediatric patients
provides an opportunity to (1) optimize treatment, (2) forestall the development of secondary psychopathology
and suicide attempts and (3) restore normal psychosocial function and quality of life. In this regard, in adults,
pharmacogenetically (PGx)-guided antidepressant treatment increases efficacy, decreases side effect burden
and reduces treatment costs; however, these PGx studies involving adults focus almost exclusively on
medication selection rather than dosing. Currently, there are no such pediatric trials. Despite the availability of
PGx dosing guidelines for adults, blinded, randomized trials of PGx-guided SSRI dosing have never been
conducted (even in adults). Compared to adults, SSRI-related side effects and pharmacokinetics significantly
differ in adolescents. This proposal aims to test whether PGx-guided dosing of the SSRI, escitalopram,
improves efficacy and tolerability in adolescents with anxiety disorders. We will measure treatment response
with the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS, a validated measure of pediatric anxiety symptom severity)
after 12 weeks of escitalopram treatment. Additionally, activation and weight gain—two significant side effects
of SSRIs in youth—will be assessed with the Treatment Emergent Activation and Suicidality Assessment
Profile and body mass index (BMI) during the 12 week trial. Adolescents with anxiety disorders (N=132) will be
randomized (1:1) to receive (1) standard or (2) PGx-guided escitalopram dosing. We expect greater reduction
in PARS scores over time (i.e., better response) with PGx-guided dosing compared to standard dosing.
Further, we expect more patients to experience activation and treatment-related BMI increases with standard
dosing compared to PGx-guided dosing. Additionally, we will examine the influence of CYP2C19 metabolizer
status on escitalopram pharmacokinetics and will determine the impact of serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and
receptor (HTR2A) variants on treatment response. For treatment of pediatric anxiety to move beyond the
current ""one-size fits all"" approach, PGx-guided SSRI dosing strategies are urgently needed. This study will
provide clinicians, patients, parents, and payers the evidence to determine whether PGx-guided escitalopram
dosing in pediatric anxiety disorders has clinical utility."
10871707,"The highest incidence of tuberculosis disease (TB) in the world is in India, accounting for 27% of all new cases
globally, with approximately 86,000 among persons with HIV (PWH). Unhealthy alcohol use triples the risk of
TB in the general population, increasing susceptibility to primary infection and reactivation, and also leads to
poor TB outcomes including decreased treatment adherence, treatment failure, default and death. Among
PWH, unhealthy alcohol use is associated with decreased use of and adherence to antiretroviral therapy
(ART), lower viral suppression and increased mortality. Our work in India demonstrates not only high
prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use among patients with TB, but also that it is one of the major reasons for
treatment default, failure, and mortality. With the high prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use and its association
with adverse TB and HIV treatment outcomes in low and middle income countries (LMIC), it is imperative to
test scalable, culturally relevant, evidence-based alcohol interventions and measure implementation factors to
facilitate more rapid integration of effective interventions into TB and HIV/TB care. To this end, we propose
HATHI (Hybrid trial for Alcohol reduction among people with TB and HIV in India). This 2-arm hybrid type 1
effectiveness-implementation RCT will examine the effectiveness of CAP (Counseling on Alcohol Problems), a
four-session combined Cognitive Behavioral Therapy/Motivational Enhancement Therapy alcohol reduction
intervention integrated into HIV/TB and TB care, compared with usual care (provider advice, referral to
treatment as needed). Patients (n=450) with TB (n=225) and HIV/TB co-infection (n=225) and unhealthy
alcohol use will be recruited from TB and HIV clinics at 2 large, well-established research and care centers in
Pune, Maharashtra India. Effectiveness outcomes measured at 3, 6 and 12 months include 1) self-reported
alcohol use and phosphatidyl ethanol (PEth), an alcohol biomarker, and 2) TB and HIV clinical outcomes
including TB and HIV medication adherence, HIV viral suppression, TB sputum/culture conversion and the
composite outcome of TB treatment failure, default or death. Using the RE-AIM implementation framework, we
will use mixed methods to assess barriers and facilitators to alcohol treatment integration in TB and HIV/TB
clinical settings and the incremental costs of this intervention strategy. This hybrid effectiveness-
implementation study addresses the huge burden of unhealthy alcohol use among persons with TB and
TB/HIV in India, the country with the highest burden of TB, 3rd highest burden of HIV, and where unhealthy
alcohol use is a significant contributor to unfavorable treatment outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team of
epidemiologists, clinicians, health economists and behavioral scientists has a successful track record for
conducting clinical trials and alcohol interventions in the US and India. Our research will provide much-needed
evidence to inform local and global policy, and improve outcomes for persons most affected by HIV, TB, and
unhealthy alcohol use."

 The population of older adults living with traumatic brain injury (TBI) has increased precipitously in the
last decade. Current clinical care guidelines for TBI do not offer any specific recommendations for the clinical
care of older adults, despite substantial evidence that primary injury mechanisms and secondary injury sequela
are markedly different in older as compared to their younger counterparts. In addition to increased rates of
incident TBI in this age cohort, many individuals who have sustained TBI earlier in life are surviving to older
age and living with chronic disability from their injuries. There is a need for research to better understand the
short-term and longer-term clinical care needs for older persons living with TBI. Existing hospital-based
registries and TBI cohort studies have limited information on health care use after discharge from acute and
post-acute health care settings; therefore, our current knowledge of health care needs for older adults living
with TBI are confined by these limitations. The use of Medicare data linked to existing research cohorts is
widely practiced in other biomedical fields, but these linkage methods are under-utilized in TBI research.
 The overall objectives of this K99/R00 proposal are to characterize the health, function, and clinical
care pathways among older adults with TBI by leveraging Medicare claims combined with multiple data
resources, including: the National Trauma Databank, Health and Retirement Study, and TBI Model Systems
National Database. The K99 specific aims are: 1) to identify prognostic characteristics associated with the
proportion of time spent in different health care settings in the first year after post-acute TBI care admission,
and 2) to compare function, health, and health care utilization and cost among current older adults with remote
TBI exposure, incident TBI in later life, and no history of TBI. 3) During the R00 portion of the grant, we will
use probabilistic matching to link the TBI Model Systems National Database with Medicare claims to develop a
rich new infrastructure that will support future investigation into associations between rehabilitation care
utilization patterns and longitudinal patient-reported TBI outcomes among current older adults with TBI. This
innovate research exploits unique strengths from multiple complementary existing data resources in hospital
and community-based settings to address novel TBI rehabilitation-relevant questions.
 The proposed research and training plan will address the following knowledge gaps during the K99
period: 1) training in analysis of administrative claims and cost data, 2) analysis of population-based databases
for rehabilitation research, 3) training in data linkage and harmonization, 4) understanding the health care
experiences of older adults with TBI and their caregivers, and 5) refining skills in grant writing. The knowledge
gained from the proposed research and training is significant because it will advance our knowledge of the
health and health care needs of current older adults living with TBI to inform age-appropriate models of care."

Dry eye disease (DED) affects millions of Americans, causing discomfort, vision problems, pain, and potential
ocular surface damage. The prevalence of DED is higher in women than men, and there may be molecular
differences among racial groups. Tear fluid, which can be collected non-invasively, holds promise for
identifying DED biomarkers. Our hypothesis is that the molecular composition of tear fluid can distinguish DED
subtypes and correlate with clinical signs and severity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) in circulation have shown great
stability and resistance to degradation over long-term storage. Therefore, miRNAs present in tear fluid hold
significant promise for clinical biomarkers, complementing proteins.
In this proposal, we aim to analyze a large sample set (n=800) to discover sex- and race-specific differences in
tear miRNAs and proteins and their relationship to disease severity and subtypes. By considering diverse
populations, confounding factors, and integrating multi-omics data, we will identify reliable biomarkers
applicable in clinical settings. We anticipate that discovering tear biomarkers will improve DED diagnosis and
enable personalized treatment based on each patient's tear composition. Personalized medicine approaches
accounting for sex and race-specific factors will guide tailored treatments, improving outcomes for DED
patients.
Furthermore, we will explore the interplay between tear miRNAs and proteins, investigating potential
connections and novel molecular mechanisms. Machine learning will be employed to deepen our
understanding of the underlying molecular processes involved in DED subtypes and provide insights into
therapeutic targets and interventions.
Finally, we will create a reference database compiling a comprehensive profile of miRNAs and proteins
detected in human tear fluid. This freely accessible database will include demographic parameters, clinical
histories, and functional tools for data analysis and visualization. It will serve as a valuable resource for vision
researchers studying the expression patterns of molecules of interest in human tears, facilitating further
investigations and advancements in the field."

The pulmonary mesenchyme, which includes fibroblasts and smooth muscle, provides critical support for
resident epithelial progenitors, but how it contributes to lung injury resolution is unclear. As a barrier organ the
lung is constantly exposed to inhaled particulates, allergens, and respiratory pathogens. This barrage of
exposures is countered by mucous secretions, antimicrobial agents, and sentinel immune cells. In the case of a
more severe insult that causes lung damage, the inflammatory response and activation of wound-healing
fibroblasts ensues. The research program described here seeks to elucidate how signaling between resident
fibroblasts and immune cells controls the length and successful outcome of the lung injury repair response.
Further, this research will test a new model proposed for the origins of human lung disease by testing how
dysfunctional epithelial cells perpetuate the inflammation-driven fibroblast response. The overarching goal of this
program is to determine the molecular pathways utilized by distinct fibroblast subsets and how they converge to
shape the immune status of the lung. These questions will be explored by using our unique genetic mouse
models for fibroblast lineages and in vivo models of respiratory dysfunction including chemical-induced injury or
influenza infection. Moreover, we propose to employ a combination of sequencing analysis and establish novel
organoid models to explore the interactions of fibroblast subsets and tissue resident immune cells. Together, our
efforts will provide new insights in the mechanisms of lung repair resolution and build a foundation for novel
future contributions."

This is an application for competitive renewal of an institutional training grant. The intent of this program is to
prepare clinically trained MDs, MD/PhDs, and PhDs for a career in preclinical, clinical and translational
research in mood, eating, or anxiety disorders. Physician trainees are eligible if they have completed the PGY
3 year of psychiatry training or PGY 4 year of neurology; psychology trainees are eligible if they have
completed an APA approved clinical internship. The program is centered on mood, anxiety, and eating
disorders, reflecting the ongoing and long-standing research interests of the core faculty involved in the
program. Fellows work with a mentor who is a member of the Stanford University faculty for a period of two
years on projects related to the phenomenology, clinical biology (including brain imaging), basic neuroscience
(including optogenetics), and translational treatment outcomes in the three major classes of disorders. The
Program includes formal seminars in research methodology, clinical research design and statistical analysis.
Additionally, all fellows are required to take a course focused on ethics in medical research. Trainees also have
access to a wide array of more specialized course work. Mentorship emphasizes development of an
independent career and fellows are expected to design and conduct their own research projects and apply for
their own funding to support their research post fellowship. An Executive Committee, representing the principal
areas of research, provides program oversight including continual review of both the program and trainees'
progress towards their individual goals. The program also offers summer stipends for medical students
interested in psychiatric research.
The Program is now in its 25th year. Fifty postgraduate trainees (12 MDs, 10 MD/PhDs and 28 PhDs) and 28
pre-doctoral summer medical students have been in the program in the past 15 years. Graduating fellows have
been successful in obtaining faculty positions around the US and Canada, as well as in obtaining their own
research funding—NIH Career Development Awards, R01s; NIMH Director Awards (e.g., Pioneer Awards),
NARSAD Young Investigator Awards, Klingenstein Foundation Awards, etc. Six fellows left before completing
the full 2 years: four accepted tenure line faculty positions and two segued into full-time clinical positions at
community-based programs, such as the PAVA. Building on the success of our program in attaining its goals,
we aim to continue to train promising clinically trained fellows to become independent mental health
researchers."
10877676,"The field of medicine is experiencing a genomics revolution. The need to train physician scientists and
investigators of diverse backgrounds experienced in genomic and genetic methodologies and able to translate
basic science discoveries in genomics into clinical care has never been greater. The major goal of this
postdoctoral research training program is to train the future leaders of Medical Genetics and Genomics who
will emerge from a variety of training pathways with varying amounts of research experience. Postdoctoral
trainees with M.D. or M.D., Ph.D. degrees with clinical training in Medical Genetics, Pediatrics, Medicine,
Psychiatry, Pathology, and other specialty areas will be eligible for support from this training grant. Funding for
5 training slots per year is sought. The clinical training years (typically year 1 for Categorical Medical Genetics
trainees and years 1-3 for combined Pediatric and Medical Genetics trainees) is funded by the Perelman
School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) and The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia
(CHOP), while funds for the research years of the overall training program are sought from this training grant.
During the Medical Genetics Research Fellowship years supported by this Training Grant, the fellow devotes a
minimum of 85% effort to research in a basic science laboratory. Research opportunities are extremely diverse
with training in the laboratories of 42 Faculty from 6 core departments at CHOP/UPenn. Fields of research may
encompass those areas that impact human genetics including, but not limited to: genomics, molecular
genetics, cytogenomics, biochemical genetics, epigenetics, mitochondrial genetics, developmental biology,
cellular biology, bioinformatics, systems biology, pharmacogenetics, gene therapy and others. During the
research years, the trainee also takes seminar courses, attends journal clubs, research meetings, and
departmental research retreats, and carries out minimal clinical activities, not to exceed 15% effort. Training
stipends for the 2-3 years of research are requested in this application. The M.D. trainee will likely require
further research training (not covered by this training grant), which might be acquired through an additional
postdoctoral research experience or a protected faculty appointment with considerable mentoring from a senior
faculty member. The training program outlined in this proposal is built on our past rack record of success and is
committed to recruiting a diverse group of highly talented postdoctoral trainees to a rich and supportive
research environment and through a rigorous program of training, mentorship and oversight develop the future
physician-scientist leaders in Medical Genetics and Genomics."
10877789,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is the most common genetic cause of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). Individuals with AATD have extremely low levels of plasma AAT, a serine
protease inhibitor that inactivates neutrophil elastase and matrix metalloproteinases to maintain the
protease-antiprotease balance in the lung. Although research has contributed to an understanding of
the pathogenesis of AATD much remains to be defined regarding its natural history, treatment
strategies and clinical course. The most fundamental barrier to effective therapeutic approaches to
AATD is a lack of suitable biomarkers that are specific for disease progression or correlate with a
specific disease phenotype. Furthermore, we lack a complete understanding of the genetic and
phenotypic characteristics of this disease. Therefore, the present initiative will first form a prospective
cohort of individuals with AATD (Alpha-1 Clinical Cohort, A1CC) and subsequently identify individuals
from that cohort to enter into a biomarker study through the collaborative Alpha-1 Biomarker Research
Consortium (A1BReC). In the context of the A1BReC, fundamental studies will be performed to
elucidate genotype/phenotype relationships in the disease and explore further mechanistic studies in
the pathogenesis of AATD.
UG3 Phase: The primary goal of this phase will be in collaboration with the Alpha-1 Foundation to
place the present Alpha-1 contact registry into a fully integrated and user-friendly Alpha-1 Clinical
Cohort managed by the Alpha-1 Foundation. The A1CC will provide for public data access of de-
identified information through an i2b2 query module. The secondary goal is to finalize the study
protocol, informed consent, manual of procedures, execute clinical site contracts and gain IRB
approvals for the UH3 phase of the protocol.
UH3 Phase: To test the hypothesis that biomarkers in serum and sputum of a population of AATD
with lung disease will correlate with imaging biomarkers that can predict prognosis and outcome of
disease and identify genotype/phenotype correlations in a population of AATD patients with lung
disease through comparisons with AATD patients without lung disease."
10877790,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell fate transitions prompt widespread changes in gene expression programs that require multiple levels of
regulation to specify and ultimately restrict cell identity. Post-transcriptional mechanisms are fundamental
regulators of gene expression and have recently emerged as critical to establishing and maintaining cell identity.
However, the role of post-transcriptional mechanisms in development and tissue homeostasis remains poorly
understood. The long-term goal of my research program is to define the role of post-transcriptional regulation in
mammalian cell fate decisions in order to develop new therapeutic strategies for regenerative medicine and
cancer. The objective of this proposal is to characterize the function of post-transcriptional mechanisms in
embryogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis. Our central hypothesis is that the sequestration of RNAs in
cytoplasmic condensates has crucial roles during developmental transitions and is important to maintain cellular
identity and tissue homeostasis. Although cytoplasmic RNA condensates are thought to play important roles in
various RNA-related processes, their molecular function and role in mammalian cell fate transitions are poorly
understood. In the first Project, we will elucidate how RNA sequestration instructs embryonic cell fate transitions.
We will track early lineage decisions following perturbation of RNA sequestration in early embryos. Moreover,
we will define the first landscape of RNA condensates in embryonic stem cells as well as endoderm, ectoderm,
and mesoderm progenitors. We then will assess how transcript isoforms and RNA methylation influence
compartment-specific regulation of RNAs in pluripotent stem cells. In the second Project, we will determine the
role of post-transcriptional mechanisms during tissue homeostasis. Specifically, we will explore the cellular,
molecular, and functional role of RNA sequestration in hematopoiesis. Further, we will utilize several innovative
tools and cutting-edge technologies, including profiling of the RNA content of cytoplasmic condensates and
translatome mapping in hematopoietic stem cells, to dissect the mechanisms by which RNA sequestration
controls hematopoietic cell identity. Collectively, this work will reveal how RNA processing drives key aspects of
lineage-specific mammalian cell fate trajectories. Uncovering and understanding novel regulatory mechanisms
that control cell fate decisions is a crucial step to develop approaches for regenerative medicine and cancer.
We, therefore, anticipate that the proposed work will have important implications for both basic science and
translational medicine."
10877795,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a common malformation that affects about 40,000 births each year in the United States alone. While surgical innovations have dramatically improved survival in children with CHD, the poor neurocognitive outcome of survivors is a grave concern, raising questions about effects of chronic hypoxemia on brain development. Neonatal white-matter injuries (WMI) including hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and periventricular leukomalacia are the most common causes of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes such as cerebral palsy in neonates with CHD. The white matter comprises axons that are insulated by myelinating oligodendrocytes. Because, myelin formation is a metabolically demanding process, it requires adequate blood flow, nutrient and oxygen delivery supplied through vascular network in the white matter tracts. Cardiac structural defects during development lead to outflow tract misalignment in CHD and can compromise the fetal circulation and cerebral oxygen delivery resulting in myelination deficits and WMI. During my postdoctoral studies, I made a striking discovery that OPC density is a direct regulator of white matter angiogenesis. Using a novel mouse model of CHD that mimics structural right to left shunt defects of transposition of great arteries (TGA), double outlet right ventricle and ventricular septal defects observed in human CHD, I also uncovered abnormal vascularization of neonatal white matter in this condition. The goal of this proposal is to understand mechanisms by which OPCs regulate white matter vascular development and how the resulting vascular network provides essential metabolic support to protect the neonatal brain subject to chronic hypoxemia, as is typical in CHD. During the K99 phase, I propose to characterize white matter OPC- endothelial cell interactions and the underlying molecular pathways in our mouse model of CHD using advanced spatial transcriptomics and live imaging approaches and further validate them in postmortem brain tissue obtained from human cases of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy to understand their relevance to human disease. I will next combine mouse genetics and hypoxic injury models to understand how disruption in these pathways impact white matter vascularization and myelination. Using cutting-edge proteomics technique, I will further elucidate the downstream oligodendroglial specific-signaling network alterations in these conditions. This work will be carried out under the mentorship of Drs. David Rowitch and Stephen Fancy, leaders in white matter development, neonatal white matter injury and glia-vascular cross talk. Complementary mentorship will be provided by Drs. Eric Huang, Patrick Mcquillen and Alma Burlingame experts in neuropathology, neurodevelopment in CHD and mass spectrometry-based proteomics approaches respectively. During the independent R00 phase, I will investigate how disruption in white matter vascular development or abnormal blood flow cause metabolic dysfunction in oligodendrocytes and explore small molecule candidates to target the affected signaling networks to rescue the myelination deficits seen in these hypoxemic conditions. These efforts will provide mechanistic insights into a bidirectional crosstalk between oligodendroglial cells and vascular network in the developing white matter, and how they are altered in neonatal brain injury seen in CHD, Preterm Birth and Pediatric Stroke."
10877677,"Summary/Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is a public health crisis compounded by the insufficient
number of skilled clinicians and investigators with high quality training and expertise to provide care and
conduct translational research. It is vital to foster a new generation of physician researchers that possess a
diverse array of knowledge and skills, including understanding basic (genetics, molecular and cellular biology,
neuroscience), patient level (clinical care, neuropsychology, fluid biomarkers, neuroimaging, epidemiology),
and cross cutting (biostatistics, ethics) research design and methods. Thus our proposed SMAART T35
program will grow the pipeline of medical students with research experiences inspiring new physician scientists
to focus their careers in the ADRD space. The low availability of skilled ADRD translational physician scientists
represents a threat to the national ADRD research agenda. Therefore, in this T35 application we propose to
engage MD students in hands on research, mentoring, publishing, career development and leadership.
Through our leadership expertise in multidisciplinary translational ADRD research we aim to enhance the
diversity and availability of physician scientists through these three specific aims: 1) Champion mentored
career development by providing an integrated program that consists of outstanding leadership and oversight
at all levels. 2) Create a flexible and innovative curriculum that emphasizes both core and advanced
competencies in clinical, translational, and basic science 3) Maximizing access to Summer Mentoring and
Research Training (SMAART) Program. Through formal check ins and ADRD themed journal clubs, trainees
will receive guidance and support from the Program directors. The program will longitudinally track students
through the four years of medical school encouraging continued engagement in research activities."
10877678,"Project Summary
 Large randomized trials have found that intensive lifestyle interventions (ILI) and metformin are safe and
effective treatment options for promoting modest weight loss and preventing type 2 diabetes (T2D) among adults
with prediabetes. However, these treatments are rarely used in practice, and little existing research has focused
on patient-centered approaches for promoting their use. One potential approach, behavioral nudges, involves
manipulating health messages and treatment options to make behavior change more likely and easier to enact.
While a large body of evidence suggests that behavioral nudges are effective, they have not been definitively
studied for T2D prevention. We will address this critical knowledge gap by conducting the Behavioral Nudges for
Diabetes Prevention (BEGIN) Trial. The proposed study will take place in primary care clinics, whose
unprecedented reach and regular interaction with prediabetic adults make this an ideal setting for translational
T2D prevention research. This definitive study will test two low-touch interventions: 1) In-person intervention
consisting of a prediabetes decision aid designed to nudge uptake of evidence-based treatments and delivered
by health educators; and 2) Automated intervention consisting of motivational letters and text messages that
deliver similar information and use the same behavioral nudges. The proposed R18 study will accomplish the
following specific aims to determine the most effective low-touch intervention that promotes maximal treatment
adoption and weight loss. In Aim 1, we will engage national stakeholders in T2D prevention to finalize and
integrate the automated intervention components for maximal sustainability and scalability. Aim 2 is a pragmatic
clinic-level cluster RCT examining the weight loss effectiveness of the in-person and automated interventions.
Our full factorial design allows us to test each intervention, both individually and combined, vs. usual care. The
proposed pragmatic trial of 984 primary care patients with prediabetes and overweight/obesity will estimate the
effects of these low-touch interventions on the following 12-month outcomes: change in weight (primary) and
adoption of ILI and/or metformin (secondary). Change in weight and hemoglobin A1c from baseline to 24 months
are examined as exploratory outcomes. Aim 3 uses mixed methods to examine the proposed interventions'
reach, adoption, implementation, maintenance, and cost. This study will be conducted in a large community
health center, in which 95% of patients with prediabetes are racial/ethnic minorities and 83% live in poverty. Our
proposal is responsive to PAR-18-925 by: 1) recruiting a vulnerable study population that shoulders a
disproportionate burden of T2D and is underrepresented in clinical research; 2) studying low-touch interventions
that are truly pragmatic, that have great potential for sustainability and scalability, and that our partner clinic
system has already used in some form before; 3) leveraging existing staff and substantial data resources related
to T2D prevention; and 4) collaborating with an experienced clinical partner that is committed to continued
implementation of the proposed interventions beyond the study period."

clinical background in both rheumatology and pulmonology with an excellent scientific foundation in chemical
biology and translational immunology from both her Ph.D. studies and her post-doctoral research studies
following clinical training. Her long-term career plan is to become a leading physician-scientist in inflammatory
myositis focused on the use of cutting-edge technologies to identify disease pathogenesis and novel
therapeutic targets. To achieve this, her immediate goal is to (1) learn the requisite bioinformatic techniques to
independently analyze high-dimensional immunophenotypic and transcriptional profiles and integrate these
profiles with clinical outcomes, and (2) apply molecular immunology techniques to determine dysregulated
pathways in IIM-specific cell populations.
Research Project: This proposal will study the underlying immunologic heterogeneity of IIM and identify
associations between immune/transcriptional signatures and clinical characteristics. Dr. Wilfong will (1) identify
immune signatures and transcriptional aberrancies in IIM using a cross-sectional IIM cohort and (2) correlate
immune features with ILD progression in a longitudinal IIM cohort. She will also take a prior single-cell RNA-
Seq finding and (3) perform mechanistic studies investigate how upregulation of the redox sensor TXNIP alters
immunometabolism in Jo1+ anti-tRNA synthetase syndrome.

Depression is a leading cause of disability in the United States. Patients with limited English proficiency (LEP),
particularly Asians and Latinos, who represent the largest demographics with LEP in the country, are at
increased risk of poor provider recognition of depressive symptoms and under-treatment of depression.
Universal depression screening in primary care, with a focus on initial depression treatment, may be a way to
systematically identify patients with LEP who could benefit from treatment. However, barriers to depression
care are likely multifactorial and are still poorly understood. The objective of this application is to understand
whether universal approaches to depression screening and initial care for depression are equally effective for
all groups, or whether targeted efforts are needed to increase depression screening, diagnosis and treatment
in primary care among patients with LEP. Within the context of a primary care setting, the specific aims are to
(1) evaluate differences in depression screening and initial treatment by patient preferred language after
adoption of annual universal depression screening, (2) examine patterns of patient-provider communication
about depressive symptoms, and (3) to involve key stakeholders to develop a patient- and provider-facing,
practice-based intervention prototype to improve annual depression screening, elicit patient concerns and
treatment preferences, foster improved communication and patient empowerment about initial treatment, and
increase engagement in depression care.
These aims will be achieved using mixed methods and health disparities research frameworks, and they
address the NIMHD research priority areas of developing healthcare interventions to reduce health disparities
and to improve patient-clinician communication and shared-decision making. The studies are novel in their
focus on the mental health needs of primary care patients with LEP as well as the proposed use of mixed
methods to develop a theory-driven intervention prototype. The proposed studies are informed by Dr. Maria
Esteli Garcia’s experience as an internist working in diverse, urban primary care settings. Dr. Garcia’s long-
term career goal is to improve depression care for patients with LEP in primary care. During the course of this
award, Dr. Garcia will undertake didactic and experiential training to improve knowledge and skills in three
areas: (1) mixed methods, (2) evidence-based depression care, and (3) experimental designs for use in real
world settings. Dr. Garcia has assembled a mentorship team with expertise in mixed methods, health services
and implementation science research, evidence-based depression treatment, and intervention design to
ensure completion of the proposed research and training and successful transition to independence.
Ultimately, these projects are expected to provide the foundation for future R34 and R01 applications and
further refinement of an intervention to reduce mental health disparities by improving depression screening and
initial depression care for patients with LEP."
10877802,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) helps patients with prediabetes initiate lifestyle changes and delay or
prevent T2DM. However, the DPP has been most successful in middle-class populations. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-supported National Diabetes Prevention Program achieved widespread
implementation but had limited reach and effectiveness in low-income communities. In a major step forward,
California has mandated in Senate Bill 97 that as of January 1, 2019, all eligible Medicaid (e.g., Medi-Cal)
beneficiaries who want to enroll in the DPP must be provided this opportunity. The outcomes of SB 97 will
have major implications on diabetes prevention for Medicaid beneficiaries not only in California but also across
the US. We are proposing an evaluation of SB 97 using data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California
(KPNC) and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Using advanced analytic approaches, we will
evaluate the effects of this natural experiment on clinical outcomes. We will also collect important contextual
primary data from the 43 CDC-recognized or pending DPP suppliers in California, and from both DPP lifestyle
coaches and DPP participants.
Our Specific Aims are as follows: 1) To determine the effectiveness of SB 97 and mandated Medi-Cal DPP
coverage on change in body weight (primary outcome), systolic blood pressure (SBP), uptake of the DPP in-
person or online, and projected future cost savings (all secondary outcomes) among Medi-Cal beneficiaries
with prediabetes at KPNC and UCLA, versus a comparison cohort of patients with insurance coverage from the
California Health Insurance Exchange (HIE). 2) To characterize perspectives from leaders of CDC-recognized
DPP suppliers including decisions about providing DPP to Medi-Cal beneficiaries, such as their processes of
identifying the target population, raising awareness of and promoting the DPP, and recruiting and enrolling
eligible participants. 3) To characterize perspectives of Medi-Cal DPP participants and DPP lifestyle coaches
on facilitators and barriers to participant retention and engagement. Our team includes a collaborative group of
health services researchers, a statistician, and a health economist with experience in program evaluation and
outcomes research, who have a longstanding working relationship. If funded, we are well positioned and ready
to initiate the proposed policy evaluation in the post-enactment period."
10877803,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Covalent attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) to other proteins is among the most widespread and
diverse modes of eukaryotic cellular regulation. The modification occurs on practically every
protein in a cell at some point in its lifetime and is itself highly diverse. The type of ubiquitylation
determines a product’s fate and a protein may undergo different modes of ubiquitylation
depending on cellular circumstances. The origins of this diversity stem from the protein
machinery responsible for Ub attachment. A trio of enzymes, E1, E2, and E3 coordinate the
process, with several E1s, dozens of E2s, and many hundreds of E3s encoded in the human
genome. Over the past 20 years, we have asked fundamental questions about how E2s and
E3s work and have contributed to the structural, biochemical, and mechanistic understandings
of the field. Our work began with the breast cancer tumor suppressor, BRCA1/BARD1 that was
among the earliest RING-type E3 ligases to be identified. Over the years, we have expanded to
study numerous E3s and E2s, making many unexpected discoveries along the way.
The wide reach of protein ubiquitylation in cellular function means that dysfunction of
components is associated with myriad human diseases and developmental issues. Such
associations make the Ub system attractive for therapeutic targeting. Direct targeting of the
ubiquitylation machinery as well as efforts to re-engineer protein ubiquitylation machinery to
selectively target a specific cellular protein are both proving to be powerful strategies. Such
translational efforts rely implicitly on mechanistic understanding and reveal the power of well-
grounded structure/function research. Despite the apparent maturity of the field, there is still
much we do not understand at a fundamental level. We do not know the full range of
biochemical reactions carried out by the ~30 human E2s as fully one-quarter of these are
uncharacterized. Existing data reveal that not all E2s carry out the presumed reaction that
attaches Ub to lysine sidechains, implying the existence of ubiquitylated species that have yet to
be investigated in cells. Second, understanding of how E2/E3s carry out mono-ubiquitylation is
lacking. Unlike poly-ubiquitylation, attachment of a single Ub (mono-Ub) tends to occur in a site-
selective manner implying that substrates to be mono-ubiquitylated are handled differently from
those destined to have chains built upon them. Third, lack of knowledge regarding how mono-
Ub attachment affects the structure and function of proteins limits understanding of how the
modification regulates critical cellular processes including transcription, translation, and DNA
damage response, among others."

 This study will examine a new implementation strategy for the Youth Readiness Intervention (YRI), an
evidence-based mental health intervention. The strategy will (a) leverage a delivery setting (schools) and
workforce (teachers) used effectively in low- and middle- income countries; and (b) innovate with technology
and mHealth tools to enhance mental health service delivery quality. The YRI will be implemented as an
extracurricular resilience-building afterschool activity in Sierra Leone. Teachers will deliver the YRI and receive
either mobile phone-supported supervision or standard in-person supervision. Mobile-based supervision will
integrate WhatsApp, a free cross-platform messaging and voice service used widely throughout Africa, with a
new mHealth app. The mHealth app was recently designed to support fidelity monitoring of Sierra Leonean lay
workers delivering the evidence-based Family Strengthening Intervention (R21MH124071). The mHealth app
will support supervision through key features, including voice activated content, fillable forms (i.e., YRI fidelity
checklist), visual dashboards to monitor fidelity, and training videos to support school-based YRI delivery.
 The Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework, a broad multilevel, context-
sensitive implementation science model, will guide the study. A hybrid type 3 implementation-effectiveness
design will allow for evaluation of both mobile phone-based supervision as a new implementation strategy, and
clinical effectiveness of the YRI on youth mental and behavioral health as secondary outcomes.
 Aim 1 (Exploration and Preparation) will investigate barriers and facilitators to successful YRI
implementation aided by mobile-based tools in Sierra Leone’s secondary schools. A mixed methods evaluation
with teachers, principals, and government ministry officials will inform co-development of an implementation
blueprint prior to YRI delivery. User-centered design methods will be used to adapt the mHealth supervision
app and incorporate WhatsApp to create an integrated user model of mobile phone-based supervision. Aim 2
(Implementation) will examine the feasibility, acceptability, cost, and fidelity to the YRI delivered by teachers
receiving mobile-based supervision compared with those receiving standard supervision via a mixed methods
approach. Aim 3 (Impact of Delivery Approach on YRI Effectiveness) will compare the effectiveness of the YRI
in improving mental health, emotion regulation and daily functioning in youth (aged 14-24) when delivered in
school settings by teachers who receive either mobile-based supervision (N=480 youth) or those who receive
standard supervision (N=480 youth). Aim 4 (Sustainment) will (a) investigate mechanisms of adoption and
sustainment of the YRI delivered by teachers through a mixed methods evaluation with teachers, youth, and
principals; and (b) conduct a cost-effectiveness and return on investment analysis to evaluate relative costs vs.
benefits of the YRI from a broad societal perspective, including educational outcomes."

C. difficile is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and nosocomial infection. Antibiotic treatment is
the standard approach in managing C. difficile infection (CDI) and is associated with high recurrence rates of up
to 65% depending on the number of previous disease. Alanyl-glutamine prevents C. difficile toxin-induced
impairment of cell migration and proliferation in intestinal cell lines, secretion and histopathology in animal ileal
tissues, and increased apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. We have shown that in the mouse model of CDI, alanyl-
glutamine supplementation significantly reduced diarrhea, weight loss, histopathology, relapse and deaths in
vancomycin-treated mice. A small pilot study in human suggests that alanyl-glutamine may prevent recurrent
disease up to 6 months after CDI treatment. We hypothesize that supplementation with alanyl-glutamine will
improve outcomes of treatment of CDI in humans. To prove this hypothesis, we plan to conduct a
randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The specific aims of this project are 3-fold. First, we shall
determine the optimal dose of oral alanyl-glutamine on preventing recurrence and deaths in patients
treated with standard anti-C.difficile agents. Secondly, we shall demonstrate the safety of oral alanyl-
glutamine supplementation. And thirdly, we shall test the effect of alanyl-glutamine on intestinal
inflammation, barrier function and gut flora in patients undergoing standard treatment for CDI. This
research proposal will allow for a rigorous, safe and productive performance of the clinical trial to prove the
benefit of alanyl-glutamine in human disease, potentially introducing a novel approach to treatment of CDI."
10881772,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in developed countries. A common treatment for
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is placement of an arterial stent. While stent technology has improved
over the years, including the development of drug-eluting stents, failure rates remain high and current
technologies are associated with significant challenges. Thus, there is a great need for new stent technology
that will improve patient outcomes following percutaneous cardiac and peripheral vascular interventions. We
propose to develop an innovative, paradigm-shifting stent technology that will obviate the need for
placement of permanent metal stents in the arterial system for the treatment of severe atherosclerosis.
Specifically, we propose to develop a solid biodegradable stent from a liquid drug-eluting polymer by
photo-polymerizing the stent in the body using a specially designed triple balloon catheter. This
“designer therapy” will be tailored to the contours of the individual artery and coat the entire surface of the
artery, significantly reducing the thrombogenic potential at the site of injury and providing the greatest surface
area for drug delivery. Our biodegradable poly(dodecanediol citrate) (PDDC) stent will deliver nitric oxide
(NO), a vasoprotective molecule that will vasodilate the freshly angioplastied artery, thereby combating elastic
recoil. The custom-formed stent will also promote long-term vascular healing by simultaneously inhibiting
neointimal hyperplasia and platelet adhesion, and stimulating endothelial cell growth. The stent will have
mechanical properties specific for the pulsatile, compliant arterial system. Lastly, the stent will degrade over
time, leaving a healthy, prosthetic-free, polymer-free environment in its place. Thus, our hypothesis is that a
liquid-cast, NO-eluting, biodegradable stent will have a superior patency rate compared to
conventional metal stents following balloon angioplasty by inhibiting thrombosis and neointimal
hyperplasia, and stimulating re-endothelialization. Through our multidisciplinary team of investigators and
industry engineers, we have already demonstrated the feasibility of our project through preliminary data. It is
now time to focus on developing and optimizing the drug releasing capacity of the polymeric stent and
conducting the in vivo preclinical studies necessary to translate this technology to the clinical arena. Thus, the
specific aims of this project are: 1) Develop and optimize a NO-eluting, liquid-cast PDDC stent using
diazeniumdiolate and S-nitrosothiol chemistry; 2) Evaluate and tune the mechanical properties of the NO-
eluting, liquid-cast PDDC stent ex vivo; 3) Examine the safety and efficacy of the NO-eluting, liquid-cast PDDC
stent in vivo. Our novel approach challenges the existing paradigm for arterial stenting and will lead to a
radical departure in the treatment of atherosclerotic occlusive disease. Through our preliminary data, we have
demonstrated the feasibility of this project. Given the burden of atherosclerotic disease in the veteran
population, the studies in this proposal will result in a new technology that will be translated to improved
veteran health."

 One of the most significant problems in the field of HIV deals with addressing the low rates of HIV care
among individuals living with HIV/AIDS, especially among Black/African American and Latinx communities.
This application seeks to study a novel way to address that problem by adopting and applying a cutting-edge
“big data outreach” approach being used to increase consumer engagement by top technologies companies.
This approach has recently been replacing other digital outreach methods largely for privacy reasons-- to
conform to stringent European Union privacy laws-- as it involves de-identified data.
 The digital outreach method being proposed is already being applied in health (but not yet HIV) settings.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, our team and others (including the CDC) studied and found success applying
these methods for targeted digital recruitment and outreach to those at high-risk for COVID-19. As a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on use of digital/remote tools, these approaches will soon be applied to
HIV to assist in targeting and engaging hard-to reach individuals in HIV research and care.
 Importantly, the proposed methods allow access to large-scale passively-collected, opt-in, community and
mobility (GPS pings) data, which have been shown to add rich and granular data to improve health
surveillance and interventions. This application seeks to use these novel digital outreach methods to identify
and enroll individuals living with HIV/AIDS from communities of color who are at high-risk for being out of care,
and analyze their mobility and community data to identify the key geographic contexts that impact HIV care
engagement. We are conducting this effort for, and in partnership with, 2 Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE)
jurisdictions (Washington D.C. and Orange County health departments) and key participant stakeholders to
gain their insights on needs, implementation (including ethical concerns), and potential future scale-up of this
approach to improve surveillance and intervention efforts. Specifically, we seek to 1) Identify individuals of
color living with HIV/AIDS within EHE regions who are at high-risk for being out of care, 2) Using GPS mobility,
community (e.g., local crime), and HIV care data, identify the key geographic contexts that impact HIV care
engagement, and 3) In partnership with the Washington D.C. and Orange County health departments, explore
a case study of the ongoing barriers and facilitators of this approach at the individual, interpersonal, and
structural levels.
 This 1-year cohort study will be focused on identifying people living within an EHE region who have been
hard-to-reach for HIV care in order to converge with EHE outcome measures. To our knowledge, this is the
first study to apply these novel “big data outreach” methods to HIV, will enroll the largest cohort to date with
GPS mobility, community, and other HIV care contextual data, and the first HIV study to passively collect
mobility data, which helps to increase data quality and reduce dropout rates compared to previous studies."
10881775,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor, found in the pediatric
population and often leads to death due to tumor progression and metastasis. Despite
intensive, multimodality treatment protocols with cytotoxic chemotherapy and aggressive
surgery, 30-40% of patients still succumb to relapsed and metastatic disease. Current
treatment options for these patients are extremely limited. More importantly, the clinical
outcome for OS patients has not improved at all during the last four decades. Our long-range
goals are to reduce OS disease burden and improve long-term survival by developing
molecular-based therapies that target mechanisms of tumor growth and metastasis. The F-box
protein s-phase kinase-associated protein-2 (Skp2) is the substrate recognition component of
the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box (SCF) complex and considered a key oncogene through its ability to
target cell cycle regulators for ubiquitin degradation, regulates cell migration and metastasis.
Skp2 interacts with the accessory protein Cks1 to ubiquitinate p27 for degradation, thus
promoting cell cycle progression and cancer growth. Currently, the oncogenic mechanisms
and therapeutic potential of Skp2 in OS is largely unknown. There are specific and rational
reasons for targeting the SCF-Skp2 axis in OS, based upon preliminary data generated by the
PI and his colleagues: (1) A high Skp2 expression in OS tissues portends a poor prognosis in
patients; (2) High levels of Skp2 are observed in many OS cell types, including established cell
lines, patient-derived xenografts, and primary cultures from OS patients; (3) Skp2 deletion
effectively blocks pituitary and prostate tumorigenesis in Rb1/p53-deficient mouse models. In
OS, genomic sequencing studies reveal a high rate of Rb1/p53 co-inactivation, suggesting that
OS may be susceptible to Skp2 blockade; (4) Genetic and drug-induced depletion of Skp2
reduces the proliferation and invasion of OS cell lines and; (5) Mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEF) and OS tumor cells with Rb1/p53 deletion are more sensitive to SCF-Skp2 inhibition
than wild-type and Skp2-deleted cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the SCF-Skp2
complex may offer a unique therapeutic opportunity for treating a tremendously challenging
cancer such as OS. We hypothesize that blockade of the SCF-Skp2 complex in the context of
Rb1/p53 inactivation will reduce OS progression. This hypothesis will be addressed by the
following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (Oncogenic Mechanisms): To define the pro-oncogenic
mechanisms of SCF-Skp2 in Rb1/p53-inactivated OS. Specific Aim 2 (Translational
Therapeutics): To determine the effect of inhibiting SCF-Skp2 in preclinical models of Rb1/p53-
inactivated OS. Finally, since cancer organoids represent an emerging technology that
faithfully replicates the tumor's genetic landscape, we will examine the effect of inhibiting SCF-
Skp2 in mouse OS organoids as a proof-of-concept to translate findings into patient-specific
therapeutics in the future. The successful completion of this study will be translatable to target
the SCF-Skp2 complex to block osteosarcoma progression."

Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. Approved stroke therapies are limited by narrow
treatment windows, the risk of hemorrhagic transformation, and reperfusion injury. Therefore, there is a critical
need for neuroprotective drugs that can improve post-stroke neurological performance. Currently, 3-hydroxy-3-
methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (i.e., statins) are given to stroke patients due to their
proven utility in improving cognitive and motor outcomes. Studies in our laboratory have uncovered a specific
biological mechanism that enables statins to be effective drugs for stroke treatment: transport across the blood-
brain barrier (BBB) via the endogenous uptake transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide 1a4 (Oatp1a4).
We have shown, for the first time, that Oatp-mediated transport is required for atorvastatin to reduce cerebral
infarction volume and improve sensorimotor performance at 24 h following transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion (tMCAO). We also observed increased atorvastatin uptake in female rats subjected to tMCAO as
compared with their age-matched male counterparts; however, it is unknown if these differences in Oatp-
mediated transport at the BBB cause variations in atorvastatin’s ability to prevent stroke progression and/or
worsening of neurocognitive deficits in the acute/subacute period. Our goals are to assess the role of sex as a
biological variable on statin transport in the ischemic brain and to determine how these differences affect statin
efficacy as stroke therapeutics. The central hypotheses of this F31 application are i) that functional
expression of Oatp1a4 at the BBB is different in males as compared to females following tMCAO; and ii)
that statin neuroprotective properties and/or their effects on post-stroke neurological outcomes are
influenced by sex-dependent differences in BBB Oatp1a4 activity. Two aims will test these hypotheses:
Aim 1: Investigate sex-dependent differences in Oatp1a4-mediated transport of statins at the BBB in
stroke. We will perform our studies in male and female SD rats using the tMCAO model. Oatp1a4 localization
and protein expression will be assessed using confocal microscopy and western blotting, respectively. Blood-to-
brain transport of statins will be measured using in situ brain perfusion, a state-of-the-art methodology to study
drug transport at the BBB.
Aim 2: Evaluate sex-dependent differences in statin-associated neuroprotection and functional
neurological recovery in stroke. In tMCAO operated male and female SD rats, we will use confocal microscopy
and western blot analysis to examine molecular biomarkers associated with neuroprotection. We will also assess
motor and cognitive performance in tMCAO-animals using robust behavioral tests (i.e., rotarod analysis, Morris
Water Maze, Novel Object Recognition test).
Overall, this project will provide critical mechanistic data on efficacy of statins as neuroprotective drugs for stroke.
Furthermore, this project directly aligns with NIH goals in studying sex as a biological variable in stroke."
10888857,"Candida glabrata is the second most common cause of candidemia. Many studies have found
that patients with C. glabrata bloodstream infection have higher mortality than those infected
with other Candida spp. One potential cause of this increased mortality is the relative ease with
which C. glabrata can acquire resistance to antifungal agents, including the major antifungal
drug fluconazole (FLC). In vitro studies with a limited number of clinical isolates have led to the
conclusion that that C. glabrata develops FLC resistance by one of two mechanisms, petite
mutants with mitochondrial defects or gain-of-function mutations in the Pdr1 transcription factor,
which result in overexpression of genes encoding drug efflux pumps. These conclusions are
based on the analysis of a relatively small number of C. glabrata isolates that were performed in
vitro. We analyzed 19 different C. glabrata clinical isolates with elevated FLC minimal inhibitory
concentrations (MICs) by whole genome sequencing and Western blotting for proteins involved
in FLC resistance. While a majority of these strains do contain alterations in their PDR1
sequence, most of these mutations have not been associated with FLC resistance previously.
Additionally, we found 4 unrelated strains with changes in ERG11, and 3 of these strains had
the same mutation, strongly suggesting that mutations in this gene may also reduce FLC
susceptibility. We also analyzed the transcriptional response of C. glabrata to FLC in the mouse
model of disseminated infection and found that the organism responds significantly different to
this drug during mammalian infection relative to growth in vitro. We will explore these compelling
data by 1) performing functional analysis of the genomes of clinical C. glabrata isolates with
elevated FLC MICs, and 2) analyzing the effects of FLC treatment on the C. glabrata
transcriptome during mammalian infection. Successful completion of these two aims will
important new insight into the molecular basis of FLC resistance in C. glabrata as it infects the
mammalian host. This information will serve as the basis for developing new strategies to
combat antifungal resistance in this increasingly prevalent pathogen."
10890591,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US, with over 135,000 deaths in 2020. A
screening test known as low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) can detect lung cancer early and reduce lung
cancer deaths among individuals with a history of heavy smoking, but this test requires patients and their
doctors to consider potential benefits and harms that differ according to each patient’s individual risk profile.
Due in part to the complexity of calculating and considering such patient-specific risk profiles in busy clinical
settings, less than 5% of eligible patients receive the screening every year. To address this urgent need, we
have developed a tool known as Decision Precision+ that analyzes patients’ electronic health records (EHRs),
prompts doctors to consider lung cancer screening for eligible patients, and provides doctors with individually-
tailored information on the potential benefits and harms of lung cancer screening. In doing so, Decision
Precision+ helps patients and their doctors make informed, patient-centered decisions regarding this
potentially life-saving test. Decision Precision+ has been in clinical use at University of Utah Health since 2020,
and the rate of lung cancer screening among eligible patients has increased dramatically. So as to help other
health systems increase their rates of appropriate lung cancer screening, Decision Precision+ is being made
available to other organizations as a free tool that can be downloaded and used with their own EHR systems.
This project will build upon this promising work in three ways. First, we will build a version of the tool that
integrates with the patient portal and can be used directly by patients. We will call this patient-centered tool
MyLungHealth. Doctors and health systems will be able to “prescribe” MyLungHealth to eligible patients, so
that they can make sure their smoking profile in the EHR is accurate and can learn about whether lung cancer
is right for them from the comfort of their own homes. Second, we will introduce MyLungHealth to primary care
practices at the University of Utah and New York University and rigorously study how much added benefit
MyLungHealth provides in clinical settings that already have access to Decision Precision+. Finally, we will
study how best to help other health systems implement these tools, and we will develop self-service resources
to help with implementation. In these ways, we will seek to help make sure that as many patients as possible
can benefit from appropriate lung cancer screening and the associated reduction in lung cancer deaths."
10890592,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
More than 1.5 million Americans are currently living with colorectal cancer (CRC). Improving CRC survivorship
is a high priority. Diet is an important factor influencing CRC prognosis. The use of dietary modification to
supplement conventional cancer therapy is an eminently practical approach. Growing data indicate the anti-
cancer benefit of coffee consumption. In the US, 64% of adults drink coffee daily, with an average consumption
of 2.7 cups per day. Coffee contains hundreds of antioxidants and other bioactive compounds, which are
degraded and modified by the gut microbiota and endogenous enzymes to generate secondary metabolites.
These metabolites may protect against CRC by reduction of inflammation, modulation of metabolism, and
inhibition of tumor growth and invasion. In particular, compelling data indicate the benefit of coffee for reducing
risk of fatty liver and liver fibrosis, conditions that have been linked to worse survival of CRC, possibly by
promotion of liver metastasis, the major cause of CRC death. Recently, we showed in four independent
prospective cohorts that CRC patients consuming 4 cups/d or more of coffee had a 40-50% lower risk of
recurrence and CRC-specific death compared with nondrinkers. However, the causality and specific
mechanisms for this relationship remain unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to conduct a
biomarker-based randomized placebo-controlled trial and assess the prognostic influence of the interplay
between coffee intake and the metabolomic and microbial signatures in patients with stage III CRC. We
hypothesize that compounds in coffee and their metabolites improve CRC survival by modulating the gut
microbiome and ameliorating liver fatness and fibrosis. In Aim 1, we will determine the effect of coffee
consumption on the gut microbiome and metabolome, liver fatness and fibrosis, and markers of CRC recurrence
in a randomized controlled trial of freeze-dried instant coffee and placebos for 3 months among 80 stage III
colon cancer patients who have completed chemotherapy. In Aim 2, we will prospectively assess coffee intake,
fecal microbial features and metabolites in relation to CRC recurrence and survival in a cohort of 450 stage III
CRC patients who provide detailed dietary data and stool specimens. Our ability to accomplish these aims is
underscored by our experience with dietary intervention and biobanking studies in CRC; our multi’omic profiling
effort to elucidate the interplay between diet, the gut microbiome, and host metabolism in CRC; as well as our
experienced multidisciplinary team comprised of experts in nutrition, microbiome, epidemiology, oncology, and
hepatology. The mechanistic insights provided by the project will not only help refine the recommendations for
cancer survivorship for one of the most commonly consumed beverages worldwide, but also lead to discovery
of novel adjuvant therapeutics and development of novel interventions based on manipulation of the diet,
metabolome, and microbiome for improved CRC management."

 Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect 5.6 million Americans at an annual cost of $157
billion. Three million Americans have late-stage ADRD with suffering caused by progressive dependency and
distressing symptoms. Family caregivers experience extraordinary physical, emotional and financial strain.
 Hospitalizations for acute illnesses are common in late-stage ADRD, with worsened symptoms and
distressing decisions about goals of care and intensive treatments. Hospitalizations also present a unique
opportunity for dementia-specific palliative care to address suffering and reduce burdensome treatments, since
72% of hospitals have palliative care teams. Palliative care improves symptom control and quality of life in
serious illnesses, but has never been adapted and tested for the unique needs of late-stage ADRD.
We therefore developed the ADRD Palliative Care (ADRD-PC) program. Using a novel rapid screening
system, we randomized 62 dyads of hospitalized patients with late-stage ADRD and their family caregivers to
the ADRD-PC program vs education control. Intervention dyads received i) dementia-specific palliative care, ii)
standardized caregiver education, and iii) transitional care delivered by an interdisciplinary palliative care team;
control dyads received educational material on dementia caregiving. The ADRD-PC program was well-
accepted, and resulted in significant improvements in use of hospice, symptom management, caregiver
communication about prognosis and goals of care, new advance directives, and “Do Not Hospitalize” orders.
The necessary next step to advance the science of dementia-specific palliative care is an adequately powered
RCT of the efficacy of the ADRD-PC program to improve patient and family centered outcomes.
Our research objective is to conduct a multi-site efficacy RCT of the ADRD-PC program. We will enroll
424 dyads of hospitalized patients with late-stage ADRD and family caregivers at 4 geographically diverse
member sites of the Palliative Care Research Cooperative group. Our Specific Aims are:
Aim 1: To conduct a multi-site RCT of the ADRD-PC program of dementia-specific palliative and transitional
care (intervention arm) vs publicly available educational material for dementia caregivers (control arm) to
compare 60-day hospital transfers (hospitalization and emergency room visits) for persons with late-stage
ADRD (primary outcome).
Aim 2: To compare patient-centered secondary outcomes between intervention and control arms: a) symptom
treatment; b) symptom control; c) post-acute use of community palliative care or hospice; and d) new nursing
home transitions.
Aim 3: To compare caregiver-centered secondary outcomes between intervention and control arms: a)
communication about prognosis and goals of care; b) shared decision-making; and c) caregiver distress.
IMPACT: ADRD-PC has the potential to reduce suffering for millions of persons with late-stage ADRD."

Project Title: Maintenance of the Animal Feed Regulatory Program Standards and the Coordinated
Preventive Control Regulatory Activities and Capacity Building
Project Period: September 1, 2020 – February 16, 2022
Project Summary
The Animal Feed Regulatory Program Standards (AFRPS) establish a uniform foundation for the design
and management of State programs responsible for the regulation of animal feed. The Georgia
Department of Agriculture (GDA) will continue collaborative efforts for the advancement of an
integrated animal food safety system based on mutual reliance and shared responsibility with the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other state partners and stakeholders.
The overall objective of this project is full implementation of the AFRPS Maintenance Phase Track and
conducting regulatory work while promoting compliance with the Preventive Controls for Animal Food
(PCAF) regulation. Our overarching goal as a state regulatory authority is to reduce the risk-factors that
are known to cause or contribute to illnesses in animal and humans in firms that manufacture, process,
pack, or hold animal food materials.
Objectives for this project include the following: a) demonstrating the ability to develop and/or maintain
implementation of a comprehensive improvement plan that will results in full implementation of the
AFRPS and continued maintenance of the AFRPS; b) expanding the Auditing Program by moving toward
implementing Phase II audits and collecting audit data on full-scope PCAF inspections; c) demonstrating
the availability of adequately trained staff and the criteria and ability to hire and/or train personnel to
meet the goals and outputs of the cooperative agreement; d) providing a properly detailed budget that
is intended to achieve implementation and maintenance of the AFRPS; e) developing an outreach plan
and associated materials related to the PCAF regulation and compliance and other FSMA related rules as
part of GDA’s overall outreach plan; f) demonstrating the ability to fully participate in initiative
supporting the AFRPS, such as a required annual face-to-face meeting and any required training for this
project, committees, conference calls, sharing best practices, annual visits, and verification audits; and
g) meeting with FDA as necessary to develop/monitor working planning progress for dual inspected
facilities to advance information sharing, firm reconciliation, and enforcement action between Georgia
and FDA.
By achieving and maintaining implementation of these program Standards, GDA and FDA can better
direct their regulatory activities toward preventing animal food safety hazards that can cause illness or
injury to animal or humans in facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold animal food materials."

Epigenetic mechanisms have been linked to many human disorders and diseases, most notably cancer.
However, in recent years more and more human diseases have been found with possible epigenetic insults. In
this regard, our collaborators at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia have through exome sequencing
discovered germline-line mutations to the H3FA and H3FB genes in pediatric patients that suffer from similar
neurological disorders and craniofacial abnormalities. These two genes encode for the histone variant H3.3, and
thus represent the first germ-line mutations found on histone H3 in humans (neurohistone H3.3 mutations).
Histones are small basic proteins that bind DNA to give rise to our chromatin structure. Along with DNA
methylation and long non-coding RNA, post-translational modifications to histones regulate gene expression
patterns (epigenetic mechanisms) and chromatin organization. Histone H3.3 is a specialized histone variant
linked to active genes, and somatic mutations to this histone have been found in different brain cancers
exclusively on the N-terminal tail. Our preliminary data have found that these neurohistone H3.3 mutations are
spread across the entire protein from the N- to C-terminus. Therefore, we hypothesize that these mutations while
resulting in similar phenotypes, do this by disrupting different epigenetic mechanisms involving histone H3.3. In
this proposal, we aim to understand how these neurohistone mutations lead to neurodevelopmental problems.
First, we aim to determine if these neurohistone mutations affect global or local histone modification patterns on
wild-type or mutant histone variants using novel mass spectrometry (MS) approaches in cellular models. Next,
we look to determine if these neurohistone mutants affect chromatin structure or conformation, or cause
misincorporation of the H3.3 variant in the genome. Lastly, we will characterize proteome expression in a mouse
model of one of the mutations using a novel in utero stable isotope labeling approach. It is our goal to determine
how these neurohistone H3.3 mutations affect epigenetic and cellular signaling mechanisms to disrupt
neurodevelopment and maintenance leading to neurological disorders in these pediatric patients."

The Greater Boston MSTAR Program aims to provide a short-term aging research and mentoring experience to
medical students early in their career. Students will become educated and enthusiastic about the career
opportunities in academic, clinical, and research geriatric medicine. The Program has operated continuously since
1989 and provided short term research training experiences to over 230 medical students. Both the Program
Director and Co-Director have five years of experience in this role and have been involved with teaching and
mentoring Boston MSTAR students for over a decade. The Program Director will report to the Mentor Advisory
Council for program oversite, increasing the pool of high-quality mentors, and continued efforts on recruiting minority
Scholars from Harvard, the University of Mississippi/Jackson Heart Study, Boston University Medical Center, the
University of Massachusetts Medical School, and Brown University School of Medicine. We currently have over 40
mentors with more than 200 funded research projects whose combined direct costs for the current year total over
$60 million.
The heart of the Boston MSTAR Program will be the 8 to12-week mentored aging research project experience for
11 scholars: 7 from medical schools across the country, and one each from the University of Mississippi, University
of Massachusetts, Boston University Medical Center, and Brown University. All students will receive training in
protection of human subjects, aging research methodology, and clinical geriatrics. Students will present their
research in an oral presentation and will be strongly encouraged to present their work at the annual meeting of the
American Geriatrics Society. The program will track students through their medical training and career decisions. By
developing a strong relationship with the students, the scholar tracking will be a continuation of the mentoring
experience and a forum to increase scholar interest in aging research.
The program’s past successes are a foreshadowing of its future potential. Over the past grant cycle, we have tripled
the number of applicants, allowing us to select students with a genuine interest in aging research. Over two-thirds of
our students present at a scientific meeting 20% publish a scientific paper from their 8-12 week mentored research
experience. Long term, under the T35 mechanism, 24% of matriculated students have pursued additional research
training or a career in geriatrics. As a result, the Greater Boston MSTAR Program seeks to continue the tradition of
training medical students in aging research."
10890745,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Research mentoring relationships are one of the most important means by which students acquire core
research competencies, develop a strong sense of self-identity as a scientist, and prepare for careers.
However, practical training for students in how to initiate and navigate these critical relationships is absent from
most biomedical research training programs. In order to address this discrepancy in training, iBiology will
partner with the authors of ​Entering Research​ at the University of Wisconsin-Madison to build, test, and
evaluate a program of online instruction called “Navigating Research Mentoring Relationships.” This program
will focus on students at the critical undergraduate to graduate transition, i.e., advanced research
undergraduates and first year graduate students. “Navigating Research Mentoring Relationships” will provide
instruction that can be integrated into the curriculum of an existing research training program or engaged with
independently by students in programs that choose not to integrate it, as providing courses online allows the
training material to be accessible regardless of personal or institutional resources. This program will address
challenges that ​students ​from diverse backgrounds face as they transition from undergraduate to graduate
school by (1) teaching them to cultivate mentoring relationships with intentionality and to leverage those
relationships to benefit their education, research, and careers, (2) building a national community of students
from diverse institutions and backgrounds to support their collective learning/training, (3) providing access to
free evidence-based, in depth, just-in-time instruction in their research training, and (4) highlighting important
cultural aspects of responsible conduct of research, reproducibility, and equity and inclusion. The program has
four main aims. First, to develop the “Navigating Research Mentoring Relationships” online course content.
Second, to develop evidence-based strategies to promote student engagement and learning through online
communities. Third, to pilot test “Navigating Research Mentoring Relationships” with undergraduate and
graduate students from diverse backgrounds. And fourth, to revise and disseminate the online courses to the
public. The program will be evaluated using feedback from educational experts, as well as student testing of
the courses and online learning communities at various stages. Evaluation data will include online surveys of
students, course platform analytics, and pilot test site institutional data. The evaluation plan will allow for the
assessment of program outcomes and whether the desired objectives have been met. The evaluation data will
also allow for evidence-based revision and updating of the courses prior to release to the public, where the
courses will be available to biomedical research trainees of all levels. The intended outcomes of this project
are to build the critical interpersonal, communication, and collaboration skills students need to support positive
mentoring relationships and, therefore, increase their persistence in a biomedical research career pathway."

 Project Summary/Abstract
There are STEM opportunity gaps for a number of young children, including those with
disabilities and from underserved populations. The proposed project aims to address those
gaps and to increase access to high quality STEM learning opportunities for all young children.
By creating partnerships between researchers and practitioners, the project has the potential to
impact many young children and their caregivers who otherwise may not have had the
opportunity to engage in STEM learning.
The proposed science education partnership (SEP) consists of researchers and practitioners in
an informal learning space collaborating together in the co-development and implementation of
inclusive STEM playgroups for children with and without disabilities and their caregivers.
Researchers will support the practitioner team to collect and analyze preliminary efficacy data
relative to child-caregiver engagement, child STEM play skills, and caregiver feelings of self-
efficacy and confidence and competence related to embedding STEM learning, specifically
related to foundational computational thinking skills into their daily routines and activities. The
project will last for two years using a waitlist control design comparing groups receiving the
intervention to those who are on the waitlist. Both quantitative data and qualitative data will be
collected and analyzed in order to assess playgroup preliminary efficacy and preliminary
changes in caregiver perceptions following playgroup participation. Qualitative data will
additionally be used for ongoing modifications and adaptations of the playgroup model and
materials to ensure that they are useful and relevant to caregivers and children who are
participating in them.
The findings and products from the proposed project could inform future inclusive STEM
playgroups both in informal learning spaces and beyond and will be freely available on the
partners’ websites. Overall, the project has the potential to lessen the STEM opportunity gaps
that exist for many children and caregivers."
10888660,"The lung-resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) are the initial host cells infected by inhaled
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). While traditionally perceived as a conducive environment for Mtb replication
and spread, our recent studies using fluorescent Mtb fitness reporter strains and single-cell RNA-sequencing
(scRNA-seq) have revealed a more intricate reality.
 We discovered two primary AM populations in the Mtb-infected lung: SiglecF+ CD38+ pro-inflammatory
AMs, which house stressed bacteria and express high levels of Nos2, and SiglecF+ CD38- AMs, which lack Nos2
expression and accommodate replicative bacteria.
 Intriguingly, our preliminary findings indicate that CD38- AMs, which exhibit limited Mtb containment
capabilities, are the predominant infected AM population during the early infection stages. Moreover, intranasal
BCG vaccination prior to Mtb exposure significantly reduces the number of Mtb-infected host cells and markedly
increases the proportion of CD38+ infected AMs. This suggests a critical role for the CD38+ AM phenotype in
triggering a protective immune response following vaccination.
 Although these AM subsets appear transcriptionally indistinguishable in naive mice, they demonstrate
distinct chromatin organization, suggesting that epigenetic factors dictate their response to infection.
Our hypothesis is that a higher prevalence of CD38+ AMs within the lung airways leads to improved early
inhibition of Mtb proliferation and spread, thereby unveiling a viable avenue for immune mediate control
of tuberculosis infection.
Specific Aim 1: Elucidate the host molecular mechanisms contributing to the limited response of CD38-
AMs to Mtb infection.
To decipher the host molecular mechanisms underlying the blunted response of CD38- AMs to Mtb infection, we
will employ an integrated multi-omics approach to analyze the changes in chromatin organization and
transcription factor activity post-Mtb infection. We will then manipulate the AM immune environment through
intranasal BCG vaccination to identify those epigenetic changes that are associated with long-term protection
against Mtb infection.
Specific Aim 2: Implement CRISPR-based genetic perturbation approaches in macrophages to evaluate
the role of selected host responses in Mtb infection.
Initially, we will use a CRISPR-based genetic perturbation approach to validate the role of candidate host genes,
identified in our existing datasets, in generating pro-inflammatory macrophage responses that control Mtb
infection. We will then extend this approach to functionally validate additional targets emerging from Specific
Aim 1."
10888659,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neuroscience research has historically relied on observing tightly controlled behaviors in siloed laboratory
experiments, constraining our understanding of the neural bases of complex behaviors observed in naturalistic
settings. With ongoing advances in unobtrusive sensing technology, artificial intelligence, and machine learning
(AI/ML), and availability of computing power, the field of neuroscience has been afforded an opportunity to make
large-scale discoveries hitherto unimaginable. For this to be realized, however, it is crucial to facilitate secondary
analyses that cut across individual datasets, allowing for research that transcends individual project designs.
Such a goal cannot be achieved without a data archive that provides a compelling technical solution for storing
and curating datasets, and that provides close integration with analytical resources that require minimal technical
expertise to be leveraged.
Here, we propose the Ecosystem for Multi-modal Brain-behavior Experimentation and Research (EMBER), a
data archive specifically tailored to serve the unique needs of the Brain Behavior Quantification and
Synchronization (BBQS) research community, which will be at the forefront of advancing neurobehavioral
knowledge in coming years. At the heart of EMBER is a scalable, hybrid data archive which will house and
manage multimodal and multi-species data collected by diverse research groups. Crucially, our hybrid
architecture will not only automatically execute the optimal storage scheme for different modalities of data,
leveraging existing BRAIN Informatics resources, but also achieve dual objectives of ensuring the security of
behavioral and environmental data — which may include Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) — as well as expediting querying and data access not only within BBQS datasets
but also with other BRAIN resources. Different cadres of EMBER users, such as BBQS data generators,
analysts, as well as the broader neuroscience community will be able to ingest, curate, and instigate discovery
from data using a user-friendly portal that will streamline highly technical data harmonization and synchronization
steps. In particular, development, testing, and deployment of analysis tools will be supported by cloud-based
sandboxes that are seamlessly integrated with ML/AI resources developed by the BBQS Data Coordination and
Artificial Intelligence Center (DCAIC).
Integral to EMBER’s success will be acceptance in the community as the gold-standard engine for discovery,
providing utility beyond being simply a passive, program-mandated data archive. Throughout its lifecycle, we will
nurture bidirectional collaboration with the data generators, analysts, as well as the broader neuroscience
research community to introduce and maintain tools for sharing, querying, and analyzing data. We anticipate
that EMBER and associated data resources will maximize the BBQS program’s potential to reach its ambitious
objectives of transforming our understanding of the link between brain and behavior."
10891402,"Project Summary:
The Integrated Pathology and Genomics Core provides state-of-the-art analytic services for lung cancer samples
spanning the full spectrum from initial sample handling and processing, to microscopic analysis by certified
anatomic pathologists, to immunophenotypic analysis, to molecular genetic and genomic analysis. This work
constitutes the backbone of lung cancer management, and enables the diagnosis and proper treatment selection
for patients with lung cancers of all types, and also enables research into cancer biology, etiology, and
management. Our pathology core has supported work that has led to major advances in the understanding of
lung cancer biology, and associated management thereof, including seminal discoveries of the importance of
mutations in EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and MET in lung cancer, the diagnosis and management of which have become
the international standard-of-care in this area of medicine. In the same manner, we intend to continue our work
to advance the understanding and care of lung cancer, by supporting the new projects proposed herein, with a
combination of standard-of-care and innovative new cutting-edge technologies.
In this SPORE proposal, we will support each of the proposed projects with a combination of standard-of-care
clinical pathology services - such as histologic characterization of tumors, immunohistochemical assessment of
protein expression, and massively parallel sequencing of tumor DNA - and innovative new techniques. Among
the innovative new techniques to be deployed for this project are customized allele-specific PCR assays for
individual fusion transcripts to enable ultrasensitive monitoring of cell-free circulating ALK rearrangements in
plasma samples, cyclic immunofluorescence and transcriptomics for simultaneous in situ spatial expression of
multiple proteins and transcripts involved in various biochemical pathways, and multiplexed ion beam imaging
to provide high-order assessment of immune cell infiltrates within and adjacent to cancers."
10891404,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The DF/HCC Lung SPORE Developmental Research Program (DRP) is essential to the growth and future
success of our SPORE program because it is a mechanism to advance high quality, innovative lung cancer
research proposals from the pilot stage to full-fledged expanded projects, including future SPORE projects. We
will leverage the DRP to create opportunities for research development of a diverse range of both junior faculty
and senior investigators with an interest in lung cancer and to stimulate new research ideas and new
collaborations. Both basic science and translational projects will be considered, and we have a robust plan to
encourage and promote proposal submission by researchers from underrepresented minority groups, diverse
specialties and from women.
The DRP will initiate a broad call for proposals that will be circulated widely through the help of our faculty, our
Governance Committee, and our Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Committee to ensure the most promising early-
phase research projects receive meritorious funding. Investigators at all DF/HCC member institutions will be
eligible to submit applications, in addition to some partner institutions throughout Boston. Applications will
undergo a formal standardized review process, with a large scientifically-diverse committee of reviewers, to
assess scientific merit, potential impact, the applicant’s credentials, and likelihood of success and progression
to independent funding. Awards are intended to be two years in duration, but each project will be reviewed at
the one-year mark to ensure that reasonable progress is being made prior to the second year of funding.
Recipients of DRP funding will participate consistently in the SPORE program with posters and/or presentations
at the Annual Lung Cancer Retreat, and regular mentoring by the DRP leadership. We have secured significant
institutional funding to supplement Federal funds, allowing multiple DRP awardees per year and allowing each
awardee to be supported for up to two years. The DF/HCC has a large and talented investigator group to provide
a wealth of applications from which to choose, and we anticipate a robust response to each request for
applications that is announced."

10891417,"Project Summary—Cancer Research Career Enhancement
The Mays Cancer Center (MCC) Cancer Research Career Enhancement (CRCE) Core seeks to provide a
continuous supply of well-trained cancer scientists performing state-of-the-art cancer research. The Core is led
by Robin Leach, Ph.D., (PSP) Associate Director (AD) for Education and a member of the Cancer Center since
its inception. The UT Health San Antonio (UT Health SA) is the largest academic Health Science Center for
South Texas and includes Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Dentistry, Health Professions, and the Graduate School
of Biomedical Sciences. The UT Health SA is designated by the U.S. Department of Education as a Hispanic-
serving Institution and consistently ranks as one of the top schools in the U.S. for graduating Hispanic health
care providers.
The MCC at the UT Health SA places a high priority on education and mentoring, and does so both within the
Cancer Center and by integrating and coordinating activities with existing programs at UT Health SA. The MCC
has dedicated resources to cancer-related training and career development from high schoolers through early-
stage faculty levels. During the last reporting period, the MCC has provided cancer research training for 51 high
school students and 155 undergraduates in summer enrichment and training programs. MCC members have
trained 115 M.S. and 147 Ph.D. level graduate students, 30 medical students (via an accredited medical school
research electives course), 25 M.D./Ph.D. students, and 2 D.D.S./Ph.D. students. A total of 70 physicians have
completed MCC’s fellowships in Hematology and Medical Oncology, Advanced Oncology Drug Development,

CRCE Core has augmented cancer-related research mentoring for early-stage faculty who are Associate
Members of MCC, partnering the basic scientists with senior clinical faculty and the clinical scientists with senior
basic science faculty. During the upcoming funding period, the Core will continue summer training in cancer
research for high school through college students, and develop new training opportunities for middle school
students. Importantly, most of these efforts will target opportunities for underrepresented populations. We will
also leverage and expand the existing cancer-related education and training activities throughout UT Health SA.
We will continue to support mentoring and career development among advanced trainees – from fellows through
early-stage faculty – with an emphasis on fostering participation of underserved minorities to produce a more
diverse cancer research workforce of the future."

related publications during the last reporting period. In 2018, the BBSR worked with 30 MCC members with
peer-reviewed cancer-related funding, 45% of the total number of users. BBSR usage is anticipated to grow with
expanding proteomic profiling and high-throughput sequencing and screening techniques. New instruments in
the NGSSR for single-cell data analysis, adoption of data-independent acquisition methods in the MSSR, and
more MCC members using CRISPR pooled screening techniques will offer new opportunities to collaborate
across the Shared Resources. Use of biostatistical services is also expected to increase by about 5% per year
based on requests from 2014-2018 and new services offered."
10891425,"Project Summary—Mass Spectrometry Shared Resource
The purpose of the Mass Spectrometry Shared Resource (MSSR) is to provide the Mays Cancer Center (MCC)
members and University of Texas Health San Antonio (UT Health SA) investigators with comprehensive, state-
of-the-art support for characterization and quantification of proteins, metabolites and other biomedically important
molecules using mass spectrometry. The MSSR has been a Cancer Center Shared Resource since 1998 and
is housed in 1,034 sq. ft. of space in two laboratories on the Long (main) campus of the UT Health SA. The
MSSR is jointly managed by the UT Health SA and the MCC. Proteomics is the main focus of the MSSR,
providing a wide range of services that include molecular mass determination, protein identification and relative
quantification, and identification/localization of sites of protein modification. The scope of its service has
expanded significantly over the years with the acquisition of new equipment supported by numerous NIH

for Mass Spectrometry. The MSSR team has exceptional expertise in the use of mass spectrometry to solve
important cancer-related questions. During the last funding period, the MSSR serviced 31 peer-review funded
MCC members. Its annual usage by peer-review funded MCC members averaged 27%."
10891428,"Project Summary—Drug Discovery and Structural Biology Shared Resource
The Drug Discovery and Structural Biology Shared Resource (DDSB) is a new Mays Cancer Center (MCC)-
supported Shared Resource that combines comprehensive services to better meet the needs of MCC users.
The purpose of the DDSB is to provide state-of-the-art capabilities to MCC investigators for the study of cancer-
related macromolecules at the atomic and molecular levels, how they interact with other macromolecules such
as ligands, and for identification of small molecules that can target them using advanced tools such as X-ray
crystallography, nuclear magnetic (NMR) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and high-throughput screening
(HTS) technologies – including, but not limited to, cell-based phenotypic high-content imaging-based and purified
component-based HTS. The DDSB makes critical contributions to the MCC’s overarching mission to end cancer
by providing a comprehensive platform that integrates structural biology, molecular phenotypes, and drug
discovery to expand knowledge on the etiology of cancer, discover cancer-relevant targets, and identify potential
therapeutics. The DDSB is composed of four integrated modules: (a) Small Molecule Probe and Drug Discovery,
(b) NMR, (c) X-ray Crystallography, and (d) Macromolecular Interactions. Each module is led by an expert in
that field, with oversight of all modules provided by Matthew Hart, Ph.D. Depending on the project, DDSB can
perform focused studies involving one or more modules, or perform integrative studies involving all modules.
During the last reporting period (2014-2018), the DDSB worked with 40 MCC members who used 53% of total
service time. In this period, the DDSB supported 20 cancer-related publications. DDSB activities also generated
a pipeline of 10 lead compounds in the structure-guided optimization stage and 18 early-stage projects, ~50%
of which are expected to reach lead optimization within two years. At the end of the next funding period we
expect to have delivered 5-8 new vetted leads, ready to move into preclinical stages, to cancer investigators. To
further its goals, the DDSB will establish advanced novel tools for X-ray crystallography, high-throughput
screening (including approaches that target heretofore “undruggable” targets), and directed cancer-related target
degradation. During the next funding period, we expect the DDSB to continue advancing our understanding of
mechanisms that drive cancers and identifying novel cancer therapeutics to be tested for future clinical use. The
DDSB unites multiple capabilities challenging for individual investigators to pursue because of the cost, required
maintenance of the instrumentation, and breadth of expertise needed to use these technologies. Thus, the DDSB
is essential for the MCC to achieve its strategic goal of translating a molecular understanding of the processes
that underlie cancer into novel therapies."
10891431,"Project Summary—Next Generation Sequencing Shared Resource
The mission of the Next-Generation Sequencing Shared Resource (NGSSR) is to provide Mays Cancer Center
(MCC) members with state-of-the-art next generation sequencing technology for detecting and exploring
alterations in nucleotide sequence, DNA copy number variation, gene expression differences, chromosome
structure variation, chromatin modification and all interactions which are linked to the complexity of phenotypes
seen in cancers. The NGSSR, directed by Zhao Lai, Ph.D., has been an MCC Shared Resource since 2012.
It is located in 1,000 sq. ft. of space in the Greehey Children’s Cancer Research Institute (GCCRI) building,
adjacent to the MCC. Dr. Lai is assisted by technical director Ms. Dawn Garcia. The NGSSR conducts
sequence applications for MCC users across all 3 scientific programs. Services include various types of library
construction, DNA-seq, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, small RNA-seq and exomeCap-seq, CRISPR screening, 16S
metagenomics, and single cell analysis. In addition, Dr. Lai and the NGSSR team assist users with experimental
design and provide educational training to faculty, staff and students. The NGSSR works closely with the
Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource (BBSR), led by Yidong Chen, Ph.D. (PSP), a bioinformatics
expert. The BBSR works with the NGSSR to provide MCC members with computational capabilities that
complement the NGSSR’s offerings. The NGSSR is overseen by a Scientific Advisory Committee and the MCC
Shared Resource Oversight Committee (SROC). In 2018, the NGSSR was used by 31 peer-reviewed funded
MCC members (36% of total usage) and contributed to 12 cancer-related manuscripts in 2018. Since its
inception, from 2014 to the middle of 2018, NGSSR has quickly become an essential component in MCC and
transformed the genomics research environment for MCC members with a nearly three-fold increase in the
number of users and contributions to over 44 cancer-related publications in NEJM, Nature, Cancer Cell, PNAS,
and other high-impact peer-reviewed journals. As new tools and reagents are developed (e.g. liquid biopsies)
they can be readily implemented in NGS assays. Another exciting area of cancer research is single-cell analysis.
The NGSSR will be heavily involved in strategic planning and design of these experiments. The NGSSR has
improved efficiency, created a smooth data pipeline incorporating analyses, and acquired new hardware through
multiple funding sources to upgrade its equipment. It continues to provide essential cutting-edge, high-quality,
and cost-effective services to MCC users across all 3 scientific programs."
10891434,"Project Summary-Cancer Development and Progression (CDP) Program

D.Phil. and Ratna K. Vadlamudi, Ph.D. are Co-Leaders of the Program. The CDP Program focuses on
laboratory-based studies of fundamental problems in cancer etiology and progression and also clinical translation
of our research findings. The Program has two thematic areas: 1) Genomic Repair and Epigenetics and 2) Tumor
Microenvironment. Through these foci, the CDP Program continues to make important contributions toward the
MCC’s goal of cancer prevention and treatment, particularly for those disproportionate in our largely Hispanic
population in South Texas. The Program’s Specific Aims are to: 1) Pursue basic and translational research to
discover cancer-specific genome alterations, DNA repair mechanisms, and epigenetic programming that can be
effectively translated to the clinic; and 2) Discover mechanisms and identify new therapeutic targets for
modulating tumor metastases, paracrine signaling, immune signaling, and metabolism. The CDP Program has
29 members. They represent eight different academic departments in the Long School of Medicine at UT Health
SA, and one member is from the University of Texas at Austin. CDP Program members hold $11.7M in peer-
reviewed cancer-related funding (47 grants; direct costs). NCI provides $1.7M in funding (through 12 grants).
Over the last reporting period, CDP Program members have published 260 peer-reviewed papers. Of these,
26% were products of intra-programmatic collaborations, 21% of inter-programmatic collaborations, and 77%
involved multi-institutional collaborations, including 84 (42%) publications with other NCI-designated Cancer
Centers. CDP members continue to use Cancer Center-supported cores extensively in their research, most
notably, Next Generation Sequencing, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Mass Spectrometry, Flow Cytometry,
and Drug Discovery and Structural Biology facilities. CDP scientific accomplishments over the past five years
have resulted in several paradigm-shifting findings, high-impact publications (e.g. Nature, Cell, Molecular Cell,
Nature Communications), development of novel models for defining cancer development and progression
mechanisms, an antibody-based therapeutic for metastatic breast cancer, new estrogen receptor-beta agonists
for enhancing tumor suppression, and small molecule inhibitors for treating endocrine therapy resistance. CDP
members –including successful new recruits whose work expands our program’s focus – work closely with the
Experimental and Developmental Therapeutics (EDT) Program to move research into the clinic. Multiple grants
are already underway to pursue these hypotheses, with others in review and planned for upcoming submissions.
In the last reporting period, two clinical trials have begun to translate CDP findings: one testing S-equol in breast
cancer (NCT02352025), and one testing imipramine in triple-negative breast cancer (NCT03122444)."
10891436,"Project Summary—Experimental and Developmental Therapeutics (EDT) Program
The Experimental and Developmental Therapeutics (EDT) Program is one of three interactive research programs
of the Mays Cancer Center (MCC) at the University of Texas Health San Antonio (UT Health SA). Andrew
Brenner, M.D., Ph.D. and Manjeet Rao, Ph.D. serve as Co-Leaders of the EDT Program. The primary focus of
the EDT Program is to improve treatment of cancer through basic, translational, and clinical research. The EDT
Program is the hub for clinical development of discoveries made by all members of MCC. The EDT Program
members have expertise spanning experimental and developmental therapeutics – from initial target discovery,
to IND regulatory approval, to early-phase clinical trials. The EDT Program members pursue this research
focused on three major themes: 1) Neuro-oncology; 2) Immuno-oncology; and 3) Drug repurposing. In addition
to these major themes, the EDT Program has one emerging theme: Targeted therapeutics. EDT members will
advance the translational potential within these themes through the following Specific Aims: 1) Discovery of
novel targets; 2) Development of new therapeutic agents and approaches; and 3) Conduct of early-phase clinical
trials of novel therapies. The EDT Program currently has 36 members, representing 13 departments within three
schools (Medical, Dental and Graduate) at UT Health SA. Two members are from the University of Texas at
Austin and one member from Texas State University. Fifteen members lead clinical trials. The EDT Program
members have $5.7M of peer-reviewed cancer-related funding (27 grants). Of those, $2.7M are from 15 NCI
grants. From January 2014 to June 2019, EDT Program members coauthored 414 peer-reviewed cancer-related
publications, 24% were from intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% were from inter-programmatic
collaborations. In addition, 79% of these publications involve multi-institutional collaborations, including 192
(46%) publications with other NCI-designated Cancer Centers. EDT members use all of the MCC-supported
Shared Resources to pursue their cross-cutting research, especially the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Mass
Spectrometry, Drug Discovery and Structural Biology facilities. EDT members have also led 130 interventional
clinical trials, and in 2018 alone, 226 patients were accrued to intervention trials."
10891438,"Project Summary--Population Science and Prevention (PSP) Program
The Population Science and Prevention (PSP) Program, co-led by Pratap Kumar, Ph.D. and Gail Tomlinson,
M.D., Ph.D., has 29 members, representing 4 schools and 10 departments at the Mays Cancer Center (MCC)
at the University of Texas Health San Antonio (UT Health SA). The primary focus of the PSP Program is
collaborative research that addresses cancer risk and prevention to develop intervention strategies. Studies are
focused on our overarching goal of reducing cancer burden in our 38-county catchment area. Our emphasis has
been on improving cancer screening and detection, improving access to care, and translation prevention
discoveries through interventional trials. These include behavioral interventions to improve cancer outcomes,
incorporating community outreach and engagement of underserved populations. PSP members have: 1)
Formulated a panel of patented biomarkers for predicting recurrent risk of prostate cancer; 2) Identified
epigenotypes for stratifying an endometrial cancer subtype predominantly occurring in young, obese Hispanics;
and 3) Shown that exposure to aflatoxin and hepatitis C virus may cause hepatocellular carcinoma in our
catchment area and other Hispanic populations. Inter- and intra-programmatic efforts have found that: 1) Yoga-
based exercise and nutritional interventions can reduce circulating inflammatory cytokines, thereby enhancing
survival of breast cancer patients; and 2) Texting and mobile media services help Hispanic adolescent/young
adults (AYAs) quit smoking in a cost-effective manner. Through our collaborative work, we have impacted the
population across our geographic area (including rural and border regions): e.g. increased identification rates of
those carrying hepatitis C, and increased HPV vaccine administration, genetic risk assessment and testing, and
enhanced cancer screening in genetically at-risk populations. In the upcoming Cancer Center Support Grant
(CCSG) cycle, we continue to address the disproportionate burden of cancer across the age continuum –
children, AYAs, and adults – in our catchment area. Our Program’s Specific Aims are to: 1) Discover biomarkers
to enhance early detection and recurrent prediction; 2) Translate evidence-based chemotherapeutic/
nutritional/behavioral strategies to interventional trials; and 3) Enhance quality of life for cancer survivors. These
Specific Aims will be achieved by promoting intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations to translate findings
into clinical interventions to benefit our population. PSP Program members hold 28 grants totaling $5.7M (direct
costs), with 25% ($1.4M) from the NCI. Over the last reporting period, the PSP’s multidisciplinary investigators
more than doubled their peer-reviewed publications (412 vs. 186). Of these, 21% are intra-programmatic, 14%
inter-programmatic, 77% multi-institutional collaborations, and 53% with other NCI-designated Cancer Centers.
In addition, 34% of PSP publications during this period were from journals with an impact factor >5. PSP
members led 21 clinical research studies during 2018 and placed 171 patients on interventional studies and 332
on non-interventional studies. PSP members have used all six MCC core facilities, especially the Biostatistics
and Bioinformatics Core. Initiatives are being generated by newly recruited PSP faculty whose skill sets enhance
the Program scope and Specific Aims by cross-cutting translational working groups, and by close collaborations
with the other MCC Programs and the UT Health SA scientific community."
10891440,"Project Summary-Community Outreach and Engagement (COE)
The Mays Cancer Center (MCC) has developed an Office of Community Outreach and Engagement (COE),
overseen by MCC Associate Director (AD) of COE Amelie Ramirez, Dr.Ph.H., and informed by input from our
Community Advisory Board (CAB) and MCC members. The COE engages the diverse and culturally rich
communities of our catchment area to ensure MCC programs’ practices, education, and research help reduce
cancer burden and health disparities in our catchment area. The COE supports the MCC’s comprehensive
approach to reducing cancer burden while translating the most impactful scientific evidence across the cancer
care continuum.
South Texas is home to 4.7 million people and Hispanics make up 69% of the South Texas population. The MCC
catchment area encompasses a 38-county region in South Texas and stretches from the Texas-Mexico border
to the San Antonio metropolitan area. For many catchment area residents, the MCC is the only place to receive
cancer care. The need is illustrated by the fact that while 77.3% of MCC patients reside in Bexar County (local
to San Antonio), those from the 38-county catchment area comprised 94.5% (255,053/269,929 total cases) of
all MCC cancer cases from 2015-2018. Forty percent of residents in our catchment area are under 25 years old.
Less than 75% of the catchment area population has a high school diploma, and 23.6% live below the poverty
level. The most common cancers among all race and ethnic groups in the catchment area are lung, colorectal,
prostate, breast, and cervical cancer. Notably, incidence of gastric and liver cancers is significantly higher
compared to the state and nation. This cancer burden disproportionally affects our predominantly Hispanic
population, which has higher rates of modifiable cancer-related risk factors, namely obesity and tobacco
smoking; 33% of catchment area adults are obese and 17% are current smokers. Further, adults in our
catchment area underutilize health screenings such as mammograms and colorectal cancer tests.
The MCC COE helps inform MCC’s practices, education, and research by identifying which cancers are
burdening those in our catchment area, especially in our predominantly Hispanic population, and prioritizing
modifiable risk factors. To fulfill the COE’s mission, we propose three Specific Aims: 1) To monitor and evaluate
the catchment area cancer burden and related health disparities through ongoing surveillance of cancer
incidence, mortality, and risk factors; 2) To meaningfully engage the community in planning, implementing, and
disseminating MCC and NCI-supported research; and 3) To help guide MCC’s ongoing and future research to
continue addressing cancer burden through research, education, and health policy change.
The COE has broad expertise in community outreach and education efforts centered around cancer research
and interventions. Important partners are a cadre of bilingual community health workers, and a strong regional
network of federally-funded Area Health Education Centers. The COE interacts with all three MCC Research
Programs, especially the Population Science and Prevention (PSP) Program, and works closely with the
Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource (BBSR) to execute its goals.

10891443,"Project Summary—Leadership, Planning and Evaluation
The Mays Cancer Center (MCC) is led by Director, Ruben A. Mesa, M.D. Dr. Mesa is assisted in this role by
the MCC Senior Leadership, comprised of a Deputy Director and five Associate Directors, each of who has
expertise in their area of responsibility. They are: Tim H-M. Huang, Ph.D., Deputy Director; Virginia
Kaklamani, M.D., D.Sc., Associate Director (AD) for Clinical Research; Robin Leach, Ph.D., AD for Education;
Susan Padalecki, Ph.D., AD for Research Administration; Amelie Ramirez, Dr. P.H., AD for Community
Outreach and Engagement; and LuZhe Sun, Ph.D., AD for Basic Research. Members of the Senior Leadership
provide counsel and recommendations to the Director with final authority for decisions on behalf of the MCC
residing with the Director. The Senior Leadership meets on a monthly basis that also includes the Senior Leaders
from the MCC cancer service line, allowing for integration between the two groups. The Senior Leadership also
meets with the Program Leaders as the Research Executive Committee (REC) bi-weekly. Senior Leadership
works directly with the Program Leaders, Shared Resource Directors, and other MCC committees to build
consensus on MCC priorities that span the breadth of the mission (research, cancer care and education),
strategic planning and implementation, and allocation of resources. The Senior Leaders ensure consistency in
the mission, vision, and goals of the MCC and develop synergistic interactions among the basic, translational,
educational and clinical elements of the Center. They provide feedback on the growth and the needs of the MCC
in their area of responsibility. They also plan and implement proactive, integrative approaches for development
of the research base, resources, and the MCC Strategic Plan. Planning and continual evaluation have been
critical for the development of the MCC and its research infrastructure, and alignment of clinical infrastructure to
support our research goals. The Center uses both internal and external sources for review and evaluation,
soliciting input from Cancer Center experts. The MCC External Advisory Board (EAB) is the primary external
mechanism for review and advice on the MCC and its progress in both clinical and basic research. MCC has
also utilized smaller ad hoc advisory groups for Cancer Center Administration, Shared Resources and Programs.
Internal mechanisms for planning and evaluation center around the Senior Leadership Committee (SLC), REC,
as well as the MCC Internal Advisory Board (IAB) and the MCC Shared Resources Oversight Committee
(SROC). The IAB includes Senior Leaders from UT Health San Antonio (UT Health SA) who meet annually to
provide feedback on the MCC's progress in clinical and research arenas at the UT Health SA. The SROC aids
the Center through annual evaluation of the MCC Shared Resources as well as by making recommendations
related to the Shared Resources. A key part of the MCC planning and evaluation process has been the
development of a MCC Strategic Plan. A number of groups including those mentioned above have had a role
in the strategic planning process. A critical element of the MCC Strategic Plan is building further on the historical
focus of the Center on serving its community and region (catchment area) and understanding cancer in our
predominantly Hispanic population. Other areas of focus include expansion of team science at the MCC,
outreach to other institutions of higher education in the area through cancer research career enhancement, and
targeted recruitment of faculty to build the clinical and research enterprise of the MCC."
10891445,"Project Summary--Clinical Protocol and Data Management
The Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) component of the Mays Cancer Center (MCC) includes
the Clinical Trials Office (CTO), Quality Assurance Division (QAD), and Data and Safety Monitoring Committee
(DSMC). CPDM activities are overseen by the shared leadership of Virginia Kaklamani, M.D., D.Sc., Associate
Director for Clinical Research and Susan Padalecki, Ph.D., Associate Director for Research Administration.
Two full-time Directors, Ms. Cindy McKeown (CTO) and Ms. Melissa Nashawati (QAD), supervise a
centralized staff of 40. The CTO provides central management, research support, and oversight functions for
cancer-related clinical trials at the MCC. The QAD provides data monitoring for investigator-initiated studies,
auditing for protocol compliance, data integrity and patient safety and works closely with the DSMC. The CTO is
mostly centralized, providing overall oversight of regulatory and budgetary functions. Researchers who use
decentralized staff follow the same Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) guidelines, are subject to
audit by QAD and the DSMC, and use a centralized CTMS, have the same job functions, participate in CTO
training, follow CTO standard operating procedures (SOPs) and work in concert with CTO so that it can provide
umbrella oversight. The CTO and QAD provide administrative support for the MCC Clinical Disease Site Teams
(CDSTs), PRMS committees, DSMC, and the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). The DSMC is charged
with overseeing monitoring of participant safety, conduct of clinical trials, the validity and integrity of data for all
cancer-related clinical studies at the MCC. The DSMC has the authority to require protocol amendments for
safety, suspend enrollment or study activities and recommend closure of studies for safety or data issues. Over
the past five years, 7,374 patients were enrolled in cancer-related clinical studies at the MCC. Of those, 2,165
patients were accrued to interventional clinical trials, while 5,209 patients were enrolled on non-interventional
studies. In 2018, 186 studies were open to accrual; 52 (28%) were institutional or externally peer-reviewed
studies and 74 (40%) were NCTN-sponsored studies, the MCC’s highest-priority studies. A total of 783 Hispanic
patients (47%) were enrolled in clinical research studies at the MCC, while 979 (59%) of all patients placed on
trial were minorities, reflecting our large and predominantly Hispanic catchment area. The distribution between
men (52%) and women (48%) newly diagnosed with cancer at MCC in 2018 also reflects the demographics
of our catchment area. The MCC also works to ensure children with cancer have clinical trial opportunities
through multiple Children’s Oncology Group (COG) trials and in collaboration with the Pediatric Oncology
Experimental Therapeutic Investigators Consortium (POETIC), for which MCC is a founding member."

The Management and Administrative Core (Core A) will provide overall leadership and coordination of the
Roybal Center and leverage the Center’s resources to maximize the impact of pilot project activities on health
and health care policy. This Core will provide support to early-stage research projects (predominantly Stage I)
that will catalyze rigorous, low-cost, randomized evaluations of high-impact behavioral interventions to improve
the health outcomes of older adults. We will build upon the expertise of PI Amy Finkelstein and the existing
staff, infrastructure and network of affiliated academics in MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab North
America (J-PAL North America) to achieve several aims.
First, this core will provide leadership, communication, and coordination among investigators, staff, and the
Advisory Committee. Regular communication will ensure collaboration, facilitate knowledge-sharing, and avoid
duplication of efforts. This will include annual in-person meetings, as well as regular opportunities to solicit
advice and feedback regarding design and implementation of studies. Second, this core will provide logistical,
technical, and administrative management and support to ensure compliance with all financial, reporting, and
regulatory requirements of the award. Third, this core will disseminate research findings and lessons learned
for diverse audiences. This core will raise awareness of the MIT Roybal Center and amplify the dissemination
of study results for diverse audiences. Finally, this core will facilitate continued network and partnership
development to support the growth of the network of researchers focusing on the development of interventions
and low-cost evaluations of high-impact, policy-relevant behavioral interventions to improve the health
outcomes of the aging population.
This Core will ensure that Center activities adhere to the overall goal of supporting early to mid-stage, low-
cost, rigorous evaluations of high-impact, policy-relevant behavioral interventions to improve the health of older
adults."
10891450,"ABSTRACT
The Pilot Core will support early to mid-stage research projects to identify, develop, adapt, and evaluate
innovative behavioral interventions related to health and aging. Implementing partners often lack the
expertise, funding, and/or academic team to conduct rigorous evaluations. This Core will address these
common barriers by identifying new areas of study, providing pilot grants to promising projects, supporting
those projects throughout their design and implementation, and ultimately creating a sustained research
agenda to advance the fields of aging and economics to improve health care delivery and health outcomes for
midlife and older people. It will complement and leverage the existing and ongoing related activities of the
Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab North America (J-PAL North America), located at MIT. This Core will
focus on several aims.
First, this core will identify new opportunities to develop and test evidence-informed behavioral interventions
related to health and aging. We will identify innovative, promising behavioral interventions geared towards
improving the health of an aging population that are suitable candidates for low-cost randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). Second, this core will provide pilot funding through a formalized review process for trials of
behavioral interventions related to aging. This core will provide small pilot grants to catalyze early project
activities and provide an early-stage project the resources to raise additional funding. Third, this core will
support funded pilots from the review process through implementation. Researchers in the J-PAL network as
well as others called on to provide their expertise will provide mentorship and feedback to pilot investigators as
they test and iterate on their intervention and study designs. Finally, this core will create a sustained
translational behavioral intervention development program to advance the evidence base in the fields of aging
and behavioral economics. Through this Core’s continued involvement with the funded pilot projects from
Stage I to Stage IV, we aim to spur significant advancements in understanding which behavioral mechanisms
and interventions work to improve the health of older adults."
10891514,"The Administrative Core of the renewal of the Brandeis/Harvard Center to Improve System Performance
of Substance Use Disorder Treatment will provide the organizational and administrative structure to ensure
interaction and collaboration among the multidisciplinary investigators involved in the Cores and the
Component research projects; monitor ongoing progress of the Center; identify activities that need expansion
or reduction or require additional or reallocated resources; facilitate outreach to potential stakeholders,
collaborators, and audiences; and facilitate synergies across the Cores. For this renewal, we will build on and
enhance a successful Administrative Core structure and approach used in the current Center. The two Center
Directors, Dr. Sharon Reif and Dr. Haiden Huskamp, reflect a partnership between the two institutions
(Brandeis University and Harvard Medical School). They will share the responsibility for the overall
coordination and development of the Center and for providing the vision and leadership to position the Center
as a productive national resource for research that continues to inform policy and practice focused on delivery
and payment system innovations. The Center Directors will convene the Leadership Team, which will provide
the main locus of coordination within the Center and is comprised of all Core Leads; each Component research
project PI also will be a Core Lead so these projects are each represented. The external Scientific Advisory
Board (SAB), composed of researchers, experts, persons with lived experience of substance use disorder, and
other stakeholders in a range of fields, will provide objective advice on and assessment of Center priorities and
activities, current and emergent research, and dissemination and communications approaches, as well as
facilitate access to avenues for dissemination. The Administrative Core will dovetail with the Research Core,
which will conduct the research; the Policy/Dissemination Core, which will interact with stakeholders for
bidirectional engagement with the Center’s research and findings to advance policy and practice and conduct a
range of knowledge translation activities; and the Pilot/Mentoring Core, which will develop and support the
Center’s mentoring, networking, training, and pilot paper activities.
The aims of the Administrative Core are to: 1) set priorities for the Center, support Center activities, assess
quality of Center products, and develop synergy; 2) promote collaboration within and outside of the Center and
facilitate interaction with the SAB and consultants; and 3) manage administrative aspects of the Center,
including data resource oversight, evaluation of Center impact, and a communications strategy that promotes
ongoing engagement, translation, dissemination, and other efforts to enhance visibility of the Center, aspects
of its theme, and the Component research projects. This Core will be distinguished from the other Cores by its
focus on the management aspects of the Center. Its role is critical to the success of the Center, and it will
facilitate the advancement of the science related to the Center’s research."
10891446,"Project Summary—Protocol Review and Monitoring System
The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) oversees and ensures the prioritization, feasibility,
scientific merit and progress of all clinical studies at the Mays Cancer Center (MCC). The PRMS consists of two
stages of review, as well as a logistics and feasibility review. Each of these components work in collaboration
with one another to ensure that the right trials for the right population with the right resources open and accrue.
Initial review of protocols and prioritization is performed by the nine Clinical Disease Site Teams (CDSTs),
physician-led groups focused on a particular disease site or area of interest. Scientific rigor and progress are
evaluated by the Protocol Review Committee (PRC). The PRC evaluates statistical accuracy of the protocol,
drug dosages and reviews the rational, innovation, preclinical data, impact and significance of the cancer-related
trials. Though not part of the PRMS, the Clinical Trial Operations Committee (CTOC) reviews protocols for
feasibility, safety and logistics. The PRMS evaluation process occurs prior to submission to the UT Health SA
Institutional Review Board (IRB) and is required for IRB approval. Importantly, the PRMS process is
complementary to the IRB review, occurs in tandem, and does not overlap or duplicate their responsibilities. The
IRB will not approve a protocol without the PRC's approval. After a study has opened to accrual, the PRC
provides ongoing review to ensure adequate accrual and scientific progress. The PRC has the authority to close
studies that have not progressed toward their intended scientific objectives. In 2018, the MCC PRMS Committee
reviewed 78 trials. Of those, 77 were approved and opened to accrual, 1 was not approved, and 2 studies were
closed for lack of progress/accrual."
10891515,"The Pilot/Mentoring Core for the renewal of the Brandeis/Harvard Center to Improve System Performance
of Substance Use Disorder Treatment will continue to advance the addiction health services research field
by encouraging, developing, and supporting investigators who are interested in conducting innovative research
related to delivery and payment of SUD treatment services. The activities of this new Core will focus on early
career investigators (doctoral students, post-doctoral fellows, early career faculty/researchers), but also will
benefit mid-career and senior researchers. Key elements will include mentoring programs, networking
activities, and educational opportunities, including a new Brandeis/Harvard Center of Excellence Systems
Performance Scholars Program. In addition, the Center will continue to support the development of important
new research by expanding awards to early career investigators to develop mentored “pilot” papers or small
studies that will advance the science in this area and serve as foundational work for their research agendas.
Additionally, the Center renewal will have an intentional focus on racial/ethnic diversity outreach in mentoring
to expand the range of perspectives in the field and to support the addiction health services research careers
of underrepresented populations.
The aims of the Pilot/Mentoring Core are to: 1) expand mentoring, networking, and educational opportunities
for a racially/ethnically diverse array of early career investigators interested in conducting research in areas
related to the theme of the Center; and 2) continue to advance the field by offering opportunities for early
career investigators to develop new, cutting-edge research ideas related to the Center theme through funded
pilot papers. The Pilot/Mentoring Core will work synergistically with the Research Core to further the combined
aims of advancing the science and developing the next generation of addiction services researchers. The
renewal Center is well poised to advance these dual goals building on successes in the current Center. Our
focus on mentoring and training will allow the Center to provide both formal and informal experiences that will
lead to the expansion of research on SUD delivery and payment systems and a broadening of the field of
researchers working on these important issues. Through the mentoring and networking opportunities created,
the Center will provide forums for the exchange of ideas, both to and from the Center, to be incorporated into
future research. These activities will serve to expand and advance the field of addiction health services
research and create strong, diverse networks of early career and senior investigators who will collaborate to
address the most vexing research questions in the field."

10894315,"Project Summary
Despite being hailed as the “magic bullet” that would selectively target and cure cancer, only a handful of
nanoparticles have been successfully translated to the clinic, and their full potential remains yet to be realized.
In fact, nanoparticle accumulation in tumors continues to be dismally low, with less than 1% of the injected dose
reaching its target. This is largely attributed to the complexity and heterogeneity of both the biological
environment and nanoparticle constructs, making it impossible to deconvolute individual factors contributing to
nanoparticle targeting and accumulation in tumors. Therefore, there is a critical need to better understand and
define the attributes that define successful nanocarriers. This is particularly urgent in lethal cancers that stand to
benefit tremendously from new and targeted therapies, like ovarian cancer, which has a 25% 5-year survival rate
and 70% recurrence rate following chemotherapy, often leading to treatment resistant disease. To develop
effective drug delivery strategies, it is critically important to understand the characteristics of tumors,
nanoparticles, and their interactions, such as by identifying the genetic features associated with high nanoparticle
uptake and accumulation. To accomplish this, the work proposed herein features a chemical barcoding approach
to enable pooled high throughput analysis of nanoparticles in a pre-clinical context, enabling the identification
and correlation of genetic features responsible for successful nanoparticle targeting through a multi-omics
approach. Successful development of this barcoding platform will entail 1) rapid integrated in vitro screening of
pooled NP formulations, 2) in vivo single system evaluation of nanoparticle accumulation at the tissue and cellular
level, and 3) use of pooled barcoded nanoparticles to correlate particle trafficking in patient derived models of
ovarian cancer. This strategy will provide a holistic evaluation of nanoparticle structure-function relationships
with tumor accumulation and enable the identification of genetic components implicated with meaningful
nanoparticle interactions, allowing us to leverage these signatures to develop more effective targeted
nanoparticles to specific tumor cell populations. The proposed work will take place at MIT’s Koch Institute for
Integrative Cancer Research, a premier institution for cancer research with state-of-the-art facilities, under the
mentorship of Prof. Paula Hammond, a renowned chemical engineer and polymer chemist with expertise in the
self-assembly of materials and drug delivery. An advisory team has carefully been assembled, consisting of
Profs. Stuart Schreiber and Angela Koehler for chemical biology and multi-omics analysis guidance, Prof. Joan
Brugge for her cancer biology expertise, and Prof. Nathalie Agar for input on mass spectrometry-based analysis.
Combined, this research proposal and mentorship team will lay the scientific groundwork and provide the
necessary training for the applicant to reach her ultimate goal of successfully starting her independent academic
career at the interface of chemistry, biology, and materials science."

The proposed work will fund two postdoctoral scholars from varied disciplines each for 3 years to focus on equity
in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. This application will create a training program for early career
researchers from the United States (U.S.) who are passionate about brain health for underserved communities.
We will leverage two outstanding programs at the University of California at San Francisco’s (UCSF). The Global
Brain Health Institute (GBHI) led by MPD/PI, Victor Valcour, which leads a 12-month international training
program in equity and dementia with a particular focus on low and middle income countries. This 12-month
course enrolls international and inter-professional trainees and provides an equity-based curriculum in
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, leadership training, career mentoring and a robust alumni
experience to advance their careers. The UCSF Memory and Aging Center (MAC), led by MPD/PI, Bruce Miller,
has a remarkable record in training successful academic behavioral neurologists with a T32-funded behavioral
neurology training program (BNTP). This remarkable environment provides outstanding research opportunities
for trainees supported by the current T32 application to research Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.
Although GBHI does not exclude applications from the US and has a track-record of successful engagement of
U.S. citizens, the one-year curriculum is insufficient for early-stage trainees (e.g. postdocs) who typically require
2-3 years of support in order to successfully transition to academic posts. The two-year BNTP fellowship accepts
only doctors, is neurologically-focused and does not specifically focus upon brain health equity. This T32 will fill
this gap in both programs by intentionally targeting multi-disciplinary early career patient-oriented researchers
and by providing 3-years of support. These T32 trainees will leverage the most robust aspects of coursework
and environment provided by the curriculum at GBHI and the MAC while also working with faculty across multiple
departments at UCSF as they advance trajectories toward independence. Our application includes substantial
novelty in that trainees will be working with other international trainees who are in later stages of their career and
will serve as experts for work in diverse immigrant communities in the U.S. Our long-term goal is to contribute to
the pool of academic research working together to better understand disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias and create culturally appropriate solutions to optimize diagnosis and care for underserved
groups."
10894320,"Project Summary/Abstract
Rare genetic disorders are a major cause of human morbidity, frequently affect brain development and cause
neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we propose using Noonan syndrome (NS, 1:2000) as a human model
system to provide critical data on the effects of Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (RMK)-genetic alterations
on the human brain's complex systems-level biology. Three lines of evidence support using NS as a human
model system: 1) NS is caused by autosomal dominant mutations of high penetrance in specific genes
compared to idiopathic neurodevelopmental disorders genetics of common variance, 2) NS has a larger impact
on brain development and thus larger effect sizes than idiopathic neurodevelopmental disorders, 3) NS is
associated with increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention abilities, learning
disabilities, and autism spectrum symptoms.
Our lab has recently observed the effect of NS mutations in the PTPN11 gene on human brain structure,
specifically the striatum, and brain function, specifically frontostriatal connectivity. However, there is limited
data available on the effect of other NS mutations, RAF1 and SOS1, on the developing brain. To address this
limitation, we propose determining whether three major NS disease genes RAF1, PTPN11, and SOS1
mutations, are associated with striatal alteration in a gradient of severity. To provide critical data on the
relationships between PTPN11 genetic variance and brain development, we will test whether PTPN11
pathogenic variants are associated with altered brain development. Finally, we will test whether whole-brain
connectivity can predict attention abilities in NS. This aim will provide a neuromarker for attention abilities
(specifically inhibition) in NS.
We will perform ""deep phenotyping"" - imaging studies of the striatum (volume, cellular density, seed-based
functional connectivity) and the whole brain (surface area, cortical thickness, white matter, cortical myelin
content, and whole-brain functional connectivity) and assess attention (inhibition) in children (7-16 years of
age) with RAF1 (n=30), PTPN11 (n=45), and SOS1 (n=30) mutations, and compare them to typically
developing controls (n=45). Two innovative aspects of the proposed work are using restriction spectrum
imaging (RSI) to map the RMK pathway upregulation effect on the striatum cellular density. Second, we will
assess the effect of RAF1 mutations on brain development for the first time.
Defining the relationships between the brain and Noonan's genetics will accelerate the use of genetic testing to
inform prognosis and treatments in NS. Further, describing these relationships will provide critical data on the
role of the RMK in brain development."
10894321,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, fatal condition characterized by the gradual occlusion of the
pulmonary arterioles leading to progressively increased pulmonary vascular resistance with worsening right heart
failure and death. While rare mutations (e.g., in BMPR2) have been reported in a minority of patients, most
patients carry no established mutations. We recently published on common genetic variation in 2,085
idiopathic/heritable (I/H) PAH cases and 9,659 controls of European ancestry using a genome-wide association
(GWA) approach. Discovery and replication analyses were conducted in four independent cohorts with
genotyping arrays from our US-based PAH Biobank (PAHB) study and three international cohorts with whole
genome sequence data. We reported two novel loci, at HLA-DPA1/DPB1 and near SOX17 associated I/H PAH.
HLA-DPA/DPB1 locus predicts a reduced annual mortality rate by 25-37% in I/H PAH. The lead SOX17 variant
is located in a putative enhancer region in close spatial proximity to the SOX17 gene in endothelial cell (EC)
precursors, which influences its expression based on our experimental validation. Our findings provide the first
support for the contribution of common genetic variance to PAH risk and, combined with the recently reported
data on rare mutations in SOX17 in PAH, highlight the causal role of SOX17 in PAH. Beyond PAH risk, we now
hypothesize that PAH progression and outcomes are also genetically modified including from SOX17, a
transcription factor, and HLA-DPA1/DPB1 as both novel candidate genes and possible therapeutic targets. To
test this hypothesis, we have developed 3 specific aims (SAs) that will further expand the PAHB, the world’s
largest PAH biobank, registry, and multi-omics dataset with whole exome sequencing (WES), RNAseq, whole
genome genotyping, and non-targeted metabolomics data on nearly all subjects. SA #1 will collect serial
longitudinal data in PAHB to interrogate associations between disease risk loci (SOX17, HLA-DPA/B1) with
markers of PAH progression. We will also evaluate expression (eQTL) and metabolomics (mQTL) quantitative trait
loci analyses for functional validation. Beyond disease risk SOX17/HLA loci, we generated additional preliminary
data revealing genome-wide significance for seven novel genetic loci associated directly with survival in PAH in
a second, independent PAH cohort. SA #2 will now replicate these new findings with outcomes (progression and
survival) collected in PAHB from SA #1. As a unique feature of this proposal, we will interrogate our top loci in two
other global PAH cohorts with available eQTL and mQTL data and perform a meta-analysis of all cohorts. We will
also construct a risk stratification tool combining clinical risk factors and genetics (SOX17, HLA, 7 SNPs) for PAH
outcomes. Finally, based on preliminary data on the protective role of SOX17 in EC function, SA #3 will validate
the biological role of SOX17 pathway in the development of PAH using ECs/SMCs isolated from PAH patients
as well as pre-clinical testing in murine PH models. Strong clinical association of these two new loci has
implications for prediction of clinical outcomes, clinical trial design, and the development of novel drug targets."
10894205,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells can be very effective in advanced hematological malignancies,
autologous products often have variable potency and require complex and expensive manufacturing, limiting
their scalability and accessibility. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop a well-characterized, ‘off-
the-shelf’ (OTS) therapeutic T-cell platform using banked T-cells pre-manufactured from healthy donors, thus
offering immediate availability and high potency at a reduced cost. One major limitation of this approach is
potential immune rejection of infused OTS T-cells by host T- and NK-cells, which would impair persistence and
clinical benefit of the T-cell therapy. Therefore, my graduate dissertation project (Aim 1) focuses on engineering
OTS therapeutic T-cells to resist host immune rejection. I have developed the ‘first-in-class’ chimeric
alloimmune defense receptor (ADR) which enables allogeneic OTS CAR T-cells to defend themselves by
selectively eliminating activated host alloreactive lymphocytes while sparing other resting non-alloreactive cells.
T-cells co-expressing a 4-1BB-directed ADR and a CAR evade immune rejection and produce long-term anti-
tumor activity in mouse models of OTS CAR T-cell therapy for both liquid and solid tumors. We are now
optimizing the 4-1BB-specific ADR for clinical translation and will initiate a Phase I clinical study in our center. I
am also exploring other potential ADR targets, including OX40 and CD40L, to maximize the anti-rejection activity.
In addition to alloimmune rejection, activity of OTS T-cells in solid tumors can be inhibited by the
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Mounting evidence suggests that the inflammatory milieu
created by therapeutic T-cells may elicit reactive changes both locally (in the TME) and systemically (in
circulation) that further inhibit anti-tumor activity of therapeutic T-cells and possibly promote tumor growth and
metastasis. Examples include a surge of immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages in neuroblastoma patients
receiving GD2 CAR T-cells and poor responses to CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in patients with high circulating
myeloid-derived suppressor cells. In addition, preclinical studies indicate that treatment-induced inflammation
enhances pre-metastatic niche (PMN) formation and increases the risk of metastasis. Therefore, during my post-
doctoral training (Aim 2), I will first elucidate the reactive changes (both in TME and in circulation) caused by
therapeutic T-cells and identify cellular/molecular mediators of enhanced immunosuppression at the primary
tumor site. I will also investigate how T-cell therapies may affect PMN formation in solid tumors. I will then further
modify therapeutic T-cells to counteract these unwanted responses by arming them with secreted factors
(antibodies, peptide inhibitors) to block the responsible cytokines / chemokines, or by enabling them to selectively
eliminate inhibitory cellular subsets in the TME.
Successful completion of both Aims will ultimately improve the efficacy of OTS T-cell therapies of cancer."

Peripheral membrane proteins (PMPs) represent crucial mediators of biological and disease processes. This
class of proteins exists in a water-soluble state until targeted to adhere on membranes, enabling them to
perform their function. As with any membrane associated protein, PMPs are challenging to study, particularly in
their membrane bound state, leaving many basic questions about function unresolved. Additionally, utilizing
PMPs as drug targets is difficult since current methods are designed for water-soluble proteins and do not work
well for membrane associated proteins. Thus, there is a great need for novel tools and procedures to illuminate
details of PMP function and to create PMP inhibitors for use in chemical biology study and as drug leads. The
goal of our research is to enable high-resolution, quantitative study of PMP interactions and allow inhibitor
design for this elusive type of protein. We will initially focus our efforts on three PMPs of extraordinary
biomedical interest: glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) and Phox homology (PX) domains in the NADPH oxidase
family (p47phox-PX and NOXO1-PX). We have initiated development of a novel membrane model, membrane-
mimicking reverse micelles (mmRMs), which is based on the chemistry of cellular membranes. PMPs embed
into mmRMs as they do with cellular membranes, enabling high-resolution study using NMR spectroscopy and
other techniques. mmRMs have a number of advantages over current models, including greatly enhanced
stability, outstanding spectroscopic properties, and an ability to house high concentrations of analyte along with
the protein. We will modify our mmRM system to better reflect a variety of cellular and organelle membranes,
allowing the system to be tuned according to the natural PMP environment. Our focus will then be to harness
the unique properties of our mmRMs to enable unrivaled detail in study and quantification of PMP interactions
with membranes and lipid substrates. To facilitate inhibitor design, we will develop a novel method that allows
fragment screening of membrane-embedded PMPs, for which current methods are not suitable. Using these
tools, we will initiate an inhibitor design campaign for our important PMP targets. Overall, our goal is to develop
tools that will enable breakthroughs in detailed study of PMP biology as well as inhibitor and drug development
for this largely untapped class of proteins."

There are major challenges facing the nephrology community in the United States. One is the overall
decrease in interest in nephrology as a specialty; the second one is the overall decreased interest in
a career as physician scientist. Therefore, implementation of programs at earlier stages of training in
areas where the interest in academic medicine is diminishing is a priority. The long-term goal of this
proposal is to increase the interest in nephrology among medical school trainees in Florida. In order
to achieve this goal, we propose to engage ten first year medical students in a summer program
designed to foster interest in nephrology by exposing students to basic, clinical, and translational
science research opportunities. This state-wide summer school of nephrology will be named UM-
KIIMERA: University of Miami Kidney Innovative & Interdisciplinary Medical Education in Research
Activities. In order the achieve the proposed goal, the specific aims of this program are: a) Engage
ten first year medical students (five from UM, and 5 from other Florida Institutions) in a eight-week
summer research program (b) Retain the engaged students by promoting their participation in
Nephrology scholarly activities, attending local and national nephrology meeting, and become active
members of the local APSA chapter. UM-KIIMERA curriculum will include lectures on clinical,
translational and experimental research, a mentor-mentee breakfast, a welcome symposium, a eight-
week immersive experience in a specific research project, a dedicated journal club, a closing
Saturday morning with brief presentations and an introduction to members of the University of Miami
American Physician Scientist Association (APSA) chapter. Several post course scholarly activities
and research opportunities are provided to maintain the students engaged in the program throughout
medical school. The program is designed to empower and be empowered by existing training grants
and Institutional research opportunities and events. An organizing program committee will operate
under the supervision of an External Advisory Committee (EAB). A selected group of CTSI certified
mentors will be available to the students. Outcome metrics such as U-KIIMERA students career
choice will be collected yearly and utilized to guide the program towards its goals."
10894322,"ClinGen CHD ECP Project Summary Abstract
 Congenital heart defects (CHD), defined as structural malformations of the heart and great vessels that
are present at birth, are the commonest birth defects, affecting 2-3% of newborns when bicuspid aortic valve is
included. While understood to be potentially a heritable trait as early as the mid-1800s, definitive
epidemiological evidence supporting the notion that CHD was primarily genetic in its origins has only emerged
in the last 35 years. To date, 253 genes contributing to CHD have been established but a far smaller number of
genes have been designated as CHD-causing using formal ClinGen gene curation. Furthermore, and there are
clinically relevant discrepancies for individual variants (i.e., pathogenic/likely pathogenic vs. benign/likely
benign) in a substantial number of these genes. Sequencing-based clinical genetic testing using CHD gene
panels facilitates diagnoses for which there are actionable co-morbidities that would often go otherwise
undetected, particularly in young infants in whom syndromic features may not yet be evident but available
commercial CHD genetic testing panels vary substantially in their gene content. The proposed CHD ECP will
bring together experts in CHD genes from around the world which, in a well-organized, ClinGen-compliant
manner, will curate gene-CHD pairs and classify their variants. The MPI's and many of the Expert Curation
Panel members have extensive prior collaboration on a long-standing NIH-supported consortium (Pediatric
Cardiac Genomic Consortium) that has and continues to elucidate the genetic architecture of the trait of
interest (CHD) thus bringing significant gene and variant curation experience. An emphasis will be placed on
developing experimental evidence criteria for a given CHD trait, drawing from a notably broad range of science
(biochemical, cell-based, and animal models of heart development). This effort is well timed as the numbers of
potential genes available for clinical genetic testing is rising rapidly and the clinical utility of such testing is well
established. Further, candidate CHD genes with compelling human genetic evidence for pathogenicity but
scant functional data can be shared with the cardiac developmental research community for consideration. The
CHD ECP will fill an important gap in clinical care."

 This application aims to broaden the research expertise of Dr. Xu, who has a background in
bioengineering, by delving into clinical research of neurodegenerative diseases. The goal is to support her pursuit
of an independent research career focused on using advanced neuroimaging techniques to identify cognitive
decline caused by vascular insults. It is increasingly recognized that cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) is influenced by factors beyond the plaques and tangles, including small vessel diseases. Vascular
dysfunction seems to precede tissue atrophy resulting from neuronal degeneration, suggesting that measuring
vascular function could insights into alternative pathologies contributing to early-stage cognitive dysfunction. Dr.
Xu recently developed a non-invasive method of measuring arterial cerebral blood volume (CBVa) using the
novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique called the Fourier transform-based (FT-) velocity-selective
(VS) arterial spin labeling (ASL). In this proposed research, the FT-VS ASL will be applied to investigate the
relationship between CBVa and cognitive function. To pursue this line of research, Dr. Xu will aim to bridge the
gap between her engineering background and clinical dementia research through structured mentorship,
acquiring clinical training from conferences and seminars, and conducting mentored research on the association
between CBVa and cognitive function in individuals with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia. The central
hypothesis is that CBVa will be higher among those with MCI and mild dementia and higher CBVa will be
associated with poorer cognitive performance. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1)
To refine the FT-VS ASL method for measuring CBVa. (2) To compare group differences in multi-compartment
CBV (arterial vs total) among cognitively normal young and older (controls), individuals with MCI, and those with
mild AD dementia. Additionally, to determine the cross-sectional association between CBVa and cognitive
function in participants with normal cognition, MCI, and mild AD dementia. (3) To assess the association between
longitudinal changes in cognitive function and CBVa. Upon completion of this research, the expected outcomes
include the development of a robust non-invasive tool for quantifying regional CBVa. Furthermore, understanding
the association between CBVa and cognitive function will shed light on the vascular contribution to dementia.
These outcomes will form the foundation for a competitive R01 grant application, which will prepare Dr. Xu to
become an independent investigator examining the merit of CBVa as a biomarker for dementia in a large cohort
and comparing its efficacy with other biomarkers related to AD and related dementias (ADRD)."
10886377,"The overarching goal of this proposal is the development of the candidate into an independent investigator in
the field of immune modulatory cell therapy for critically ill children, particularly those post hematopoietic stem
cell transplant (HSCT). With her clinical and research background in pediatric critical care and T cell
immunotherapy, she is ideally positioned to fully realize the benefits of an NIH Mentored Career Development
Award. This research proposal seeks to establish the safety and preliminary efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy
with donor-derived SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells (CST) for prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients
post HSCT by conducting an FDA- and IRB-approved phase I clinical trial (NCT 05141058) and to develop CSTs
genetically engineered to maintain antiviral activity in the presence of the commonly used lymphodepleting agent,
alemtuzumab. The specific aims of the proposal are: 1) to determine whether infusion of donor-derived CSTs
safely enhances antiviral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in patients early (<4 months) post HSCT, and 2) to genetically
engineer CSTs to retain antiviral activity in vitro in the presence of alemtuzumab. Together, these aims will
establish the safety and preliminary efficacy of CST prophylaxis in the post HSCT population and lay the
foundation for a “next generation” of virus-specific T cells (VST) engineered to resist immunosuppressive peri-
transplant drugs. In addition, they will develop the candidate's expertise in T cell immunobiology, high throughput
sequencing, gene editing, and early phase clinical trials. The candidate has assembled an outstanding advisory
team who are highly qualified to guide her in the pursuit of her career and research goals. Her primary mentor
and co-mentor, Drs. Catherine Bollard and Michael Keller, are world-renowned experts in immune modulatory
cellular therapy and T cell immunobiology. Dr. Matthew Porteus, a pioneer in the field of gene therapy, will guide
her work developing genetically engineered CSTs. In addition, Dr. Patrick Hanley, Director of the Good
Manufacturing Processes Laboratory at Children's National Hospital, will oversee production of the CST product
(IND 27588); Dr. Rick Jones will advise and oversee trial conduct at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (JHMI);
and Dr. Wei Li will provide bioinformatic support for both CRISPR and high throughput sequencing experiments.
A selection of focused coursework and seminars will facilitate investigator independence by the end of the award
period. The candidate will benefit from a superb academic environment and extensive resources available
through the Center for Cancer and Immunology Research, the Genetic Medicine Research Center, and the
Clinical and Translational Science Institute at Children's National, as well as from in-person training in gene
editing in the Porteus laboratory. In summary, this proposal describes a plan that is relevant, feasible, and will
provide the necessary mentorship and training to promote the candidate's development into an independent
clinician scientist in the field of cellular immune modulatory therapy."
10886378,"Project Summary
Sexual minority women (SMW) are twice as likely to report risky drinking behaviors as heterosexual women.
One cause of this disparity is structural stigma, which refers to contextual-level conditions, norms, and policies
that constrain opportunities, resources, and well-being. [Structural stigma also has intergenerational impacts,
evidenced by its adverse effects among children and infants across marginalized groups. However, little is
known about when structural stigma is most harmful across the lifecourse for SMW and the extent to which
intergenerational effects impact offspring health behaviors. Further, the mechanisms of these intergenera-
tional effects are underexplored, as are the moderating risk and resiliency factors. These knowledge gaps con-
tribute to perpetuating alcohol-related health disparities and limit our understanding of what factors may re-
duce risk among SMW and their children.] It has not been previously possible to examine these associations
because doing so requires a unique data structure with: 1) a large number of SMW living in different places and
measured over their lifecourse; 2) longitudinal structural stigma measures, which are very limited prior to the
1990s; and 3) alcohol measures among both parents and offspring. This mentored research proposal will pro-
vide the first opportunity to address these questions by pairing training in structural stigma measurement over
time using natural language processing (NLP) with data from two unique, intergenerational cohort studies: the
Nurses’ Health Study 2 (N=116,429), and their offspring in the linked Growing Up Today Study (N=27,704).
[By leveraging NLP on a corpus of >9,000 unique, digitized newspapers from all 50 US states during the
lifecourse of respondents in the Nurses’ Health Study 2 (75 years), I will develop and extensively validate a
time-varying measure of structural stigma related to sexual orientation (Aim 1). I will then elucidate the associ-
ation between structural stigma and alcohol use across the lifecourse among SMW (Aim 2) and their offspring
(Aim 3) and examine intervenable, modifiable characteristics moderate the effects of structural stigma. Ad-
vanced training in NLP and lifecourse epidemiology will provide the necessary tools to develop a novel struc-
tural stigma measure and test its relationship with alcohol consumption among SMW and their offspring
across the lifecourse, representing a critical next step for understanding and decreasing alcohol-related health
inequalities. This award will support essential career development in my path toward independence as an alco-
hol and stigma researcher and is highly consistent with NIAAA’s priorities for understanding the social con-
texts of drinking behavior in minoritized populations. The proposed studies are the essential next step towards
identifying modifiable targets for protecting against the impact of stigma on risky drinking and laying the foun-
dation for similar research in other stigmatized, high-risk populations. This work represents an innovative ap-
proach to understand the reverberating impact of structural stigma not only on those who are stigmatized but
also across generations.]"

 Chiari malformation (CM) is a challenging disease that frequently presents during development in the
pediatric age range. Despite its well-defined anatomic pathology, characterized by ectopic position of the
cerebellar tonsils herniating through the foramen magnum, its clinical phenotype is variable. Here we propose
an advanced neuroimaging study to seek novel explanations for CM symptomology through personalized
connectomics using resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). In Aim 1, we will first capitalize on publicly shared
data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study for incidentally identified CM subjects
and typically developing controls. In Aim 2, we will acquire identical ABCD protocol MRI data at presentation
and longitudinal timepoints in both surgical and non-surgical subjects who are symptomatic and present for
clinical care. We will replicate the imaging and cognitive testing from the ABCD Study in our clinical cohort for
direct comparisons. We will also record the Chiari Severity Index (CSI) and Chiari Health Index in Pediatrics
(CHIP) metrics, which have been developed and validated specific to CM, in our clinical cohort. Finally, in Aim
3, for a subset of participants we will obtain highly sampled longitudinal data at frequent timepoints after
surgical intervention to better characterize the time course of functional connectivity (FC) changes, or
potentially confirm if any lack of change could be dependent on timing of data collection. This final aim will be
critical for future studies of similar design to optimize decisions on how long after surgery imaging should
ideally be acquired to maximize effect measured and avoid missing a transient effect. The FC changes and
correlations to natural history, symptoms, and response to treatment will be valuable as potential biomarkers of
disease that could be used to guide treatment decisions for future clinical care. While this study is aimed at
evaluating FC as a potential marker of cognitive dysfunction specific to CM, its methodology and design will be
adapted to several other novel pathologies in the future as my research career develops. Furthermore, the
results of this study will provide fundamental knowledge about the relationship between brain structure and
function. Specifically, for CM these results relate mechanical compression from ectopic position of the
cerebellar tonsils to FC in resting state networks throughout the brain and its related cognitive symptoms. In
this manner, we are directly addressing the aims of the NINDS by assessing basic cognitive neuroscience
fundamentals of disease in CM and its potential for translation to clinical care of neurologic disease. The data
collection and analysis methods are part of a focused plan to advance my career development through training
in acquisition of advanced fMRI data, surface-based analysis, and large data analysis from the ABCD Study
dataset. In parallel, I will participate in course work including responsible conduct of research, scientific writing
and communication, and cognitive neuroscience."
10887059,"Project Summary
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth-most lethal cancer across both sexes, with five-year overall survival of all stages
at 12%. In patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, first-line chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-
paclitaxel with or without FOLFIRINOX often requires second-line chemotherapy combinations, with median
survival ranging from 6 to 26 months. New therapeutic combinations are needed. One promising approach for
overcoming this impasse centers on senescence. Cells can undergo senescence in response to replication,
oncogene induction, or targeted drug therapy, including most chemotherapeutic regimens used for pancreatic
cancer. However, while senescent cells have been implicated in tumorigenesis via pro-inflammatory factors seen
in circulation as part of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), their direct tumoral activity over
time and distribution elsewhere is unknown. Moreover, current senescence imaging agents are small molecules
measuring lysosome activity. An antibody-based approach, in contrast, offers greater targeting specificity and
biological links to surface antigens. Noninvasive PET tools for senescence antigens will improve our ability to
identify senescence with the option to change the isotope for targeted alpha therapy in the tumor.
The members of the Scott Lowe Lab have pioneered senescence induction in pancreatic cancer with the
combination of trametinib (T) and palbociclib (P), leading to the release of cytokines as SASP remodels the
tumor microenvironment and beyond. Using immunoPET to study combination TP therapy in their models, we
have found that shed antigens such as VEGF and IL-6 are decreased in the tumor environment while membrane-
bound antigens like uPAR are elevated. We hypothesize that senescence induced by chemotherapy is temporal
and immunoPET can be used noninvasively to quantify these dynamics during therapy. In collaboration with the
Scott Lowe and Christine Iacobuzio-Donahue Labs at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, we will use
noninvasive immunoPET imaging to (1) quantify previously identified senescence markers during senescence-
inducing therapy in human and murine pancreatic cancer models, (2) independently discover more senescence-
specific markers, and (3) use targeted immunoPET agents for endoradiotherapy and improved senolytic delivery.
In collaboration with Patricia Ribeiro Pereira at Washington University at St. Louis, we will also identify
pharmacologic methods to prevent antigen shed, while advanced PET reconstruction with Joaquin Lopez-
Herraiz at Complutense University Madrid will enable dual radiotracer immunoPET imaging of immune
populations during therapy. Our efforts to quantify senescence in vivo with the proposed markers and enhance
targeted alpha therapy with senescence will be guided by Dr. Lisa Bodei for clinical relevance and Andrea
Schietinger for immunological insight. This work will unlock multiple directions in the precision theranostics of
senescence, with great potential for career development and R01 research encompassing numerous cancers."
10887123,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid use and deaths from overdoses have skyrocketed in the United States over recent years. Most people
with opioid use disorder (OUD) relapse within weeks to months despite treatment. Relapse vulnerability is
strongly associated with severe and persistent sleep and circadian rhythm disruptions, suggesting therapeutics
that mitigate these alterations during withdrawal and abstinence may reduce craving and risk for relapse.
However, our understanding of the mechanisms across cellular and molecular levels in the brains of people with
OUD is extremely limited. We recently demonstrated alterations in several pathways related to dopamine, opioid,
and glutamate signaling in human brain associated with OUD. We also reported significant disruptions in
molecular rhythms associated with OUD in human nucleus accumbens (NAc), a major neural substrate for
reward and motivation, and a key region involved in arousal, sleep, and circadian rhythms. We and others
developed a novel and innovative approach for using time-of-death (TOD) of the subject to measure molecular
rhythms in postmortem brain associated with various psychiatric disorders to gain insights into disease-specific
neurobiological mechanisms and pathways in human brain. In this proposal, we will use TOD computational
tools combined with single nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) to investigate the relationship between
molecular rhythm disruption in specific cell types of the NAc in OUD using postmortem brains from unaffected
subjects and subjects with OUD. In Aim 1, we will use snRNA-seq and TOD analyses to create a cell type
specific map of molecular rhythms in the human NAc using control, ‘neurotypical’ subjects. In Aim 2, we will
compare molecular rhythms in specific cell types of the NAc from unaffected subjects to molecular rhythms in
NAc cell types from subjects with OUD to determine the extent of molecular rhythm disruptions associated with
OUD at the cellular level. Our studies will define the loss and gain of molecular rhythms in NAc cell types
associated with OUD, in addition to providing a framework for uncovering the temporal relationships (i.e.,
circadian) in transcript expression between different cell types in human brain. snRNA-seq findings will be
validated using spatial transcriptomics (MERSCOPE). The findings from our proposal will resolve molecular
rhythm alterations at the cellular level in the brains of subjects with OUD to begin to identify the mechanisms
underlying the relationships between circadian rhythms and OUD in the hopes of progressing towards strategies
that target the circadian system in the treatment of OUD."
10871804,"In the heart, there are two types of L-type calcium channels, the classical Cav1.2 and the novel
less characterized Cav1.3. They both convert cell-membrane depolarization into calcium
transients and initiate excitation-contraction coupling. Interestingly, Cav1.3 is expressed in the
supraventricular tissue and ventricles of the fetal and neonatal hearts but not in the ventricles of
the adult heart. Cav1.3 also has an extended C-terminus. Relevant to this application is that our
preliminary data demonstrate that the C-terminus of Cav1.3 is mobile and functions as a
transcription auto-enhancer of its own Cav1.3 gene. This unique endogenous property can be
leveraged to generate inotropic force necessary to restore cardiac function in the setting of heart
failure which is highly prevalent in Veterans. Here we will test, for the first time, the hypothesis
that the translocation of the Cav1.3 C-terminus mobile fragment to the nucleus will upregulate
Cav1.3 gene expression at specific promoter region(s) and thus provide additional calcium entry
into the cardiac myocyte resulting in improved cardiac function in a murine model of heart
failure. This hypothesis will be tested in three aims: Aim 1: Investigate the regulation of gene
expression by C-terminus of Cav1.3 in a native environment; Aim 2: Determine the mechanisms
of Cav1.3 C-terminus regulation of Cav1.3 gene promoter activity; Aim 3: Investigate the
potential therapeutic impact of Cav1.3 C-terminus in heart failure. Studies will be carried out by
a combination of electrophysiological (patch-clamp and optical mapping), RNA-seq,
biochemical, echocardiography and histology, in in-vivo and ex-vivo hearts. The findings from
this work will provide a novel mechanism by which Cav1.3 L-type calcium channel acts not only
as a conventional ion pore but also as a transcription factor regulating gene expression and cell
function via its C-terminus. The ability of the C-terminus of Cav1.3 to upregulate its own gene
can be exploited for the development of novel inotropic therapies for heart failure which is
prevalent in Veterans."
10871805,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is highly prevalent in U.S. military service members and Veterans due to the impact of joint
trauma and overuse injury. Its socioeconomic impact is substantial, estimated to approach $60 billion per year,
and no disease-modifying treatments exist. The overall goal of the collaborative Program is to develop a
treatment for post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) that will relieve pain and improve function. We hypothesize
that PTOA is caused by maladaptive repair responses including activation of the pro-inflammatory pathways of
innate immunity that in turn result in pain, loss of function and structural decline. This Program address the
hypothesis through two highly-integrated aims: (1) developing innovative non-pharmacologic and intra-articular
therapies inhibiting local pain and inflammation, and (2) optimizing mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based
therapies for reconstruction of the damaged joint.
The goal of this proposal is to develop novel therapy to diminish OA-associated pain by reducing inflammation
and bone remodeling through inhibition of the receptor CD14. We were the first to discover high levels of CD14
in OA patients, and others subsequently linked CD14 to pain in OA patients. CD14 is a pattern-recognition
receptor expressed by monocytes, macrophages and osteoclasts (bone-resorbing myeloid cells), that
augments innate immune responses to tissue injury, like that observed in the joint in PTOA. Our group has
now demonstrated that genetic deficiency of CD14 reduces pain and bone remodeling after joint injury in mice,
and prevents progression of arthritic cartilage damage. We hypothesize that CD14 receptor activation
promotes OA pain and pathology by enhancing inflammation and modifying osteoclast activity, and
anticipate that CD14 blockade can be developed as a therapeutic option to treat pain and inflammation
in OA. We will utilize in vitro techniques, small and large animal models of disease to understand how this
receptor can be effectively inhibited to reduce pain, inflammation and joint pathology. Specifically, in Aim 1 we
will use two complementary murine models of PTOA to determine how genetic deficiency of CD14 alters
patterns of pain, inflammation, and bone remodeling, and modifies osteoclast activity. We will use cell and
tissue culture along with imaging to identify the main cellular sources of CD14 in joint tissues. Finally, in Aim 2
we will test whether intra-articular inhibition of CD14 can reduce development of pain and progression of PTOA
in murine and porcine models of meniscal injury. This project will establish anti-CD14 therapy as safe and
effective in preclinical models of PTOA. As clinically-tested neutralizing anti-CD14 antibodies to interfere with
this pathway in humans are available, this will set the stage for translation to future clinical trials of this
approach in Veterans and others with OA."
10871887,"Discovery of biomarkers and their clinical validation is critically important for personalized medicine. For
glioblastoma (GBM), a uniformly lethal brain cancer, median survival is only 12-18 months with standard therapy.
In GBM, methylation of the DNA-repair enzyme MGMT gene promoter is an established prognostic epigenetic
biomarker which, while potentially critical to guide standard-of-care temozolomide (TMZ) therapy, is currently
underutilized. Further, the lack of correlation between MGMT promoter methylation status and treatment
response in some patients may be related to technical aspects of pre-analytical processing. Thus, there is an
unmet need for evidence-based knowledge of pre-analytical variables in order to establish standardized
protocols for the assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status in GBM.
 To study transcriptional and epigenetic alterations in disease, we developed PIXUL-ChIP for high-
throughput sample preparation and analysis of tissues. To facilitate sampling of frozen and FFPE tissues, we
developed the CryoCore Gun for extracting multiple small tissue cores. These tools provide a powerful integrated
platform for simultaneous processing and analysis of multiple small samples from individual tumors.
 Pre-analytical processing of biological samples profoundly impacts data output. However, the relative
importance of variables encountered during tissue collection, preservation, transport, storage, sampling and
analytic processing for the reliability of assessment of epigenetic cancer biomarkers (including GBM) has not
been rigorously examined. The goal of this U01 application is to define pre-analytical procedure variables
for GBM biospecimens in order to minimize ex-vivo MGMT promoter methylation changes while
preserving tissue integrity. The following aims are proposed.
 Aim1. To define the scope of intratumoral heterogeneity of GBM MGMT methylation and its
relation to histology to guide sampling needs in individual tumors.
 Aim2. To test effects of ex-vivo warm ischemia on GBM MGMT promoter methylation analysis and
histology.
 Aim3. To define the effects of tissue freezing/cryostorage/thawing on GBM MGMT promoter
methylation analysis and histology.
 Aim4. To define the effects of formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (FFPE) tissue preservation
on GBM MGMT promoter methylation analysis.
 Advances in biospecimen science are critical to facilitate the discovery and use of epigenetic biomarkers.
By interrogating standard variables associated with tissue collection, preservation, storage and sampling in a
clinically relevant GBM epigenetic assay, and through application of a novel device – CryoCore Gun – to sample
tumor heterogeneity, this proposal is highly aligned with the intent of the NCI Biospecimen Science U01 FOA."
10871889,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 1.5 million of the 44 million Blacks in the United States are carriers of the valine-to-isoleucine
substitution at position 122 (V122I) in the transthyretin (TTR) protein. Virtually exclusive to Blacks, this is the
most common cause of hereditary cardiac amyloidosis (hATTR-CA) worldwide. hATTR-CA leads to worsening
heart failure (HF) and premature death. Fortunately, new therapies that stabilize TTR improve morbidity and
mortality in hATTR-CA, especially when prescribed early in the disease.(5) However, hATTR-CA is often
diagnosed at an advanced stage and conventional diagnostic tools lack diagnostic specificity to detect early
disease. Recent work from the author demonstrated that young V122I TTR carriers had indirect imaging and
biomarker evidence of cardiac amyloid infiltration. Thus, the overall objectives of this proposal are to determine
the presence of subclinical hATTR-CA and to identify biomarkers that indicate amyloid progression in V122I TTR
carriers. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that hATTR-CA has a long latency period that will be detected
through subclinical amyloidosis imaging and biomarker phenotyping. The central hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing 2 specific aims: Aim 1) determine the association of V122I TTR carrier status with CMRI evidence of
amyloid infiltration; Sub-aim 1) determine the association of V122I TTR carrier status with cardiac reserve; Aim
2) determine the association between amyloid-specific biomarkers and V122I TTR carrier status; and Sub-aim
2) determine the association of amyloid-specific biomarkers with imaging-based parameters and evaluate their
diagnostic utility for identifying subclinical hATTR-CA. In Aim 1, CMRI will be used to compare metrics associated
with cardiac amyloid infiltration between a cohort of V122I TTR carriers without HF formed by cascade genetic
testing and age-, sex-, and race-matched non-carrier controls. For Sub-Aim 1, a sub-sample of carriers and non-
carrier controls enrolled in Aim 1 will undergo novel exercise CMRI to measure and compare cardiac systolic
and diastolic reserve. Aim 2 involves measuring and comparing amyloid-specific biomarkers in V122I TTR
carriers without HF with samples matched non-carriers (both from Aim 1) and individuals with symptomatic V122I
hATTR-CA from our clinical sites. These biomarkers detect and quantify different processes of TTR
amyloidogenesis and include circulating TTR, retinol binding protein 4, TTR kinetic stability, and misfolded TTR
oligomers. Sub-aim 2 will establish the role of these biomarkers to detect imaging evidence of subclinical hATTR-
CA disease. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it will
enroll a large population of V122I TTR carriers without HF through cascade genetic testing that will model clinical
care. Then, it will employ detailed, advanced imaging techniques with tissue characterization and novel
biomarkers that directly quantify processes of hATTR-CA disease progression to identify subclinical hATTR-CA.
Identifying evidence of cardiac amyloid progression prior to hATTR-CA disease onset will change how we think
about this disease and justify future research in screening and treatment strategies to prevent hATTR-CA."
10872291,"The aim of this project is to study why rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is an anticonvulsant state and to test whether stimulation of REM-promoting brain regions prevents seizures. Experiments will focus on the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPT), a midbrain cholinergic region that densely innervates the thalamus. Electrophysiological and optical recordings will be done in the thalamus, neocortex, and hippocampus in healthy and epileptic rats. The central motivating hypothesis is that REM is a neuroprotective state due to the wide-spread cortical asynchrony observed in this state which arises, in part, due to cholinergic signaling in the thalamus. Specific Aim 1.1 will test how electrical stimulation of the PPT affects acetylcholine binding in the thalamus and the firing patterns of cortical and thalamic neurons in healthy rats. These experiments will establish a database of how the brain reacts to different kinds of stimulations so that if a therapeutic protocol is discovered, its neurophysiological mechanism of action can be better understood. Specific Aim 1.2 will test 
whether these same stimulation protocols change the seizure threshold in the kindling model of epilepsy. I hypothesize that those stimulations that induce strong thalamic acetylcholine binding will also be those that induce cortical asynchrony and most effectively suppress seizure spread in the evoked kindling model. Specific Aim 2 will then test whether electrical stimulation of the PPT is effective in suppressing seizures in a chronic epilepsy model induced by intra-hippocampal kainic acid injection. Seizures will be predicted 
online, and stimulation of the PPT will be given when seizures are likely. These experiments will further our understanding of the link between seizures and sleep and will guide future clinical studies to assess whether REM promoting brain regions should be targeted in patients suffering from epilepsy."
10872319,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and
related dementias (ADRDs) is a challenge our society must address. While the future of healthcare availability
and quality of services seems uncertain, at the same time advances in pervasive computing and intelligent
embedded systems provides innovative strategies to meet these needs. One particular need which technology
can help address is assessment and assistance with a person's functional performance. The long-term goal of
this work is to develop technologies that will improve the independent functioning and quality of life of
individuals with functional limitations (particularly individuals with ADRDs) and reduce their reliance on
caregivers. The primary objective of this application is to develop a multi-modal sensor-based approach to
automate functional health assessment and assistance with everyday activities. Building on our prior
collaborative work, our approach will be to collect and fuse multi-modal functional performance data from
ambient sensors, mobile sensors, free text, and assessment apps (Aim 1). This fused “human behaviorome” will
provide a basis, together with observation-based ground truth, for automated functional assessment and
validation of each component technology, including the use of compensatory strategies, through in-person
observation and through video recording of typical daily activities and strategies (Aim 2). Finally, using
iterative, user-centered assessment of prompt-based assistance, we will evaluate the ability of activity
segmentation and forecasting techniques to provide automated support for activity initiation and accurate
completion of everyday activities (Aim 3). The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide
insights on functional health revealed within a person's everyday environment that have not been investigated
in prior work. The results can also help to extend functional independence through real-time assistance, while
the outcomes can assist family planning, provision of care, and design of real-world and lab-based measures of
functional performance. This work is important because of the increasing number of older individuals
experiencing cognitive and functional limitations due to chronic health conditions. Furthermore, they address
the need for individuals to remain functionally independent as long as possible in their own homes, thereby
improving quality of life and reducing health care costs."

People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at dramatically increased risk of developing coronary artery disease
(CAD), but the reasons for this excess risk compared to the background population are not fully understood.
There is a critical need to identify people at risk of major CAD events early in their T1D natural history and to
develop new therapeutic interventions to reduce CAD risk and burden. While prior studies have examined
associations between genetic variants and CAD in T1D, a lack of strong candidate genes remains. This lack is
at least partially due to the fact that case-control designs using low-precision phenotypes to maximize sample
size and which disregard within-phenotype heterogeneity have been the most common approach to studying
the genetic basis of vascular complications in T1D to date. Likewise, while it is well established that
inflammatory and immune response biomarkers are associated with CAD risk in general and that levels of
these biomarkers are elevated in T1D, the association between such markers and CAD has not been
comprehensively studied in T1D. Inflammatory and immune response biomarkers are intermediate phenotypes
that hold potential to help uncover novel pathways to CAD in T1D and may be promising treatment targets.
Thus, our hypotheses are that unidentified genetic variants associated with CAD susceptibility or resistance
exist and that networks of inflammatory and immune response biomarkers are associated with CAD and may
mediate inflammatory/immune response gene-CAD associations. Our approach will be to first refine the CAD
phenotype definition to one that better reflects the genetic etiology of CAD susceptibility and resistance in T1D.
Specifically, studying highly specific “discordant” risk factor-CAD phenotype subgroups may help uncover
novel pathways to CAD development in T1D. Our approach will increase precision of both genetic sequencing
(by using whole genome sequencing) and CAD phenotype definitions. We will also measure a comprehensive
proteomic panel of 92 targeted biomarkers and derive networks of related markers to assess their associations
with CAD and the degree to which those networks mediate associations between CAD and genes involved in
inflammation/immune response. We will utilize data and specimens from the Epidemiology of Diabetes
Complications (EDC) study, a well-characterized T1D cohort with >30 years of follow-up and deep
phenotyping, allowing us to comprehensively examine many intermediate phenotypes (i.e., traditional risk
factors and novel biomarkers) in gene-to-CAD pathways. Furthermore, we will replicate the findings from this
discovery analyses in external cohorts. With this approach we expect to uncover evidence of novel pathways
that account for a proportion of unexplained CAD risk in T1D and point to new intervention targets."
10873000,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our ability to hear relies on a small population of specialized sensory ‘hair’ cells in the inner ear that
cannot regenerate upon damage. Variants of over 100 human genes have been associated with deafness,
many of which alter the structure of the sensory organelle in hair cells, called the hair bundle. The hair bundle
consists of organized rows of graded-height membrane protrusions, or stereocilia, on the surface of hair cells.
Hair bundle formation during development and its precise architecture during life are vulnerable to a
variety of genetic, environmental, and age-related insults, all of which result in the decline or complete loss
of hearing ability. My overarching goal is to characterize protein interactions that are vital to the hair bundle’s
development and lifelong maintenance. In this proposal, I identify a new role for a calcium-binding
protein enriched in the mouse hair bundle, specifically, at the tip of the tallest stereocilia. A group of five
proteins, referred to as the Elongation Complex, was previously reported at this same compartment. Loss of
any member of this complex prevents proper stereocilia elongation, blurs the distinct identity of stereocilia
across rows, and results in profound deafness in both humans and mice. Interestingly, similar defects have
been reported in mouse mutants lacking key components of the mechanoelectrical transduction channel. This
suggests that, via transduction, active hair bundles somehow influence elongation factors, and thus
stereocilia dimensions. I propose that the calcium-binding protein studied in this proposal is a new binding
partner and regulator for MYO15A, the myosin motor that transports other Elongation Complex proteins to
stereocilia tips. MYO15A was one of the first proteins associated with hearing loss, and MYO15A mutations
are the third most common origin of heredity deafness in humans. Aim 1 of this proposal will determine the
relationship between MYO15A and our calcium-binding protein, and confirm preliminary results suggesting
that this new protein is essential for auditory function. Aim 2 will investigate how changes in calcium levels
in the hair bundle upon transduction affect the dynamic localization of our protein and its Elongation
Complex partners. Together, these aims identify and investigate this new stereocilia protein as an
additional member of the crucial Elongation Complex, and as a mediator that reads hair cell transduction
activity to influence stereocilia growth. This project employs cutting- edge mouse models, advanced
techniques to culture the auditory organ, and high-resolution imaging of preserved and live hair cells.
Completion of the project will contribute to my long-term goal of informing therapeutic strategies to ensure
the proper development and lifelong preservation of hair cells."
10873001,"Summary
Small-animal positron emission tomography (PET) has been widely used as a powerful tool for preclinical studies
to image a wide range of biological processes in vivo. The key parameters in PET are its spatial resolution and
sensitivity that determine the ability to image and quantify radiotracers in a small region of the subject at sub-
nanomolar concentrations. However, the applications of small-animal PET have been limited in its application
by a combination of spatial resolution and more importantly, the sensitivity, which hampers the use of PET for a
range of applications including imaging of low-levels of receptor and transgene expression, imaging of
therapeutic cell circulation and fast dynamic imaging to capture cardiac dynamics.
The main goal of this proposal is to develop a very high sensitivity total-body small-animal PET scanner
dedicated for ultra-low dose and fast dynamic applications for imaging mouse/rat disease models. The proposed
PET scanner will have 72 depth-of-interaction (DOI) detector modules arranged in 6 rings, with a ring diameter
of 160 mm and an axial length of 242 mm. The geometry of the proposed PET scanner is designed to cover the
whole body of the mouse/rat and to obtain high sensitivity and high resolution across the entire body.
Dual-ended readout detectors based on SiPMs coupled to both ends of bismuth germanate (BGO) will be used
to extract DOI information to maintain high and uniform spatial resolution across the whole field of view (FOV).
BGO is chosen due to its high stopping power, high photoelectric ratio, low cost and the most importantly its
negligible background radiation (which can significantly reduce the background events to benefit ultra-low dose
imaging). While lutetium-based scintillators have many attractive properties, a major limitation is the presence of
intrinsic background radiation, which is a significant barrier for ultra-low dose imaging.
Dedicated data acquisition electronics will be designed for the proposed scanner. Specifically, a novel analog
signal multiplexing readout method using Schottky diodes to block the noise of SiPMs with negligible signals will
be used to simplify the readout electronics and to improve the spatial resolution and the timing resolution, and a
shared-photodetector readout method will be used to identify all the crystals.
The outcome of this proposal will be a PET scanner will have a sensitivity >50% at the center of the FOV and a
sensitivity > 40% within the central 100 mm of the axial FOV. The resolution is predicted to be ~ 1 mm at the
center of the FOV and better than 1.5 mm across the entire FOV. The sensitivity is more than 4x better than
currently available small-animal PET scanners. It can potentially promote the use of total-body small-animal PET
for monitoring biological processes that result in very low source activities and expand the range of applications
for this powerful, non-invasive and translational imaging modality in preclinical applications. The PET scanner
developed in this proposal is also MRI-compatible and will support eventual integration inside an MRI scanner
for hybrid PET/MRI imaging."
10873002,"Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is more prevalent among veterans than nonveterans. Women comprise an
increasing proportion of military personnel and have a higher prevalence of arthritis than men. Thus, RA is a highly
relevant problem for the Veterans Administration (VA). In RA synovium, rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts
(RASFs) are hyper proliferated, the leading cell type in the terminal layer of the hyperplastic synovial tissue that
invades and degrades adjacent cartilage and bone. TRAF2 mediated activation of NF-B and JNK leads to
hyperproliferation of RASFs, chronic inflammation and the erosive arthritis which is the hallmark of RA. How NF-
B and JNK is activated in rheumatoid synovial fibroblast remains elusive, though studies have demonstrated that
the blockade of TNF mediated activation of NF-B and JNK attenuates the RA progression. However, a large
population of RA patients are non-response to anti-TNF therapy. Research from our group and others has shown
that exosomes released from rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts (RA-Exo) contribute to RA pathogenicity and
inflammation in several different animal models of joint disease, including RA. Exosomes are small cell derived
vesicles that are 30-100 nm in size and of endocytic origin. Exosomes released by exocytosis into the extracellular
space, where they are considered important drivers of intercellular communication. Exosomes in synovial fluid of
RA patients can lead to inflammation, degeneration of cartilage, and destruction of joints. However, exosomes in
synovial fluid could be released by different types of cells including RASFs in the synovium. Which cell types
release exosomes that contribute to joint inflammation and degeneration of cartilage is not well studied.
Of particular relevance to this proposal, we have demonstrated that RASF exosomes (RA-Exo) activate the TNF-
receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) mediated activation of the NF-B and JNK pathways is promoted by
stabilization of TRAF2. More importantly, our preliminary data clearly demonstrate that aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AhR) expression is significantly elevated in synovium from patients with RA. Expression positively correlates with
bone erosion and is localized with TRAF2, strongly supporting the relevance of this pathway in the pathogenesis
of RA in humans. Mechanistically, AhR is enriched in the RA-Exo and RA-Exo AhR is required for stabilizing
TRAF2. Our OVERALL HYPOTHESIS is that targeting AhR centered networks in RA-Exo leads to TRAF2
degradation, and the prevention of TRAF2 mediated activation of the NF-B and JNK pathways in RASFs.
Therefore, disruption of the AhR network in RA exosomes will eliminate/attenuate bone erosion and inflammation
by affecting RA-Exo mediated pathways contributing to the development of bone erosion in synovium of RA
patients.
Our plan to accomplish this objective are outlined in these three specific aims:
 1. Identify the RA-Exo AhR network that results in the development of arthritis in the mouse models.
 2. Determine whether RA-Exo AhR-associated kinase activity mediates dissociation of TRAF2AF
 from the TRAF2 complex.
 3. Determine whether blocking the recruitment of VCIP135 to RA-Exo AhR results in preventing the
 development of erosive arthritis in the huRASF/SCID mouse model.
The positive outcome of this study for future products would provide a basis for developing mechanism-driven novel
drugs for RA therapy. Moreover, it is of high value for predicting biomarkers from RA-Exo of non-responsive
individuals prior to commencing anti-TNF or personalized drug therapy."
10873156,"ABSTRACT: We propose to conduct research that will determine the impact of relevant behaviors on HIV
prevention among Young Black Sexual Minority Men (YBSMM), such as heavy cannabis use. Data from our
group and others demonstrate heavy cannabis use as prevalent and increasing in YBSMM community members,
is associated with HIV acquisition, use as a sex-drug, greater likelihood of membership in an HIV transmission
cluster, and decreased HIV testing. We propose to explore mechanisms, specifically neurocognitive impacts of
heavy cannabis use, linking heavy cannabis use to HIV prevention outcomes, and whether motivations for
cannabis use, amidst a changing cannabis regulatory, social acceptance and legal landscape, modify its effects
on HIV prevention. In the proposed study, we will rigorously examine links between heavy cannabis use,
neurocognition, sex behavior and PrEP care engagement. First, we will elucidate the effects of cannabis use on
neurocognition - specifically, brain systems supporting risk/reward (RR) processing, as well as higher order
organizational functions collectively referred to as executive function (EF) in YBSMM. Second, we will explore
how cannabis use, directly and via neurocognitive impacts, is associated with HIV prevention, and particularly
PrEP care engagement (primary outcome). The proposed study will integrate and expand these lines of research
within the context of traditional health department and CDC supported HIV prevention programs that engage
YBSMM in the South Side of Chicago and adjacent suburbs, home to the largest contiguous majority Black
population in the US. We will use rigorous objective measures to assess cannabis use (e.g., quantification of
cannabis metabolites in plasma), neurocognition (e.g., neuroimaging) and PrEP outcomes (e.g., EMR measured
persistence), and triangulate that data using validated survey measures. We will also rigorously account for other
substance use, as a proportion of YBSMM who use cannabis also use other substances (e.g., alcohol), and
there is increasing recognition of the need to study substance use as it occurs in real-world settings, including
polysubstance use. We will assess these factors longitudinally over 1.5 years (3 times 9 months apart) in a
cohort of 280 YBSMM living without HIV, to permit examination of within-individual biological changes and the
dynamic nature of cannabis use and its association with prevention care outcomes. We aim to: 1) Determine
cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between cannabis use and neurocognition (i.e., neural response
to risk/reward processing and executive function) in a cohort of YBSMM; 2) Evaluate overall, direct and indirect
(via neurocognition) associations between cannabis use and PrEP care (e.g., persistence [primary]) and HIV
transmission behaviors (e.g., group sex [secondary]); and 3) Determine whether motivations for cannabis use
modify associations between cannabis use and HIV prevention outcomes. Identifying neurocognitive
mechanisms through which cannabis use affects HIV prevention and the importance of motivations for cannabis
use in understanding clinical outcomes will provide targets for future HIV prevention efforts."

Misfolding and aggregation of mutant huntingtin exon1 (mHTTex1) promotes neurodegeneration in Huntington’s
disease (HD). The intrinsically disordered mHTTex1 misfolds into a heterogeneous mixture of assemblies,
however, how they form, and which conformers mediate neurotoxicity in vivo remain to be identified. This gap in
knowledge is due to a lack of molecular diagnostic tools to study the oligomerization pathway of native mHTTex1
in live neurons and to determine how it may induce neurodegeneration. Conformer-specific nanobodies will
enable us to perform these studies. Nanobodies are genetically encoded variable heavy domains (VHH), which
are naturally produced by camelids and sharks and display potent specificity towards target antigens. This project
will combine the experience of Dr. Langen’s lab in generating defined and stable helical oligomers and protofibrils
of recombinant mHTTex1, with the that of Dr. Khoshnan’s lab in nanobody technology and its application to
studies on the neurobiology of mHTTex1. We recently reported that among the various assemblies of
recombinant mHTTex1, protofibrils and their precursors helical oligomers are neuroinvasive since they can
penetrate human neurons, propagate, and induce nuclear damage. Towards identifying similar conformers in
vivo, we now have isolated llama nanobodies, which bind to helical oligomers, and protofibrils of recombinant
mHTTex1. We plan to investigate the binding properties of these nanobodies and develop diagnostic tools like
chromobodies by fusing them to GFP or RFP. These biosensors will be used to study the early steps of native
mHTTex1 oligomerization in live human neuronal stem-cell derived neurons, and examine whether helical
oligomers and/or protofibrils are neurotoxic. Nanobodies, which may inhibit the oligomerization of mHTTex1, will
be tested for ability to prevent aggregation and toxicity in the same model. This project has the potential to make
a significant contribution to our understanding of mHTTex1 oligomerization and neurotoxicity in a physiologically
relevant model, identify therapeutic modalities, and provide a set of novel molecular diagnostic tools for the
broader HD research community."
10869802,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Air pollution is an emerging environmental risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Air pollution
consists of a complex mix of gases, hydrocarbons, metals, and particulate matter, the specific make-up of which
varies according to the source of the pollution. Further, different air pollution components have variable
neurotoxicity profiles and could have additive or synergistic impacts on the developing brain. Given the
increasing prevalence of NDDs, there is urgent need for in vivo models that enable rapid risk assessment of
different air pollution types to determine their impact on neurodevelopment. Additionally, NDDs often have
complex etiologies involving both environmental and genetic risk factors, making it critical to evaluate different
air pollutants in the context of genetic susceptibilities. We aim to establish the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster,
as a model for neurotoxicity profiling of air pollution because of its established utility in inhalation toxicity studies,
genetic tractability, conservation of human NDD risk genes, and suite of low-cost rapid behavioral paradigms for
experimental endpoints. To establish our model, we will use one specific source of air pollution: diesel exhaust
(DE). Laboratory and epidemiological studies of DE have demonstrated its ability to impair neurodevelopment in
organisms ranging from insects to humans. Thus, using DE to establish our model will allow us to determine
effective exposure parameters to elicit phenotypic responses and delineate associated metabolite markers of
neurotoxicity in the fly. In Aim I, we will vary the developmental stage (embryonic and larval) and DE dose (25,
100, 300, and 900 µg/m3) administered to wild-type Drosophila using a DE generator and inhalation chamber.
We will assess the response to both whole DE (particulate- and gas-phase) and filtered DE (gas-phase only) by
measuring: (1) two neurodevelopmentally programmed behaviors: adult courtship behavior and larval locomotor
activity, and (2) primarily endogenous chemical metabolites in larvae and adults from each exposure condition.
We expect to develop an effective DE exposure protocol, determine the impacts of DE on two innate Drosophila
behaviors, measure metabolites associated with neurotoxicity, and parse the differential impact of filtered and
unfiltered DE. In Aim II, we will use the exposure parameters established in Aim I to examine gene-environment
impacts of DE in a Drosophila model of fragile X syndrome (FXS), which have null mutations in fragile X mental
retardation 1 (dfmr1). Dfmr1 is the ortholog of human FMR1, which causes FXS and is the most common
monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder. We will expose FXS flies to two doses of filtered and unfiltered
DE and compare the impact to control strains. Because FXS flies have significant defects in courtship, locomotor,
and grooming activity, we will examine all three innate behaviors as endpoints. We will again perform metabolic
profiling of larvae and adults from each exposure condition. This research will contribute to our understanding of
DE as an NDD risk factor and establish Drosophila as a model for rapid neurotoxicity testing of different air
pollution types, including assessment of gene-environment interactions relevant to NDDs."

Formaldehyde is a naturally occurring metabolite found in all cell types. Although it has been implicated in human
disease including dementia and diabetes, it has also shown to have critical roles in beneficial processes such as
memory formation and purine biosynthesis. In methylotrophic bacteria, one-carbon metabolites such as
methanol can serve as growth substrates in pathways where formaldehyde is an obligate central intermediate.
Due to its high chemical reactivity, formaldehyde balance in these organisms is critical; however, their
formaldehyde stress response systems have remained elusive. EfgA and TtmR are central players of two distinct
systems that modulate formaldehyde resistance and disrupt formaldehyde homeostasis in the methylotroph
Methylorubrum (formerly Methylobacterium) extorquens. EfgA is a newly identified conserved formaldehyde
sensor that halts growth and translation in response to elevated formaldehyde levels. TtmR is a MarR-family
transcription factor that regulates many genes involved in regulation, signaling, and stress response, including
efgA. Our work will characterize the EfgA and TtmR homeostasis systems to understand how cells sense and
respond to formaldehyde levels to prevent otherwise inevitable cellular damage. Specifically, we will employ
unbiased sequencing-based approaches and experimental evolution to home in on the mechanisms of these
systems and define their regulation. Formaldehyde-mediated cellular damage is a readout of the status of
formaldehyde homeostasis; however, the in vivo reactivity of formaldehyde is poorly understood. Our data
suggests that protein damage is the predominant cause of cytotoxicity in M. extorquens. We will use proteomics
approaches to define the impact of formaldehyde on the proteome and identify cellular strategies for
counteracting formaldehyde-induced protein damage. Through this work, we will leverage a model bacterium
that is well adapted to maintain formaldehyde homeostasis to explore the burgeoning field of formaldehyde
regulatory biology. The results from this work will define essential cellular processes and has implications for
analogous homeostasis systems for toxic metabolites. We envision this work will have substantial impacts on
the understanding of how cells sense and regulate formaldehyde levels, how cells navigate and avoid
accumulation of toxic metabolites generally, and how metabolite-specific and global systems of stress response
intersect to provide balanced cellular metabolism and growth."

necessary to solve important and complex biological problems that can be most effectively addressed by
studies at the chemistry-biology interface. We are focusing on the mechanistic chemistry of biomolecules that
have implications for impacting human health and treatment of disease. This is a theme that is of interest to a
significant population of students on campus and serves as an excellent system for the application of tools at
the chemistry-biology interface to solve important biological problems. The program creates a group of
chemists and biologists who can speak the same language and thereby function effectively in multidisciplinary
teams. The Program involves 34 participating faculty from two separate Schools within the University of
Pennsylvania, The Perelman School of Medicine (SOM) and The School of Arts and Sciences (SAS).
Participating students come primarily from two graduate groups that span institution and school boundaries,
the Graduate Group in Chemistry (CHEM, in SAS) and the Graduate Group in Biochemistry and Molecular
Biophysics (BMB, in SOM). To ensure that students carry out research within the scope of the training
program, students are selected for the program after they have chosen a thesis laboratory and project and
generally in their second year. To ensure chemistry-biology interface training and cross-fertilization between
the chemistry and biology students that participate in the program, students participate in the following
activities: (1) research at the chemistry-biology interface, (2) didactic course-work dealing with the chemistry
and biology of proteins, nucleic acids and small biomolecules, including a literature-based component, (3) an
annual student-run Chemical Biophysics mini-symposia series, (4) twice monthly student luncheons, (5) an
annual Chemistry-Biology Interface retreat, (6) an annual mid-Atlantic Frontiers at the Chemistry-Biology

10873302,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Influenza infection increases the incidence of acute MI (AMI) within the first 7 days after detection and
the therapeutic benefit of vaccination is comparable to current therapies for secondary prevention of AMI.
Platelets are the blood component central to thrombosis and uncontrolled platelet activation is a major contributor
to unstable coronary syndromes and AMI. Although thrombotic events have been associated with some viral
infections, the molecular mechanisms underlining platelet mediated thrombosis during progression of global viral
infection such as influenza have not been established. The major objective of this proposal is to examine the
role of a previously undescribed molecular mechanism in platelets that leads to sensing of influenza and
ultimately increased thrombosis. The mechanism of reference involves a cytoplasmic receptor known as the
retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) receptor and its downstream signaling cascade. Preliminary results show
that RIG-I and proteins related to RIG-I molecular signaling become specifically upregulated in platelets from
influenza infected patients. Since platelets are anucleated the upregulated expression of RIG-I suggests direct
involvement of their precursors the megakaryocytes (MKs) during infection. For that purpose, we will also study
the contribution of RIG-I in MKs to platelet reprogramming toward more efficient viral response that may lead to
thrombosis. Considering that the RIG-I-signaling axis is present in platelets and specifically upregulated, we
hypothesize that during infection, platelets sense influenza through the RIG-I signaling axis leading to their
activation and MKs reprogram platelets toward an increased antiviral and thrombotic response. Thus, we
propose two specific aims of research: Aim 1. To determine the expression and activity of the RIG-I axis in
platelets with respect to their antiviral and/or thrombotic responses; and Aim 2. To characterize how MKs sense
influenza and how this sensing subsequently reprograms the RIG-I/MAVS pathway, leading to enhanced
expression of antiviral and prothrombotic genes. Building upon novel observations obtained in preliminary
studies, our proposed research plan will determine the role of a previously unknown signaling pathway in
platelets, RIG-I/MAVS, in mediating influenza antiviral and thrombotic responses. The outcome of this proposal
will define the fundamental mechanisms of platelet viral cytosolic signaling, MK response to infection, how this
synergistic response contributes to immunity and thrombosis, and how targeting this pathway could ameliorate
thrombotic and infectious disease pathologies."

Severe COVID-19 induces strong alterations in the peripheral immune system. Some immune cell types take
on a protective role in this disease, while others contribute to disease pathology. One cell type whose
functional role in COVID-19 is not yet known is the natural killer (NK) cell. I previously demonstrated that NK
cells, which can mediate antiviral activity, are strongly altered by severe COVID-19. I have also generated
preliminary data demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 modulates the expression of ligands for the NK cell activating
receptor NKG2D and allows infected cells to avoid NK cell killing; however, the mechanisms underlying this
remain unexplored. Moreover, although the NK cells of COVID-19 patients are poor mediators of cytotoxicity
against tumor target cells, the functional responses of NK cells from COVID-19 patients to
SARS-CoV-2-infected cells have not been examined. The proposed research seeks to resolve these critical
gaps in our knowledge of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 by investigating the mechanisms underlying
the phenotype and function of NK cells in COVID-19. To do this, I will 1) Define the mechanisms by which
SARS-CoV-2 modulates NK cell responses; 2) Characterize the functional responses of NK cells from
COVID-19 patients with a wide range of disease severities against target cells infected with SARS-CoV-2; and
3) Elucidate the role of monocyte-NK cell crosstalk in driving NK cell exhaustion in severe COVID-19. I
hypothesize that the experiments described in my proposal will show that prolonged stimulation of peripheral
NK cells by monocytes contributes to exhaustion in the NK cells of severe COVID-19 patients, driving poor
functional responses against SARS-CoV-2-infected target cells that are exacerbated by immune evasion
mechanisms mediated by SARS-CoV-2. To test this hypothesis, I will utilize NK cells and monocytes from a
large cohort of COVID-19 patients with disease severities ranging from mildly symptomatic to fatal. I will
perform functional assays that test the responses of these NK cells against target cells infected with
replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 in Stanford’s BSL3 facilities. I will also assess the ability of monocytes from
severe COVID-19 patients to induce activation and exhaustion in healthy NK cells by establishing a co-culture
system with these two cell types. Overall, my experiments will uncover the basis for the NK cell phenotype
observed in COVID-19, the effects of this phenotype on NK cell responses to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, and
the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 modulates the susceptibility of infected cells to NK cell cytotoxicity.
Thoroughly interrogating the responses of NK cells to SARS-CoV-2 will help to determine whether the role of
NK cells in COVID-19 is protective or pathological and will further our collective understanding of NK cell
biology. Moreover, the identification of receptors involved in the modulation of NK cell activation will inform the
development of therapeutic strategies for COVID-19."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial disease that leads to profound
neurodegeneration, cognitive decline, and eventually death. There is strong evidence that the
Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) is an important driver of the disease. However, the
mechanisms by which Aβ is toxic are not defined.
There is increasing evidence that inflammation and vascular abnormalities contribute to AD
pathology. One pathway that links these two processes is the plasma contact system. We have
found that this system can be initiated by Aβ and is activated in AD plasma from human patients
and mouse models. Furthermore, inhibition of the contact system in AD mice improves their
pathology and cognition.
We propose to further define how the contact system and its components, specifically high
molecular weight kininogen (HK) and coagulation factor XII (FXII), contribute to AD
pathophysiology. We have found that Aβ protofibrils are the most effective Aβ species to
activate the contact system. Aβ protofibrils are also the main target of lecanemab, the promising
new FDA-approved antibody therapy for AD patients. We will investigate how lecanemab might
interfere with the contact system to generate its beneficial effects in humans and determine if
both lecanemab and a contact system inhibitor could have a synergistic effect on AD pathology.
We will also study the structural interaction between Aβ protofibrils, HK, and FXII to determine
mechanistically how Aβ causes contact system dysfunction in AD. Finally, we will explore the
potential of an anti-HK antibody as a new therapeutic avenue for AD."

Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) use in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is
increasing exponentially. Despite this, mortality rates remain high. A likely explanation is that VA-ECMO
increases myocardial workload by increasing left ventricular (LV) afterload. Without mechanistic insight,
physicians are empirically using additional devices to mitigate afterload, with associated increase in cost and
adverse events. A critical barrier in the field is our lack of understanding of how VA-ECMO alters afterload and
what interventions may mitigate these effects. In this proposal, we use the four-component model of afterload
as arterial impedance, resistance, compliance and wave reflection to fully define how VA-ECMO changes
afterload in an innovative and highly translational animal model of VA-ECMO in AMI. In exciting preliminary
data, we identified a persistent increase in impedance after activation of VA-ECMO, which may represent a
potential therapeutic target. Our central hypothesis is that VA-ECMO increases impedance through early wave
reflection and that reducing early wave reflection will limit increases in ventricular work and myocardial injury
imparted by VA-ECMO. To test this hypothesis, we will use our highly translational preclinical model of AMI to
1) determine how ventricular-arterial coupling is altered by VA-ECMO in the presence of cardiac dysfunction,
2) test whether pharmacologic or VA-ECMO device-based strategies can reduce impedance, LV work and
myocardial injury, and 3) test whether concomitant use of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation reduces
impedance and myocardial injury due to VA-ECMO. These results will define the mechanisms by which VA-
ECMO mediates afterload, identify novel strategies to limit increases in LV work and myocardial injury in VA-
ECMO and provide critically needed mechanistic and highly translational insight into management of patients
requiring VA-ECMO, with the ultimate goal to improve outcomes in AMI associated cardiogenic shock.
Together with Dr. Everett’s quantitative medical engineering and cardiology background, scientific and career
development mentorship from Dr. Navin Kapur and innovative Advisory Committee of physician-scientists, the
fertile and supportive environment of the Tufts CardioVascular Center and Molecular Cardiology Research

 Continuous functional T and B lymphoid output is critical to overall health and life, as delayed and reduced
lymphopoietic output has been associated with serious illness and even mortality. The lymphoid system is
particularly sensitive to hematopoietic perturbation, both in the context of steady state and regeneration.
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) into irradiated recipients and stress from infection or other insults
in native hematopoietic systems have been shown to negatively regulate lymphoid output. One of the challenges
to developing clinical therapies to restore healthy immune function is that we don’t have enough information on
lymphoid development in vivo. This is true for both the embryonic immune system which hPSC blood
differentiation systems attempt to reproduce and the adult immune system. Understanding the mechanisms by
which lymphoid output from HSPCs is controlled at clonal, transcriptional, and epigenetic levels is critical for
revealing how lymphoid output is established and regulated in steady state, how it is suppressed with
regeneration, and whether there is a specific signature associated with reduced lymphoid output that is
conserved between native and non-native systems. It was recently shown that the HSC specific transcription
factor Tcf15 is indispensable for long term self-renewal, following HSCT. Intriguingly, I have demonstrated that
Tcf15 also negatively regulates both T and B lymphoid differentiation. This was true both in native hematopoiesis
and regeneration. It is well established that HSCs display multilineage priming. This allows HSCs to readily
regenerate the hematopoietic system, upon perturbation and to differentiate into lineage restricted progenitor
cells to meet native hematopoietic demands. In addition, reduced lymphoid lineage priming has been shown to
promote HSC expansion. For the mentored K99 phase of this proposal, I will transition from a focus on Tcf15 in
native hematopoiesis, to a focus on Tcf15 in lymphopoiesis, a focus that will allow me to establish research
independence from my mentor. With the evidence of multilineage HSC priming, the evidence of native
antagonism between HSC self-renewal and lymphoid differentiation programs, and my preliminary data
hypothesize that Tcf15 expression attenuates lymphoid lineage priming in HSCs and that this is conserved
between steady state and regeneration. I propose to test this hypothesis in two aims: In Aim 1, I will apply scRNA-
seq, scATAC-seq, and proteomic analyses to elucidate the transcriptional and epigenetic program by which
Tcf15 regulates T and B lymphoid differentiation from HSPCs. In Aim 2, I will use Tcf15 reporter and CRISPR-
based lineage tracing (CARLIN) mouse models generated in our lab to explore the effect of endogenous Tcf15
on T and B cell specification from HSCs. For the R00 component of this award, I will seek to continue my
examination of regulation of lymphoid lineage priming, but downstream of HSCs, exploring whether I can apply
lineage and transcriptional tracing methods to retroactively connect T and B cell differentiation outcomes to
distinct lympho-myeloid primed progenitors (LMPP) identities in health and age, in an unbiased manner."

The role of tumor-macrophage hybrid cells in prostate cancer metastasis
AR signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) are commonly used to treat recurrent prostate cancer whose growth depends on
AR activities. However, ARSIs can result in selective pressure, transitioning AR-dependent tumors to AR-
independent tumors. Extensive studies have revealed signal-switching mechanisms by which ARSIs exert the
phenotypic transition leading to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Apart from these
signaling circumventions, here we propose that tumor-macrophage hybrid (TMH) cells are a novel cellular
contributor to mCRPC. Our preliminary data suggest that TMH cells adopt macrophages' characteristics to evade
immune surveillance and withstand hemodynamic stress in the vasculature for distant colonization. In addition,
TMH cells intrinsically express very low AR/AR-targets, resembling an adenocarcinoma-immune subtype of
mCRPC that resists ARSIs. Three specific aims will use systems-level approaches to mechanistically define the
role of TMH cells in mCRPC. In Aim 1, we will demonstrate that TMH cells leverage abundant c-Myc from parental
cancer cells to upregulate M1/M2 polarization loci derived from parental macrophages. This unique transcription
machinery, not observed in either parental cells, is being exploited to confound the host immune system, thereby
enhancing the immunoevasive features of TMH cells. In this regard, c-Myc acts as an immunoevasive driver, not
primarily as an oncogenic driver per se, in TMH cells. In Aim 2, we will show that as a result of cellular fusions,
TMH cells undergo transcriptomic rewiring of the AR cistrome, leading to treatment resistance of ARSIs.
Consequently, these cells overtake AR-dependent cancer cell populations for malignant outgrowth. In Aim 3, we
will evaluate whether integrin-mediated mechanotransduction in TMH cells strengthens their resistance to fluid
shear stress in blood circulation. The signaling cascade enhances a mesenchymal feature of TMH cells, endowing
them with higher viability and motility than circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Therefore, our proposed study highlights
an overlooked cell-intrinsic factor contributing to mCRPC. Furthermore, enumeration and molecular profiling of
TMH cells represent a new type of liquid biopsy for prostate cancer patients."
10870441,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Disruptions in neuronal development and connectivity within the neocortex, the area of the brain responsible for
high cognitive function, are found in many neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum
disorders, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia. What causes this atypical development is still poorly
understood, but likely includes a combination of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, including
maternal nutrition. We thus propose to study how genetic, epigenetic, and maternal nutrition factors intersect to
regulate two major developmental convergence points for NDDs: the proliferation and differentiation of neuronal
progenitors, and the establishment of appropriate local and long-distance neuronal connections. To investigate
these mechanisms, we will employ Cited2 forebrain-specific conditional knockout (cKO) mice, which our previous
work demonstrated have disruptions in these conversion points of neocortical development, and display
behavioral abnormalities associated with human NDDs. CITED2 is a transcriptional co-regulator that recruits the
histone acetyltransferase complex CBP/p300, thus Cited2 loss-of-function (LOF) leads to disruptions in the
epigenome and alterations in the transcriptome. Importantly, maternal folic acid supplementation rescues neural
tube closure defects in Cited2-null embryos; whether it also modifies neocortical phenotypes is unknown
although maternal folic acid supplementation in humans is associated with reduced risk of NDDs. We
hypothesize that maternal folic acid supplementation will rescue the atypical neocortical development and
behavior in Cited2 cKO mice. We propose to test this hypothesis by examining regulation of progenitor
proliferation and differentiation, precise axonal connectivity, and behavior in Cited2 cKO and wildtype littermates,
with sufficient vs. supplemented maternal folic acid diets (Aim 1). Folic acid is a methyl donor and alters DNA
methylation, an important epigenetic modification associated with gene silencing. Thus, to determine whether
the alteration of neocortical development with folic acid occurs due to modification of gene regulatory networks
disrupted with Cited2 LOF directly, or whether compensatory pathways are modified, we propose to employ
antibody-based fluorescence activated cell sorting to purify Cited2 cKO and wildtype neocortical intermediate
progenitor cells (IPCs) at E15.5, with both sufficient and supplemented maternal FA, and perform RNA-seq and
Methyl-seq (Aim 2). Together, these approaches have the potential to identify entirely novel genes and pathways
underpinning gene x environment interactions controlling neocortical development, and to open new avenues
for investigation."
10870500,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Preeclampsia (PE) is a relatively common pregnancy disorder that originates from the placenta. It affects
up to 8% of all human pregnancies and causes various maternal and fetal health problems, including
maternal vascular dysfunction, proteinuria, and hypertension as well as growth restriction and preterm birth
of the baby. It has no cure other than the delivery of the baby and can lead to eclampsia, which may result
in death via stroke. It is generally accepted that defects in trophoblast lineage development, critical for
proper implantation and placentation, are the leading cause of PE. However, the underlying molecular
mechanisms of PE have not been well understood. While many genes upregulated or downregulated in
PE have been identified by global gene expression analysis, upstream key transcription factors (TFs)
responsible for the PE-specific gene expression programs (PE-driver TFs) and their action mechanisms
have not yet been described. Furthermore, how such PE-driver TFs disrupt normal trophoblast lineage-
specific gene regulatory networks remains unknown. The objectives of the proposed studies are to identify
transcriptional and epigenetic regulators modulating PE-specific gene expression programs and to
understand their action mechanisms by utilizing recently established human trophoblast stem cells (TSC)
and their in vitro differentiation into syncytiotrophoblast (ST) and extravillous trophoblast (EVT) as a model
system. Our preliminary studies suggested that the untimely or sustained upregulation of sequence-
specific TFs may trigger abnormal expression of target genes known to be PE-specific, which may lead to
impaired ST/EVT differentiation and, ultimately, PE phenotypes. To understand the molecular basis of PE,
we will 1) identify and functionally validate putative PE-driver TFs which can induce PE-specific gene
expression programs by utilizing human TSC differentiation as a model and 2) understand the regulatory
mechanisms PE-driver TFs by mapping their downstream target genes and interaction partner proteins.
The successful completion of this proposal will provide us with new models for studying the
pathophysiology of human PE, illumination of molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying PE, and thus
enhance our ability to generate novel diagnostic tools and therapeutics to improve healthcare for both the
women with PE and their babies in the near future."
10873215,"The goal of this mentored career development award is to enable the candidate’s transition to independence
as a physician-scientist studying the connection between plasticity, sleep and stroke. The candidate is an MD,
PhD sleep neurologist with a background in engineering, human sleep electrophysiology and how it relates to
brain plasticity. The award will help the candidate gain experience in basic genetic, molecular and in-vivo
imaging techniques as well as an in-depth knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in
plasticity mediated neuronal repair. This award will help the candidate to become an independent physician
scientist using sleep as way to accelerate the pace of scientific discovery and its application to the care of
individuals with neurological disease. This career development award brings together three experts covering the
diverse fields of sleep (Landsness – PI), plasticity of brain recovery (Lee – Mentor) and optical neuroimaging
(Culver – Mentor) to tackle this innovative concept and potentially open-up a new field of research. The research
environment in which this career development award is proposed is outstanding. Dr. Jin Moo Lee, a translational
neuroscientist and vascular neurologist with an interest in the plasticity of stroke recovery, has a long track record
of both scientific and mentorship success. Dr. Joe Culver, is a long-time collaborator of the Lee lab and highly
experienced in the imaging techniques the candidate will use. Finally, the Washington University neuroscience
community emphasizes high quality research, career development of young faculty and collaboration, all keys
to his success.
 An objective of this proposal is to understand the role of slow wave sleep (SWS) in repair and recovery after
focal ischemic brain injury. Local SWS is critical for learning-related brain plasticity. Mechanisms involved in
brain plasticity have been postulated to be necessary for successful neural repair and recovery after brain injury.
Neuronal activity in somatostatinergic interneurons (SOMi) has recently been shown to critically mediate SWS.
We propose to 1) determine the role of global SWS in a mouse model of brain repair following focal ischemia
(photothrombosis) in somatosensory cortex and 2) locally manipulate SWS (via SOMi using chemogenetics) to
determine if modulating local SWS affects cortical remapping, synaptogenesis, and sensorimotor recovery.
 If the hypothesis is correct, it will show that locally manipulating SWS can selectivity drive plasticity and
ultimately recovery from stroke. It will also determine if SOMi might be amenable to targeting and may help
shape a novel therapeutic approach to enhancing plasticity and recovery following stroke. This career
development award is the ideal platform for the candidate to acquire important training in basic research
techniques, deepen his understanding of the role SWS in repair and recovery of stroke, and will launch him
towards an independent research career focused on using sleep to aid in care of individuals suffering from stroke."

The UCSC Graduate Training Program in Genome Science combines cutting-edge computational biology
training in a multidisciplinary biomedical science and engineering environment. Among other strengths, UC
Santa Cruz is a world leader in computational biology, bioinformatics, genomic technologies and RNA biology.
The goals of the program are to prepare trainees for advanced academic and industry careers in biomedical
genomics. Our training program develops critical thinking skills, provides rigorous hands-on training in computer
science, statistics, and biological sciences, and develops scientific communication skills.
The proposed program will provide support for six trainees, each with a two-year appointment. Our trainee
applicant pool consists of PhD students who have already joined UCSC’s interdisciplinary genomics and
biomedical sciences community and completed three hands-on laboratory rotations during their first year of
study, at least one of which must be conducted in the laboratory of a GS Program faculty member.
Genome Science trainees participate in several innovative training activities. Each year, our trainees will
organize and run a bootcamp for each year’s incoming PhD cohort of students who are accepted by the Dept.
of Biomolecular Engineering. This 10-day activity is designed and implemented by the T32 trainees with
feedback and guidance from faculty. The centerpiece of the bootcamp is an ambitious hands-on activity for the
incoming grad cohort to tackle. Previous activities have included building a functional DropSeq single-cell RNA
sequencing machine (2017), as well as genome sequencing and assembly of the banana slug – UCSC’s mascot
(2019). Trainees receive training in labs of 26 faculty, including a winner of the MacArthur Award, members of
the National Academy of Sciences, and a Nobel Laureate. Formal coursework for trainees includes graduate-
level instruction in bioethics, programming, practical genomics, statistics, and scientific writing. These courses
cover essential topics in rigor and reproducibility and responsible conduct of research. Working with the Graduate
Advising Committee and their faculty mentors, trainees develop Individual Development Plans which may involve
further coursework to address specific deficiencies or special interests. In coordination with the NHGRI DAP
program, trainees will also serve as mentors to undergraduate students.
Program success will be assessed via several quantitative metrics of trainee productivity, such as the timing
and number of publications and success in applying for extramural research funds, as well as career outcomes
that are tracked following the award of PhDs. These metrics will be assessed by the Genome Sciences
Executive Committee.
The program is interdisciplinary, including 26 program faculty from 8 departments. Most trainees and
approximately half of program faculty are affiliated with the Biomolecular Engineering Department, as nearly all
BME faculty have genomics-focused research programs."
10873220,"In response to PAR-19-294 (Early-Stage Preclinical Validation of Therapeutic Leads for Diseases of Interest to
the NIDDK), we propose to conduct preclinical validation of carbon monoxide (CO) as a therapeutic agent for
treating acute kidney injury (AKI), which afflicts a large number of patients with serious and sometimes fatal
consequences. Currently, there are no treatment options available other than maintenance therapy. Therefore,
developing disease modifying treatment for AKI will address an important, unmet medical need. The proposed
work of developing CO-based therapeutics is based on CO’s endogenous signaling roles, the availability of a
large amount of literature evidence to show CO’s cyto- and organ-protective effects, our unique chemistry work
to pack “CO in a pill” through innovative prodrug design for easy delivery through pharmaceutically acceptable
forms, and our own extensive preliminary results in demonstrating the organ-protective effects of such CO
prodrugs in animal models of kidney ischemia reperfusion injury and rhabdomyolysis injuries, liver injury,
systemic inflammation, and GI inflammation such as the colon and stomach, among others. In this application,
we propose to examine some key preclinical validation issues and aim to produce one or more lead compounds
ready for IND-enabling work by the end of the grant period. A very important aspect is our plan to use multiple
animal models including the examination in large animals such as pig to conduct the pharmacological
assessment, which should give enhanced chance of success when translating into human. Specifically, we
propose to pursue the following specific aims (1) design, synthesis, and assessment of CO prodrugs, (2)
therapeutic validation of CO prodrug efficacy in mouse models of AKI, and (3) therapeutic validation of CO
prodrugs in pig models of AKI. The proposed work will bridge the gap between our long-term goal of developing
CO-based therapeutics and the need for preclinical assessments. Upon completion of the project, we will have
developed and fully validated the efficacy of a series of innovative CO prodrugs that can either deliver CO
systemically or selectively target the kidney and allow for renal enrichment. Further, we will also have developed
a pipeline for backup candidates. Collectively, the proposed work will be a major step in developing CO-based
therapeutics against AKI and other forms of organ injury."

The gut microbiome, mucosal immune cells and HIV-1 virions influence each other's functions through intimate
and multifaceted interactions that determine disease outcomes in infected individuals. In this multi-PI proposal,
we will test the central hypothesis that HIV-1 infection causes a profound disruption of the mucosal immune
system, which does not resolve following the initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). By
interrupting key signals between the microbiota and the host's immune system, HIV-1 elicits profound intestinal
immune alterations that cause dysbiosis. This latter triggers a self-perpetuating, maladaptive feedback loop
that impairs the regulation of viral quasispecies, promotes intestinal persistence of HIV-1 virions and, in a
subset of patients, causes suboptimal immunological reconstitution following initiation of cART. The aims of
this research program will be achieved through a unique collaborative effort involving three highly
complementary groups. Dr. Saurabh Mehandru, PI, is a trained gastroenterologist with more than 15 years of
experience in the field of HIV-1 infection and several key contributions on its impact in mucosal immunity. He
will recruit infected subjects, obtain gut tissue, and profile intestinal and systemic immune populations along
with HIV-1 reservoirs in the gut (Aim 1). Dr. Andrea Cerutti, Co-PI, is a world-renowned expert in the biology of
mucosal B cells from both healthy and HIV-1-infected individuals. He will study intestinal IgA responses in the
HIV-1-infected gut mucosa, focusing on the B cell ontogeny, clonotypic architecture and bacterial reactivity of
IgA1 and IgA2 subclasses. He will also define the impact of unbalanced IgA1 and IgA2 responses on microbial
translocation, gut inflammation and HIV-1 replication (Aim 2). Dr. Jeremiah Faith, Co-PI, is an internationally
recognized leader in microbiome research, with several seminal contributions to this field. He will characterize
HIV-1-induced alterations of the gut microbiome and their impact on HIV-1-induced mucosal IgA perturbations.
He will also use gnotobiotic mice harboring the gut microbiota from HIV-1-infected patients or healthy controls
to test the impact of cART on intestinal commensal bacteria independently of the host disease status (Aim 3)."

 Diseases of the lung vasculature, including capillary leak syndrome/acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS), inhalation injury, primary pulmonary hypertension, and the novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19),
are difficult to study due to the lack of functional ex vivo models. Conventional culture systems are typically
limited in their ability to represent human pathophysiology for the study of disease and drug mechanisms. The
overall objective of this proposal is to develop an experimental platform that mimics the pulmonary
microvasculature, and that can simulate native cellular phenotypes and functions in vitro, during normal
homeostasis and during disease states such as severe inflammation, and sepsis. The lung microvascular
niche characteristics, such as paracrine factors, hemodynamics, and extracellular matrix composition are all of
pivotal importance for regulating endothelial maturation and maintaining vascular homeostasis. Whole organ
decellularization opens a door to provide a construct that recapitulates the substrate structure and components
of an entire vascular tree. Additionally, leveraging single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq), we developed
computational tools to identify the paracrine signals in human distal lungs. In this study, I will leverage these
tools to identify novel, important locally acting soluble factors in a functional lung microvascular niche to
improve pulmonary microvascular maturation in acellular lung scaffolds. During the K99 phase of this proposal,
I will first leverage our published scRNAseq computational tools to evaluate the scRNAseq dataset on native
adult human lungs. I will determine a group of important and novel soluble factors that could improve
endothelial maturation. Then, I will rationally iterate on our endothelial repopulated lung platform with the
addition of relevant soluble factors derived from the native microvascular milieu. During the R00 phase, I will
use the vascular platform established in prior aims and start to develop a disease modeling system to study the
impact of inflammation for drug testing. This work will lead to the creation of a novel platform which, unlike
previous microvascular platforms, specifically resembles many physiological aspects of the native lung
environment. Such a platform could be used for pulmonary vascular disease modeling and drug testing."

 The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway.
However, there is still a major gap in that much data is still not openly shareable, which we propose to address.
In addition, current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator
sharing the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and
international institutions) as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. substantial computational re-
sources and time is needed to pool data from large studies with local study data). This needs to change, so that
the scientific community can create a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed
while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see overview on this
from our group7). The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed
way while (if required) leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator or the data host; this
motivates a dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. During the previous funding
period, we developed a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit
for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). Our system provides an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool
that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating
data is avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. During this new phase we respond
to the need for advanced algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, by proposing to
develop decentralized models for these approaches and also implement a fully scalable cloud-based framework
with enhanced security features. To achieve this, in Aim 1, we will incorporate the necessary functionality to
scale up analyses via the ability to work with either local or commercial private cloud environments, together with
advanced visualization, quality control, and privacy and security features. This suite of new functions will open
the floodgates for the use of COINSTAC by the larger neuroscience community to enable new discovery and
analysis of unprecedented amounts of brain imaging data located throughout the world. We will also improve
usability, training materials, engage the community in contributing to the open source code base, and ultimately
facilitate the use of COINSTAC's tools for additional science and discovery in a broad range of applications. In
Aim 2 we will extend the framework to handle powerful algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep
learning, and to perform meta-learning for leveraging and updating fit models. And finally, in Aim 3, we will test
this new functionality through a partnership with the worldwide ENIGMA addiction group, which is currently not
able to perform advanced machine learning analyses on data that cannot be centrally located. We will evaluate
the impact of 6 main classes of substances of abuse (e.g. methamphetamines, cocaine, cannabis, nicotine,
opiates, alcohol and their combinations) using the new developed functionality.

 Cancer immunotherapies have achieved unprecedented clinical responses and are revolutionizing cancer
treatments. Despite of the tremendous success of cancer immunotherapies, it remains unclear why only a subset
of individuals responds to treatment and how to turn non-responders to become responsive. Receptor-interacting
protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) regulates cell fate and proinflammatory signaling downstream of multiple innate immune
pathways, including those initiated by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), toll-like receptor ligands, and interferons.
In TNF-α signaling, the kinase activity of RIPK1 is required for inducing apoptosis and necroptosis. RIPK1 also
serves as a kinase-independent scaffolding protein to recruit the NF-κB activation complex, leading to activation
of the NF-κB pathway and cell survival. Interestingly, mice with a kinase-dead Ripk1 mutation (mimicking
inhibitors) and with Ripk1 knockout (mimicking degraders) showed completely different phenotypes. Recently,
our work, along with two other independent studies, showed that knockout of RIPK1 in cancer cells
significantly sensitized tumors to anti-PD1, leading to favorable changes in the tumor microenvironment.
Homozygous loss-of-function RIPK1 mutations are well tolerated in humans. Patients with complete loss of
RIPK1 protein only showed symptoms confined to the immune system with primary immunodeficiency and/or
intestinal inflammation, suggesting that pharmacological RIPK1 degradation can be potentially safe and tolerable,
especially with transient intervention in clinical settings. Leveraging the Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC)
technology, we developed a first-in-class RIPK1 degrader LD4172. In our preliminary study, we showed that
LD4172 potently degrades RIPK1 protein in a panel of human cancer cell lines and inhibits NF-κB activities. The
degradation specificity of LD4172 was confirmed with proteomics profiling. In a mouse melanoma
immunocompetent model, LD4172 significantly synergized with anti-PD1. In this project, we will continue our
medicinal chemistry campaign to develop an orally available RIPK1 degrader and test its efficacy in a panel of
preclinical models with different immune subtypes. Successful completion of this project will lead to the
development of not only a chemical probe to interrogate RIPK1 related biology but also a highly promising
therapeutic agent to advance cancer immunotherapies. We strive to use diverse preclinical models to test the

 Cancer immunotherapies have achieved unprecedented clinical responses and are revolutionizing cancer
treatments. Despite of the tremendous success of cancer immunotherapies, it remains unclear why only a subset
of individuals responds to treatment and how to turn non-responders to become responsive. Receptor-interacting
protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) regulates cell fate and proinflammatory signaling downstream of multiple innate immune
pathways, including those initiated by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), toll-like receptor ligands, and interferons.
In TNF-α signaling, the kinase activity of RIPK1 is required for inducing apoptosis and necroptosis. RIPK1 also
serves as a kinase-independent scaffolding protein to recruit the NF-κB activation complex, leading to activation
of the NF-κB pathway and cell survival. Interestingly, mice with a kinase-dead Ripk1 mutation (mimicking
inhibitors) and with Ripk1 knockout (mimicking degraders) showed completely different phenotypes. Recently,
our work, along with two other independent studies, showed that knockout of RIPK1 in cancer cells
significantly sensitized tumors to anti-PD1, leading to favorable changes in the tumor microenvironment.
Homozygous loss-of-function RIPK1 mutations are well tolerated in humans. Patients with complete loss of
RIPK1 protein only showed symptoms confined to the immune system with primary immunodeficiency and/or
intestinal inflammation, suggesting that pharmacological RIPK1 degradation can be potentially safe and tolerable,
especially with transient intervention in clinical settings. Leveraging the Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC)
technology, we developed a first-in-class RIPK1 degrader LD4172. In our preliminary study, we showed that
LD4172 potently degrades RIPK1 protein in a panel of human cancer cell lines and inhibits NF-κB activities. The
degradation specificity of LD4172 was confirmed with proteomics profiling. In a mouse melanoma
immunocompetent model, LD4172 significantly synergized with anti-PD1. In this project, we will continue our
medicinal chemistry campaign to develop an orally available RIPK1 degrader and test its efficacy in a panel of
preclinical models with different immune subtypes. Successful completion of this project will lead to the
development of not only a chemical probe to interrogate RIPK1 related biology but also a highly promising
therapeutic agent to advance cancer immunotherapies. We strive to use diverse preclinical models to test the
RIPK1 degrader to identify biomarkers, which is very important to identify responsive patients in future clinical

The aim of this inter-disciplinary Pediatric Oncology Research Training (PORT) T32 application is to recruit and
prepare highly qualified, motivated, and diverse physicians for a research-intensive career in Pediatric Oncology.
Multiple reports have emphasized the dire shortage of pediatric oncologists that are well trained in laboratory or
clinical research, those who will advance the field and be the next generation of leaders in enhancing care of
children with cancer. It is increasingly important to retain the best and brightest trainees in research careers. Our
PORT Program is integrated within our NCI-designated Cancer Center Consortium, comprising three academic
partner institutions: the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), Seattle Children’s Hospital (SCH),
and the University of Washington School of Medicine (UWSOM). This provides an unparalleled infrastructure to
build on the 52-year history of our fellowship training program and 43 years of continuous funding of this T32
grant and continue to train the future leaders in pediatric oncology by recruiting the candidates with the highest
academic ceiling and arming them with the most advanced research tools to ensure successful transition to
independent research careers. This training program is available only to MD or MD-PhD-prepared applicants
who have strong interest in a research-intensive career and provides opportunities for training in laboratory-
based science as well as clinical research in outcome/survivorship/health disparity research. It offers support for
2 years of research training for 2 physician/scientists enrolled each year who have completed their first 12 months
of clinical training in our ACGME-approved Pediatric Hematology Oncology Fellowship Program. Most of the
trainee’s time is spent conducting research under the direct supervision of a faculty mentor(s) selected by the
trainee with guidance from a specially selected Research Oversight Committee and the Executive Committee of
the T32. Our program provides didactic teaching and a strong foundation in research design, develops the
trainees’ ability to conceptualize and solve research problems, encourages increasing independence, provides
training in state-of-the-art analytical techniques, requires trainees to present their research findings at scientific
meetings and publish their results, and conveys an understanding of the relationship of the trainee’s research to
health and disease. Our program consists of talented, well-funded and well-published mentors who are deployed
across specific research pathways to expose trainees to diverse scientific questions, methodologies, and disease
models. Longitudinal evaluation of the fellows and the program by Scholar Oversight Committees to ensure
optimal training for the trainee and External Advisory Committee to help review and improve the program is
intrinsic to the training program. Multiple institutional resources to enhance career development are available to
allow all trainees to develop a customized training plan. Researchers trained in this program will be exceptional
physician-scientists who are prepared for a career in a research-intensive setting in pediatric oncology, with
highly developed research skills in cancer biology, diagnosis, prevention, therapy, and outcomes."
10877914,"Autoimmune disease like Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) cause significant
suffering and represent a huge financial burden. Since many individuals are refractory to treatment with the
available drugs, there is a large unmet need to develop new therapeutics for these patients. Although we know
that B cells, antibody (Ab) secreting cells (ASCs), inflammatory cytokines and TLR ligands all play important
roles in driving humoral immune responses to pathogens, vaccines and self-antigens, we still lack a fundamental
understanding of how the signals provided by cytokines and TLR ligands are integrated by responding B cells to
promote the development and expansion of ASCs, which in the case of autoimmunity may produce pathogenic
autoAbs. We characterized an unusual subset of B cells (DN2 cells), which are found in healthy donors (HD)
and expanded in some SLE and RA patients. We showed that DN2 cells, which correlate with disease severity
in SLE, can rapidly differentiate into ASCs, suggesting that these cells are “poised” pre-ASCs. Our data suggest
that early signals provided by IFNg control DN2 development in SLE patients and HD. Moreover, ex vivo
experiments using SLE patient DN2 cells reveal that differentiation of these IFNg-“primed” pre-ASCs requires
additional signals provided by TLR7 ligands and IL-21 and we observed that signals provided by IFNg and IFNa
control TLR7-dependent but not TLR9-dependent differentiation of human B cells. We showed that IFNg but not
IFNa induces expression of the transcription factor IRF1 in human B cells and that IRF1 promotes TLR7-driven
human ASC formation. Therefore, we identified at least 2, and likely 3, independent B cell differentiation
pathways that are differentially reliant on IFNs, IFN-induced transcription factors and TLR ligands. To date, no
studies have focused on how IFNg regulates B cell differentiation and why B cell differentiation in response to
TLR7 and TLR9 are differentially dependent on IFNg. In this proposal, we will test our central hypothesis that
IFNg selectively induces IRF1-dependent reprogramming of B cells, thereby licensing these cells to differentiate
in response to (auto)antigens that engage the TLR7 signaling network. The immediate objectives of this proposal
are to (i) examine the overlapping and distinct roles that IFNg and IFNa play in promoting TLR7-dependent
human ASC development; (ii) determine how IRF1 supports B cell differentiation and (iii) evaluate why TLR7-
mediated B cell differentiation is reliant on IFN-derived signals. Our long-term goal is to use what we learn about
the fundamental mechanisms controlling TLR and cytokine-induced B cell differentiation to identify interventions
that can regulate the formation, maintenance or function of ASCs in health and disease. This research is
significant because we will, for the first time, define the mechanistic basis for IFNg-dependent TLR7-driven
human B cell differentiation. We believe that our studies are important as they will advance our fundamental
understanding of the mechanisms controlling human B cell differentiation and may in the future allow selective
targeting of TLR7-driven autoAb responses without affecting B cell responses to other types of antigens.

Bacterial responses to fatty acids include, but are not limited to, degradation for metabolic gain, modification of
membrane lipids, alteration of protein function and regulation of gene expression. Vibrio species exhibit
significant diversity with regard to the machinery known to participate in the uptake and incorporation of fatty
acids into their membranes. Both aquatic and host niches occupied by Vibrio are rife with various free fatty acids
and fatty acid-containing lipids. The roles of fatty acids in the survival and pathogenesis of bacteria have begun
to emerge and are expected to expand significantly. Compared to the import mechanisms of minerals (e.g., iron)
and sugars (e.g., lactose), the process and significance of scavenging and handling fatty acids is punctuated
with gaps in knowledge.
 Gaining a better understanding of how microbes harness environment-specific resources will shed light
on several themes of pathogenesis, such as environmental persistence, transmission to humans, and course of
disease. The varied abilities of bacteria to recognize, uptake and utilize lipid molecules from their environment
certainly represents a worthwhile research endeavor. It is hypothesized that Vibrio cholerae undergoes
significant structural modifications to its membrane phospholipids depending on the exogenously available
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and that these alterations affect membrane permeability sufficient to
change the susceptibility to membrane active antimicrobials. The proposed project seeks to advance a specific
mission of the NIGMS: to increase our understanding of biological processes and lay the foundation for advances
in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Accordingly, the research aims are to i) interrogate the nature
and degree of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) incorporation into membrane phospholipids and ii) examine the
altered membrane dynamics and antibiotic susceptibility conferred by exogenously acquired PUFAs.
Bioanalytical methodologies (thin-layer chromatography and UPLC/MS) will quantify and structurally
characterize exogenous PUFA-mediated phospholipid modifications. Interrogation of membrane permeability
will be performed in vitro using established dye-based assays and in silico with atomistic modeling and simulation
analyses. Collectively, the data will lay the foundation for deciphering a versatile pathway in Gram-negative
bacteria by defining PUFA assimilation capability and its impact on membrane permeability, a critical cellular
attribute that must be characterized in the interest of developing strategies to combat infection.
 The results of these studies should contribute to our current understanding of how and why bacteria have
evolved to utilize a variety of exogenous lipid molecules, thus providing insight into their survival both outside
and within the host, as well as unlocking pathways vulnerable to antimicrobial attack."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia affecting more than six million people in the United
States. The complex genetic risk and the lack of disease-specific biomarkers for AD are among the most
challenges that investigators and clinicians face in early prediction, diagnosis, prevention, and intervention.
There is an urgent need for early identification of individuals with higher risk before the onset of symptoms. With
the rapid accumulation of genetic data, researchers have developed high-performance genetic models to predict
complex diseases including AD. For example, polygenic risk score (PRS), designed to estimate individual genetic
liability by integrating large GWAS summary statistics and individual genotype data, has provided a potential
value to predict diseases like AD. Recent artificial intelligence (AI) coupled with promising machine learning (ML)
techniques have been shown to yield meaningful insights when applied to “Big Data”. Convolutional neural
network (CNN), a machine learning algorithm widely used in image and object classification, has shown
informative results in the medical field aiding image data analyses. However, the application of CNN to non-
image data such as genetic data is limited. Lately, our group has developed an artificial image objects (AIOs)
method to transform tabular data into images. Uniquely, our AIO technique not only allows us to adapt CNN
algorithms to classify disease but also identify biomarkers associated with the disease. Our preliminary study is
encouraging: 1). CNN with single nucleotide variant (SNV)-transformed AIOs improves disease classification in
schizophrenia; 2). CNN with RNA-seq data-transformed AIOs facilitates biomarker discovery in breast cancer;
3). CNN with PRSs-transformed AIOs from multiple genetically correlated traits performs better in AD prediction,
as compared with the conventional logistic regression model with PRSs from AD alone. We hypothesize that
CNN models with PRSs from multiple genetically correlated traits can improve AD classification and identify the
biomarkers for early prediction and therapeutic targets. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims:
1: To build and validate the prediction model for AD classification using CNN algorithms and mtPRS-
transformed AIOs. 2: To identify and validate biomarkers specific to AD by integrating multi-omics data
and CNN algorithms. The approach is innovative in that we are the first to transform PRS and SNV genetic
data into AIOs and apply AI/CNN for AD classification and biomarker identification. We are also the first to
integrate PRS from multiple comorbid traits for AD prediction. The application is significant because we will
promote AD prevention with a high-performance prediction model that can identify high-risk individuals at an
earlier stage and identify disease-specific biomarkers for drug discovery. The overall objectives of this R15 AREA
grant are to 1) Develop a CNN model to identify individuals with higher risk for AD; 2) Identify biomarkers for
future drug development; 3) Accelerate research activities at UNLV through collaboration with faculty members
and students that will enhance career development for the students and investigators."
10880551,"ALS, FTD, and Alzheimer’s are complex diseases that each result from many diverse genetic etiologies.
Although therapeutic strategies that target specific causal mutations (e.g. SOD1 ASOs) may prove effective
against individual forms of ALS and FTD, these approaches cannot address the vast majority of cases that
have unknown genetic etiology. Moreover, given the large number of different genes that likely contribute to
ALS and FTD and the fact that each genetic form is relatively rare, this strategy may be difficult to implement
for all cases. Thus, there is a pressing need for new therapeutic strategies that rescue multiple forms of
ALS and FTD, particularly those with unknown genetic etiologies. To identify new therapeutic targets that
rescue multiple forms of ALS, we performed unbiased chemical screens to search for targets that can rescue
the degeneration of iPSC motor neurons from multiple C9ORF72 and sporadic ALS patients. Inhibitors of
PIKFYVE kinase were among the most potent and broadly-efficacious compounds across patient lines.
Surprisingly, the data show that PIKFYVE inhibition rescues neurodegeneration by blocking autophagosome-
lysosome fusion, which induces secretory autophagy to clear misfolded proteins including C9ORF72 dipeptide
repeat proteins and TDP-43 through exosomal secretion. The accumulation of misfolded proteins can induce
neuron death and is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases. Although studies have sought to
stimulate known proteostasis pathways including the proteosome and autophagy, these pathways decline
during aging and may be difficult to rescue effectively. Intriguingly, recent studies have shown that neurons use
exosomal secretion as a third proteostasis pathway. However, it remains unknown if this pathway can be
harnessed to treat ALS and related neurodegenerative diseases. The central hypothesis of the proposed study
that secretory autophagy is one of the most potent ways to prevent neurodegeneration in ALS, FTD, and
Alzheimer’s disease differs from mainstream thinking in the field. Evaluating this hypothesis is crucial because
activating the proteasome and autophagy has had mixed results in neurodegeneration models. The proposed
study will 1) confirm that secretory autophagy is the therapeutic mechanism of PIKFYVE inhibition, 2)
determine the efficacy of secretory autophagy in ALS, FTD, and Alzheimer’s disease patient-derived
neurons, and 3) validate the efficacy of PIKFYVE suppression with antisense oligonucleotides in vivo.
This application seeks to shift current research by validating the induction of secretory autophagy as a
highly effective therapeutic strategy for diverse forms of ALS, FTD, and Alzheimer’s disease. The
proposed study will establish PIKFYVE suppression and secretory autophagy as critical therapeutic
targets for ALS and related neurodegenerative diseases. More broadly, this therapeutic strategy may
be effective for other diseases driven by aberrant protein accumulation."

10880679,"Project Summary
Immunotherapy, and in particular immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), has emerged as one of the most promising
tools in the fight against breast cancer, with the advantages of treating both local and disseminated disease, and
protecting against cancer recurrence. However, response rates to ICB have been limited clinically: only ~16% of
breast cancer patients respond to ICB. ICB exerts its effects by preventing the suppression of effector anti-cancer
T cells in order to maintain a strong anti-cancer immune response. Because the adaptive immune system is
housed within lymphoid organs, and tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) have been shown to contain higher
concentrations of tumor-disseminated antigen, we hypothesize a role for TDLNs in facilitating cognate T cell-
antigen interactions that lead to activation of anti-cancer T cells that are prerequisite for ICB response. I
hypothesize that tumor-mediated alterations in fluid dynamics and local microenvironments alter antigen-cognate
T cell interactions, which impairs ICB responses clinically. In the proposed study, I will test this hypothesis using
animal models which allow for longitudinal surveillance of lymph flow and the assessment of T cells and antigen-
presenting cells within lymph nodes. I will cancer models that spontaneously develop lymph node metastases in
a robust manner and use immunomodulatory interventions to test interrogate the role of lymph nodes in
generating anti-cancer immunity. Further, we will determine the effects of primary in situ tumors, and the
presence of intra-lymph node metastases on the T cell interactions with cognate antigen in lymph nodes and the
impacts of these parameters on ICB efficacy. Finally, the impacts of removal of the primary tumor—a large
source of cancer antigen for development of anti-cancer responses—on T cell phenotypes and resulting ICB
responses will be measured. As a whole, this work has the potential to both inform clinical standard of care, and
to improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade.
 I have extensive training in the use of animal models to investigate the tumor immunology, and in
understanding how antigen is transported from tumors to lymph nodes to impact anti-tumor immune responses.
This project will leverage my training and allow me to grow new expertise in the labs of my postdoctoral
advisors—Dr. Padera and Dr. Munn—who are leaders in lymphatic and vascular biology as well as tumor
microenvironment research. Dr. Padera’s lab has developed state-of-the-art lymphatic imaging tools to precisely
measure lymph flow rate, and dynamic intravital microscopy of tumor dissemination through lymphatic
vasculature and within lymph nodes. Dr. Munn’s lab has developed bioengineered models of angiogenesis and
tumor biology, and sophisticated computational models of lymph nodes and lymphatic transport. Their combined
guidance will allow me to successfully complete the aims of this proposal. Furthermore, the unique environment
within the Steele Laboratories at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School will provide the
training I need to take the next step toward an independent research career."
10880680,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Overexpression of the oncogene MYC is characteristic of most high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, and is
essential for the survival of lymphoma models. However, only half of DLBCLs assigned to high-risk subgroups
of germinal center-like (GCB)-DLBCL by gene expression profiling bear activating genomic rearrangements of
MYC, and MYC rearrangements are even less frequent in another common high-risk subtype, ABC-DLBCL.
There is currently a poor understanding of the mechanisms that lead to MYC transcriptional dysregulation in
DLBCL in the absence of an activating genomic rearrangement between MYC and an immunoglobulin gene
locus (MYC-IG). The overall objective of this proposal is to define novel mechanisms of MYC regulation by distal
enhancers. Our long-term goal is to use this understanding to develop improved therapeutic strategies and / or
predictive biomarkers for DLBCL patients. Our working hypothesis is that transcriptional activation of MYC
required to sustain DLBCL is dependent on the cis-regulatory activity of a small number of essential distal
enhancer modules, located within much larger “super-enhancer” regions. These modules are located either
within the 3’ region of the MYC locus on 8q24 (in DLBCL without MYC rearrangement), or in a genomic
rearrangement partner locus such as 3q27, which is among the most common non-IG MYC rearrangement
partners. We will utilize high-throughput CRISPR-interference profiling to perform robust functional interrogation
of complex, multi-modular “super-enhancers” present in 8q24 and 3q27 in DLBCL cell lines that lack MYC
rearrangements (Aim 1), or bear t(3;8)(q27;q24) rearrangements (Aim 2) respectively. Having identified the
discrete distal enhancer elements that are required for MYC activation, we will utilize a complementary set of
experimental approaches, including genetic deletion or mutation of enhancer sequences, chromatin
immunoprecipitation, reporter assays, in vitro DNA-protein binding assays, and perturbation of trans factors and
upstream pathways to characterize the regulation of these elements. Our preliminary data suggests that distinct
enhancer modules within the 3’ MYC enhancer region are essential for DLBCLs with different aberrations
affecting trans factors that selectively bind the essential enhancer modules. These aberrations include diverse
signaling and genetic events that activate NF-kB factors, or alternately, hyperactivation of the coactivator OCA-
B and a set of synergistically acting developmental transcription factors. We will evaluate the extent to which
MYC activation in the context of a t(3;8) rearrangement is dependent on “hijacking” of MEF2B-regulated
enhancer modules that are typically responsible for activation of the oncogene BCL6. Upon successful
completion of the proposed research, we expect to rigorously define multiple distinct mechanisms by which
enhancers and associated trans-factors can drive MYC transcriptional activation in DLBCL. Our innovative
approach for identifying the key mechanisms underlying oncogene activation by complex multi-modular distal
enhancers may serve as a model for similar investigations in a wide variety of cancer types."

To understand the function and dynamics of neural circuits that control behaviors and cognitions, we need to observe the neuronal network at a cellular resolution over large spatial scales across multiple brain regions. Although two-photon fluorescence microscopy (TPM) combined with genetically encoded function indicators has provided a paradigm shift in neuroscience by enabling cellular resolution functional imaging deep in brain tissue, current TPM technologies still fall short of achieving whole-neocortex coverage. In this project, the engineering team at Purdue and the neuroscience team at UCSD will join the force to develop the Light Pipe Microscope (LPM) and enable ultra-large-scale whole-neocortex calcium imaging.  Compared to conventional TPMs, LPM offers three advantages. First, LPM offers unparalleled signal collection capabilities over a large imaging field of view, which translates to superior imaging quality, depth, and extremely low photobleaching for long-duration continuous recording. Second, LPM features an extremely compact body, which allows multiple LPMs to be densely or sparsely packed to simultaneously image the curved brain surface. Third, LPM can be constructed with low-cost components and is fully compatible with common lasers, scanners, data acquisition systems, and software, which will facilitate broad dissemination. In particular, the single LPM and the dual LPMs can be constructed as add-on components to the existing two-photon imaging systems with a small fraction of the cost of a commercial TPM. They will convert the existing two-photon systems for ultra-large-scale cellular resolution functional imaging of mammalian brains.  Through the proposed development, we will have the fully developed and thoroughly validated LPM, each with a large FOV and unparalleled signal collection efficiency. A low-cost ($4,800) single unit (as an add-on) can convert the widely used two-photon scopes into mesoscopes with unmatched signal levels. The utilization of two or more LPMs will provide unprecedented ultra-large-scale two-photon imaging coverage, which will transform the study and understanding of mammalian brains."

Metastatic bone disease afflicts the majority of patients with advanced carcinomas and is the most common oncologic
disease of the skeleton. The proximal femur is the most frequently affected location in the appendicular skeleton and is a
source of significant morbidity affecting patient mobility and quality of life. Stabilization of metastatic bone disease of the
proximal femur has historically been achieved with internal fixation. This approach is meant to provide enough stability
to ambulate without pain for the remainder of the patient’s life. However, with advances in systemic treatment options,
many patients with metastatic carcinomas are experiencing significantly longer life spans. Therefore, internal fixation is
increasingly resulting in devastating surgical failures and the need for revision surgery in up 20% of patients in the first
year after surgery. Alternatively, complete resection of the affected bone followed by endoprosthetic reconstruction,
although more invasive and conferring higher surgical risks than an internal fixation procedure, reduces the risk for implant
failure to approximately 3%, and avoids the deleterious effects on function and quality of life caused by implant failure.
However, at this time, the evidence supporting the use of resection and endoprosthetic reconstruction for metastatic
bone disease of the proximal femur, although promising, is retrospective and methodologically weak, resulting in a gap in
the necessary evidence to make this significant practice change. To address this need, we propose the Proximal FEmur
Resection or Internal Fixation fOR Metastases (PERFORM) trial, which will aim to determine if resection and
endoprosthetic reconstruction improves orthopaedic patient outcomes compared to internal fixation in patients with
metastatic bone disease of the proximal femur. Our proposed trial planning period of two years is critical for the successful
design and implementation of this potentially practice changing trial. During this planning phase, we will achieve the
following three specific aims: 1) finalize the trial protocol; 2) establish the trial-specific infrastructure; and 3) determine
feasibility at each clinical site and prepare relevant clinical sites for trial initiation."

Pyroptosis is a Programmed Trial-by-Fire.
PROJECT ABSTRACT
The inflammatory cell death program pyroptosis occurs in a wide range of cell types and plays important roles
in development, tissue injury, and tumor growth. Curiously, unlike other cell death mechanisms, cells frequently
survive pyroptosis activation. The persistence of a family of “inefficient” cell death genes is puzzling and suggests
they may have other roles. Intuitively, cells that survive the inflammatory insult will dictate both the short-term
adaptation and long-term repair and regeneration afterwards. Therefore, a flawed death program may actually
be a “trial”. However, the details of cell survival after pyroptosis and the biochemical circuitry beyond its activation
are under-studied, hindering our basic understanding. In this Program, we hypothesize that cell death is a side-
effect of pyroptosis, which in fact aims to reprogram cell functions. To explore the new concept that “trial-by-fire”
provides strong evolutionary advantages, we will investigate 1) whether it is possible to stop/resume pyroptosis
and the basic mechanisms used to exert such control; 2) the capacity and limits of pyroptosis signaling; and 3)
the single cell phenotypic effects of weathering pyroptosis. In pursuing this central hypothesis, we will discover
new cell signaling circuits and simultaneously enhance the field’s ability to detect novel pathways by developing
new genetically encoded tools, imaging algorithms, and bioinformatics methods. The Program aims to construct
a new perspective that the salient function of pyroptosis is to prime and educate through a near-death experience."
10894244,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Candidate: Kara R. Mizokami-Stout, MD, MSc is an adult endocrinologist and early career investigator focused
on personalized diabetes management to improve health outcomes. Dr. Mizokami-Stout’s long-term career
objective is to become an independent physician-investigator who promotes evidence-based, system-level
changes to prevent diabetic complications and improve diabetes-specific quality-of-life.
Research Context: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) improves glycemic control, reduces hypoglycemia
and facilitates personalized care in insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes (T2D). Despite these benefits, only 3% of
eligible T2D patients seen in primary care are utilizing CGM devices and nearly one-third of CGM-users stop
using these devices after six months. A comprehensive evaluation and a coordinated strategy to target key
determinants of CGM adoption and retention is lacking for T2D, particularly in primary care settings where over
90% of patients with T2D receive their diabetes care. Interventions that address determinants at multiple levels
of influence (e.g., patient, provider, health system) are required to achieve such coordinated delivery and improve
effectiveness of CGM in insulin-requiring T2D.
Research Aims: Dr. Mizokami-Stout will utilize Implementation Science (via the Tailored Implementation in
Chronic Diseases checklist) to: (1) develop an in-depth understanding of patient-, provider-, and system-level
barriers and facilitators to CGM use; (2) design an evidence- and theory-based multilevel intervention entitled
Support to Adopt and Retain Technology (StART) CGM that addresses key determinants of CGM adoption and
retention; and (3) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of StART CGM to improve CGM
adoption and retention in insulin-requiring T2D in primary care.
Career Development Plan: Dr. Mizokami-Stout will develop expertise in: (1) Implementation Science for
intervention development and evaluation; (2) designing multilevel, tailored interventions utilizing the electronic
health record; and 3) mixed methods evaluation of pragmatic trials. Dr. Mizokami-Stout’s training will be
supported by highly experienced, interdisciplinary mentors; advanced didactic coursework; and participation in
research and career development meetings and seminars within an ideal training environment. An NIDDK K-23
award will allow Dr. Mizokami-Stout to become an independent physician-investigator and national leader in
developing, testing and implementing multilevel interventions to incorporate evidence-based diabetes
technology into routine diabetes care."
10894250,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Post-transcriptional mechanisms play a fundamental role in regulating gene expression at the protein level,
and are frequently implicated in stress response, aging, and diseases. The goal of this project is to develop
and apply multi-omics methods to examine the post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate protein
composition of multiple tissues and their ability to respond to proteostatic stressors. In recent work, our team
has developed mass spectrometry and multi-omics methods that are designed to elucidate the protein isoform
composition and spatiotemporal dynamics. Building on these progresses, we will focus here on the roles of
three post-transcriptional mechanisms known to influence protein translation in stress response.
 Specifically, Aim 1 will integrate proteomics and transcriptomics data to identify the role of alternative
splicing in modulating principal isoform abundance, creating alternative proteoforms, and influencing protein
localization in mammalian tissues. Aim 2 will determine the differential expression, localization, and targets
of RNA-binding proteins in proteostatic stress responses including paraquat in vivo as well as doxorubicin
and hydrogen peroxide in vitro. Finally, Aim 3 will examine the configuration and interactome of the translation
apparatus including the core ribosome and an increasing number of known ribosome-associated proteins,
which have emerged as important factors that can fine-tune the translational efficiency of individual transcripts
and the associated protein synthesis rates.
 The proposed experiments will interrogate the relationships between post-transcriptional regulation
and stress response, and at the same time generate novel data sets including isoform-resolved,
spatiotemporal atlases of the normal, stressed, and aged/senescent proteomes. We anticipate the results will
lead to novel insights into basic cellular processes of stress response and resilience that will be relevant to
studies of multiple systems."
10913633,"Project Summary
The rapid response of the innate immune system to infections relies on the detection of pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharides, that activate a robust inflammatory response to
invading organisms. My research program focuses on an unappreciated countermeasure deployed by
commensal bacteria and pathogens that attenuates the immune response to PAMPs. Oleate hydratase (OhyA)
is an enzyme that is expressed in commensal bacteria and the important human pathogen Staphylococcus
aureus. OhyA stereospecifically hydrates the 9-cis double bond of unsaturated fatty acids to produce 10-
hydroxy-fatty acids (hFAs); however, bacteria expressing OhyA do not synthesize unsaturated fatty acids.
OhyA substrates are only encountered at the interface of host tissues, where unsaturated fatty acids are
abundant. I hypothesize that hFAs produced by commensal or pathogenic organisms serve as signaling
molecules that blunt the innate immune response to PAMPs. Indeed, S. aureus ohyA knockouts fail to
establish infections in mice, illustrating the importance of OhyA and hFAs to S. aureus virulence. Thus, hFAs,
which were first discovered in the gut microbiome, may provide an important mechanism for commensal
bacteria to attenuate gastrointestinal inflammation and create tolerant, symbiotic environments. My pilot
experiments and some previous reports provide preliminary evidence for the anti-inflammatory action of hFAs,
but the mechanism(s) of immune suppression by hFAs are unknown. To address this shortcoming, I will
receive formal immunology instruction through coursework and hands-on training in the laboratory of Dr. Paul
Thomas, an expert immunologist, during the K99 phase. We will determine whether hFAs directly antagonize
extracellular PAMP binding to immune cell receptors, bind to CD1 lipid-presenting molecules for T-cell receptor
recognition to antagonize T cell activation, or intercept signaling downstream of PAMP-receptor activation by
stimulating G-protein coupled receptors and/or PAPR. The results of these experiments will uncover the
mechanistic basis for hFA modification of immune cell responses. OhyA has no mammalian homolog, and
validating the importance of OhyA for virulence coupled with the X-ray structures of OhyA will provide the key
information required to determine whether OhyA is a candidate target for antimicrobial drug discovery. During
the R00 phase, I will test the hypothesis that OhyA is packaged into extracellular vesicles released by S.
aureus to interact with surrounding host tissues to form a halo of hFA mediators around the infection site. My
findings will provide an atomistic mechanistic understanding of how OhyA binds to and influences membrane
structure to promote vesicle formation. The K99/R00 research plan is designed to leverage my expertise in
biochemistry and structural biology, while receiving new training in immunology, to advance the understanding
of immune regulation by bacteria and launch a productive and successful career in which I will lead a research
program to elucidate the role bacteria lipid products play in controlling host responses."

 Activation of immune cells plays a critical role in initiation and progression of multiple sclerosis (MS), leading
to progressive neurodegeneration of the central nervous system (CNS). While glutamate imbalance has been
described in MS brains and has been proposed to contribute to axonal damage and tissue destruction, the
relationships between glutamate dynamics and immune activation during disease progression remain unclear.
Presently, the lack of clinically available noninvasive imaging methods to detect immune cells and glutamate
metabolism limits our understanding of MS pathogenesis and monitoring of responses to therapies.
 Recent development of radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PET) have shown great potential for
detection of cells from the immune system and for imaging glutamate reuptake by astroglial excitatory amino
acid transporter-2 (EAAT2). Specifically, 2'-deoxy-2'-[18F]fluoro-9-β-D-arabinofuranosylguanine ([18F]F-AraG)
enables the detection of activated T-cells in inflammatory diseases and cancer models. [18F]Fluoro-
fluorenylaspartyl amide ([18F]FFAA) has demonstrated the ability to measure EAAT2 activity in the CNS.
Hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (HP 13C MRSI) is an emerging imaging technique
which measures enzymatic reactions in vivo in real-time. HP 13C pyruvate has been shown to detect highly
glycolytic cells from the innate immune system in peripheral and CNS inflammation models. Recently, pyruvate
labelled on the second carbon position, [2-13C]pyruvate, provided a new way to monitor glutamate production in
the human brain.
 This project proposes to validate these innovative noninvasive PET and MR methods to provide a new way
to investigate the relationships between innate and adaptive immune responses and glutamate dynamics in
preclinical MS models. The mentored phase of this project will develop and validate new neuroimaging
technologies: Aim 1 will investigate the potential of [18F]F-AraG and [18F]FFAA PET imaging to visualize activated
T-cells and glutamate reuptake during disease progression. Aim 2 will develop and validate HP [2-13C]pyruvate
as a method to simultaneously detect pro-inflammatory innate immune cells and determine real-time brain
glutamate production. The independent phase of this project will build on these initial results and Aim 3 will
evaluate the potential of this multimodal PET and MRI approach to monitor immune responses, glutamate
production, and astrocyte functions following therapy. Central to the success of this proposal, Dr. Guglielmetti
will have the support and guidance from an established group of experts in neuroimaging, particularly HP 13C
MR technology (Dr. Myriam Chaumeil and Dr. Peder Larson) and PET imaging (Dr. Henry VanBrocklin) as well
as in neuroimmunology and MS (Dr. Ari Green and Dr. Zamvil), providing her with the necessary skillsets to
embark on a career as an independent scientist."
10894327,"Project Summary/Abstract
Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are more likely to develop neurodevelopmental deficits than the
general population. Due to advances in interventional surgical techniques, survival rates for patients with CHD
are high, but they face adverse neurodevelopmental challenges – such as cognitive deficits – and attain lower
education and social interaction, leading to reduced quality of life. Despite a multitude of studies examining risk
factors for adverse neurodevelopment outcomes in children with CHD, only a small proportion of observed
variations in cognitive tests can be attributed to these tested exposures. A larger portion of risk factors that may
play critical roles in adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with CHD remains to be discovered. One
such risk factor is likely to be alterations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) characteristics manifested as alterations in
volume and flow dynamics. Recent studies show that normal CSF circulation is necessary for healthy neuronal
growth and maintenance of a homeostatic environment for normal neuronal function. Abnormalities in the CSF
have been linked to neurological diseases such as autism spectrum disorder in children and dementia in adults.
In CHD, abnormal CSF findings, especially increased CSF volume, are frequently observed. Increased CSF
volume has been shown to be correlated with brain dysmaturation and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes in
young children with CHD. Although in the elderly, there are studies that link decreased CSF flow velocities with
cognitive impairment. Currently, CSF flow alterations in children with CHD have yet to be examined in vivo, and
the possible link between CSF flow and increased volume to cognitive outcomes remains to be explored. This
project aims to examine the relationship between disruption in CSF characteristics and neurodevelopmental
deficits in children with CHD. We hypothesize that aberrant CSF characteristics (increased volumes and
decreased flow velocity) measured using MRI will be powerful multi-modal imaging predictors for
neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with CHD. This project leverages a Department of Defense-funded
ongoing study at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh involving children with CHD and age-matched healthy
controls who receive MRI imaging as well as neuropsychologic testing – including executive function. In this
project, we propose measuring intracranial CSF volume (extra-axial and intra-ventricular volume) using structural
MRI (T1 and T2 images) and measuring CSF flow velocity through the Aqueduct Silvius using phase-contrast
MRI. These CSF measurements will then be correlated with neuropsychological tests assessing executive
function. The results from this proposed project will help determine (1) differences in CSF characteristics
between children with CHD and healthy controls and (2) any correlation between CSF characteristics and
neurodevelopmental outcomes in CHD. Taken together, we hope to develop useful CSF-based imaging
biomarkers to prognosticate poor neurodevelopmental outcomes in pediatric patients with CHD."

More than 25% of people with HIV (PWH) globally report unhealthy alcohol use, defined as a spectrum of use
from risky/hazardous (drinking more than the recommended daily, weekly or per-occasion amounts resulting in
increased risk for health consequences) to alcohol use disorder. PWH with unhealthy alcohol use may not
adhere to their antiretroviral therapy (ART), leading to unsuppressed virus and increasing the potential for HIV
transmission to sexual and injection partners. Interventions that address alcohol use among PWH are needed
to prevent HIV transmission. We previously showed that the brief alcohol intervention (BAI) is effective at
reducing alcohol use and increasing viral suppression in Vietnam. The BAI is ready for scale-up but one barrier
to scale-up is attitudes towards alcohol interventions among clinical staff, especially in regions with normative
unhealthy alcohol use. Addressing clinical staff attitudes may be essential for scale-up. We propose a hybrid
type 3, cluster randomized implementation trial to examine effective strategies to scale up the BAI in ART
clinics in Vietnam. One arm will receive only facilitation for BAI implementation. Facilitation is a flexible strategy
that helps clinics to address common barriers, such as counselor skills, competing priorities, and resource
deficits. In the other arm, in addition to facilitation, clinic staff, irrespective of their own alcohol use, will be
offered the BAI themselves as experiential learning to address their own alcohol-related attitudes and
behaviors. We hypothesize that EBAI, added to facilitation, will increase BAI fidelity, acceptability, and
penetration at the clinic level, and improve viral suppression among PWH with unhealthy alcohol use. Our
specific aims are to: 1) Compare BAI implementation using facilitation (FAC) only to experiential BAI plus
facilitation (EBAI+FAC) in ART clinics in Vietnam; 2) Explore the mechanisms of successful BAI scale up in
both the FAC and EBAI+FAC arms; and 3) Measure the impact of EBAI on clinic staff. ART clinics (n=30)
across Vietnam will be randomized to receive FAC or EBAI+FAC. PWH in the clinics will be screened for
unhealthy alcohol use with the AUDIT-C; if positive, they will be offered the BAI. The primary implementation
outcomes are clinic-level BAI fidelity (primary), with secondary outcomes of acceptability, penetration, and
cost. The effectiveness outcomes are viral suppression (primary) and alcohol use (secondary), measured
among a cohort of PWH recruited in each clinic. Outcomes will be measured at 3 months (implementation
outcomes only) and 12 months (all outcomes). In parallel with the trial, we will use mixed methods to examine
the organizational and clinic staff characteristics that underly successful BAI scale-up. Given the importance of
the clinic staff in the BAI implementation, we will also explore the impact of the BAI on their own alcohol-related
attitudes and use and considering whether they received the BAI themselves or not. This trial will present
critical information for worldwide HIV treatment as prevention efforts, providing strategies for effective scale-up
of the BAI among PWH with unhealthy alcohol use."

Despite extensive efforts aimed toward the development of improved molecular therapies targeting acute
myeloid leukemia (AML), clinical outcomes remain poor. Of particular interest, is the necessary and selective
therapeutic targeting of disease initiating leukemia stem cells (LSC). The Jordan laboratory has reported that
LSC are functionally reliant upon BCL2 for cellular oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) requirements. Targeting
BCL2 with venetoclax (Ven) in combination with azacitidine (Aza) has clinically delivered significant responses
in newly diagnosed AML patients, however both upfront refractory and relapsed diseases are still a major
obstacle. Notably, we show that Ven/Aza resistant AML express elevated MCL1 protein and OXPHOS levels.
Moreover, the Jordan laboratory have recently reported that pharmacologic perturbation of MCL1 in resistant
specimens leads to a selective decrease in OXPHOS output as well as reduced LSC functional ability as
measured by engraftment of immune deficient mice. Continued analysis of Ven/Aza resistant AML highlighted a
significant increase in mitochondrial fission promoting DRP1 phosphorylation as well as in metabolomic
enrichment of fatty acid oxidation. Thus, we hypothesize that MCL1 specifically drives Ven/Aza resistance by
promoting mitochondrial fission and β-oxidation. As this proposal aims to define the mechanisms through which
MCL1 uniquely influences therapy resistance in AML, our studies will largely utilize Ven/Aza resistant primary
AML specimens to interrogate the specific role of MCL1 in regulating mitochondrial function through fission and
β-oxidation. Successful completion of these studies will generate a detailed and mechanistic understanding of
the non-canonical roles for MCL1 in regulating mitochondrial morphology and lipid metabolism, while also
providing alternative approaches for therapeutic intervention in therapy resistant AML."
10888164,"Project Summary/Abstract
Targeted therapies for aging-related mobility disability are urgently needed to preserve quality of life and pre-
vent morbidity/mortality in the rapidly expanding aging population. Progressive decline in mobility with aging
has been partially attributed to loss of skeletal muscle (SM) mass and function, as well as an increase in the
quantity of adipose tissue (AT). The quality of AT and AT-secreted factors are also likely to influence this pro-
cess, yet meager evidence exists for this notion. Cellular senescence, a phenomenon by which normal healthy
cells cease to divide and therefore become programmed for cellular death, occurs in adipose tissue and is as-
sociated with poorer mobility. Furthermore, secreted factors from AT, potentially from senescent or dying cells,
induces insulin resistance and atrophy in human skeletal muscle cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate
that AT quality (i.e., structure and function) can directly impact skeletal muscle function. This adipose-skeletal
muscle crosstalk has been increasingly implicated in poor functional and metabolic outcomes in younger hu-
man populations. The unique contributions of AT structure and function and AT-secreted factors to mobility de-
cline and skeletal muscle function in the context of human aging have not been addressed. The proposed stud-
ies will fill a critical knowledge gap by directly assessing structural and functional components of AT in aging
and using their associations with mobility to identify AT-secreted proteins that negatively impact skeletal mus-
cle function. The long-term goal of this ancillary study is to leverage and add to the outstanding resources of
the parent SOMMA project to understand the contribution of AT quality, AT-secreted factors and AT-skeletal
muscle crosstalk to mobility disability and other complications of aging in humans. Our overall objective is to
identify key structural and functional components of AT quality - including necrosis, senescence, inflammation,
self-renewal and metabolic flexibility - and AT-secreted proteins that influence mobility via direct effects on
skeletal muscle. We hypothesize that AT structure and function influences AT-secreted proteins that contribute
to aging-related mobility outcomes by directly impacting skeletal muscle function. The stated purpose of Aim 1
is to determine which structural and functional components of AT are associated with slower walking speed.
We posit that increased cellular senescence, increased necrosis, increased inflammation, decreased capacity
for self-renewal and metabolic inflexibility will be associated with slower walking speed. For Aim 2, we antici-
pate that incubation of human muscle cells with known and novel secreted proteins - identified through stand-
ard immunoassay panels and unbiased proteomics and shown to be associated with aberrations in AT struc-
ture and/or function - will worsen mitochondrial respiration, increase oxidative stress, decrease contractility and
muscle cell diameter. This work will have a positive translational impact by improving strategies for prevention
and/or treatment of aging-related mobility disability and by promoting knowledge and facilitating future studies
to understanding AT-skeletal muscle crosstalk across the lifespan."
10888291,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The induction of protective immune responses through vaccination is central to the management of many
pathogens. For antigenically variable pathogens such as influenza, protective immune responses impose a major
selective pressure on viral populations and indirectly influence vaccine strain selection and vaccine
effectiveness. Our poor understanding of the generation and maintenance of protective immunity to influenza
hinders vaccine development and the accuracy of evolutionary forecasts. Antibody titers to the hemagglutinin
(HA) surface protein were established as a correlate of protection 50 years ago, and more recent evidence shows
many anti-HA antibodies directly and indirectly contribute to viral neutralization. However, HA titers remain only
moderately predictive of an individual’s risk of infection on exposure, and the contributions of other immune
responses are less well understood. Understanding the causes in addition to correlates of protection could
increase the accuracy of forecasts of viral fitness and provide reliable endpoints for vaccine development. Here,
we propose complementary approaches to identify the correlates and drivers underlying protection from infection
and heterogeneity in vaccine responses. We will integrate diverse variables, including infection and vaccination
history, baseline antigen-specific and antigen-agnostic immune states, intrinsic characteristics including age,
sex, and body mass to predict responses to influenza vaccination and extract mechanistic insight. In order to
address our specific aims, we will leverage data from existing, longitudinal studies of immune parameters
following influenza virus infections and vaccination in humans. First we will use computational and multimodal
single-cell approaches to investigate how vaccination and infection impact host immune status. Emerging
evidence, including our own data, suggests that vaccination and infection can establish new antigen-agnostic
immune set points that affect future vaccine responses. Next we propose to integrate complementary
computational approaches, spanning machine learning, causal mediation analysis, and mechanistic modeling to
predict and develop causal mechanistic insight into vaccine responsiveness and protection from severe and mild
infection. We will develop and distribute a suite of accompanying tools to make these novel approaches
accessible to bench and computational biologists. Improved prediction of immune responses, especially
protective immune responses, could lead to more effective vaccination strategies that mitigate vaccine failure in
different subpopulations and improve the public health impact of influenza vaccination. The methods and tools
that we develop can provide foundational frameworks to dissect responses to other vaccines and pathogens."

10889151,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Aging of thymus precedes the aging of other organs. Notably, the new T cell specificities can only be
generated in a functional thymus and peripheral proliferation of pre-existing T cell clones provides limited
immune-vigilance in the elderly. Therefore, loss of thymic function contributes to restriction of T cell repertoire.
Consistent with this, age-related thymic involution is a cardinal feature of immune-senescence that leads to
increased risk and severity of emerging infections (including COVID-19), certain cancers, vaccination failures,
and delayed T cell reconstitution in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantations. The
mechanism driving of thymic aging and endogenous targets that can delay or reverse thymic involution remain
unknown. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) constitute a family of growth factors that regulate diverse biological
processes such as cell growth, development, differentiation. FGF21 is a unique metabolic hormone as it is
produced in response to caloric restriction to stimulate fatty acid oxidation, ketone body production and to
maintain homeostasis. Recent studies from our PPG team have demonstrated that overexpression of FGF21
protects against immune-senescence by increasing thymic function in aged mice. Notably, a major phenotype
of age-related thymic degeneration is loss of thymic epithelial cells, emergence of fibroblasts and the
accumulation of ectopic lipid within thymus. This project is based on our recent findings that FGF21
overexpression within thymus delays protects against loss of naïve T cells in aged mice and enhances their
healthspan. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that FGF21 activates sympathetic nervous system
(SNS) to induce fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis that consumes the ectopic lipid substrates in
immunological organs to protect against immune-senescence and inflammaging. This hypothesis will be
tested in collaboration with project 2 (metabolism), project 3 (SNS) and studies will be supported by Core A
and B. The, the long term goal of this project is to develop FGF21 agonists as clinical intervention to lower
inflammation and improve T cell dependent immune-surveillance in elderly."
10889152,"Project 2: Impact of Adipose Tissue-Derived FGF21 on Immune-Metabolic Control of Aging
Abstract
 Adipocytes secrete numerous lipid and protein factors with profound effects on systemic energy homeostasis.
One such adipokine that we first identified in the early 1990's, adiponectin (previously referred to as Acrp30),
has garnered significant attention as a potent mediator of insulin sensitivity and cell survival. FGF21 is another
factor that is secreted by a number of cell types (including adipocytes), which has a beneficial effect on
metabolism. During the initial funding period of this Program Project, our group generated a novel mouse model
that overexpresses, in an inducible fashion, physiological levels of FGF21 from adipocytes in the adult mouse.
While comparable levels of constitutive overexpression of FGF21 from the liver do not have an impact on aging
(Mangelsdorf/Kliewer; previous funding cycle), adipocyte-derived FGF21 exerts a profound beneficial impact on
health- and lifespan. This demonstrates that selective manipulation of adipose tissue per se has the potential to
significantly reduce mortality and extend lifespan. The adipocyte-specific FGF21 transgenic animals have
increased energy expenditure, weigh considerably less and exhibit an improvement in all systemic metabolic
parameters examined to date. The mice further display unique immune-metabolic profiles of their adipose tissue
depots, which defy the conventional changes associated with aging. Importantly, all these phenotypic alterations
are achieved without a significant impact on adipose tissue beiging/browning. In addition, we demonstrate that
further improvements on lifespan can be achieved in the absence of adiponectin, suggesting that adiponectin
may exert antagonistic effects on FGF21 action. Moreover, at least some beneficial aspects of FGF21 appear
to be mediated through a lowering of leptin, which leads to central leptin sensitization. As part of the continuation
of our programmatic efforts within this PPG, we will better define the changes that FGF21 introduces in adipose
tissue; primarily focusing on how this mechanistically leads to the dramatic effects on enhanced health- and
lifespan. We will further characterize the FGF21-induced improvements in adipocytes in the context of a whole
body knockout of FGF21, or in the absence of adiponectin and leptin. Alternatively, we will maintain leptin at
baseline levels during FGF21 overexpression. This will allow us to establish whether the metabolic
improvements are still possible without the drop in leptin. Finally, we will subject aged mice that overexpress
FGF21 in adipose tissue to single nuclei sequencing. This will entail using state-of-the-art metabolomics assays,
assessing senescence and turnover of adipocytes and, examining whether mice exhibit an altered exosomal
profile that is released into circulation.
 Combined, we hope these efforts will shed additional light on the physiological effects of FGF21. Furthermore,
we hope to establish the unique features and signatures that a fat-pad harbors, which are preserved during the
aging process in order to exert potent beneficial effects on health span and lifespan. These studies will be
performed in close collaboration with Project 1/Dixit and Project 3/Horvath-Schlessinger."
10889155,"Abstract- Project 3: The role of AgRP/Augα-ALK pathway in FGF21’s brain action on aging
During the past 5 years, we have shown that systemic adaptation to calorie restriction is hinging on appropriate
hypothalamic circuit activity and integrity. We specifically observed that these parameters impacted by FGF21
are critically regulated by hypothalamic AgRP neurons, which themselves are under the control of FGF21.
FGF21 induces activation of these hypothalamic neurons, which results in altered functional connectivity of
hypothalamic circuits in support of behavior and autonomic regulation. In line with the involvement with FGF21’s
action, our preliminary studies demonstrated that impaired AgRP circuit integrity shortens mean lifespan of male
mice when fed ad-libitum. Strikingly, however, shorter lifespan of AgRP-impaired animals showed significantly
lower disease burden, including dramatic lower incidence of neoplastic events in these animals. In pursuit of
this paradoxical outcome, we have investigated mechanisms that are innate to AgRP neurons with relevance to
cancer development. In collaboration between the labs of the PIs (Tamas Horvath and Joseph Schlessinger),
we unmasked a previously unsuspected cancer-related cellular signaling modality between AgRP neurons and
cells in the paraventricular nucleus in control of systemic energy and glucose metabolism. We found that AgRP
neurons metabolic state-dependently express Augmentor α (Augα), a recently discovered ligand of the receptor
tyrosine kinase, ALK. ALK is expressed in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, and, we found these cells
to be innervated by AgRP fibers originating in the arcuate nucleus. Knock down of Augα resulted in thinness,
which replicated the phenotype of ALK knockout animals. Our preliminary single cell RNAseq studies also
identified that the AgRP/Augα-ALK pathways is parallel but not overlapping in the PVN with that of AgRP-MC4R
pathway. Thus, we identified a novel signaling modality downstream of FGF21, which employs AgRP neurons
and a pathway (Augα-ALK) shown to be co-opted in etiology of multiple cancers. These observations gave
impetus to the central hypothesis of this project, which is that the Augα-ALK pathways originating in the
hypothalamic AgRP neurons impacts systemic action of FGF21, and, that this pathway is involved in AgRP circuit
integrity-dependent propagation of cancer development and lifespan.
The following Specific Aims will test these hypotheses:
Specific Aim 1 will determine whether Augα obstructs calorie restriction and FGF21-induced behavioral- and
peripheral tissue adaptations mediated by AgRP neurons.
Specific Aim 2 will assess the role of AgRP/Augα-ALK signaling pathway in in the effect of calorie restriction and
FGF21 on hippocampal and cortical circuit integrity.
Specific Aim 3 will interrogate the role of AgRP/Augα-ALK signaling pathway in lifespan in ad libitum fed, calorie
restricted and/or FGF21 treated mice.
The execution of these studies will deliver a novel therapeutic target for treatment of age-related tissue
malfunctions via a central node that is outside of the blood-brain-barrier."

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, have become the
greatest health threat for low and middle-income countries (LMIC). In Ghana, hypertension is recognized as a
major public health challenge. The ubiquity of mobile phones in Ghana and the popularity of mobile
communications make it possible to deliver mHealth interventions to our target population. However, there is
crucial gap in knowledge of the effectiveness of mobile health technology-based interventions for hypertension
management in SSA. The proposed AHOMKA mHealth platform is an evidence-based intervention to assist
with management of hypertension in an urban and rural region of Ghana. AHOMKA is adapted from the
Empower HealthTM system, a proprietary software application developed by Medtronic for direct patient-to-
provider communication via a mobile application and text messaging for hypertension management. This US-
Ghana collaborative R21/R33 research project will focus on adaptation of the Empower HealthTM system into
the local context in an urban and rural region of Ghana by multi-level engagement with stakeholders. We have
assembled a multi-national, multi-disciplinary team of researchers and medical device professionals with
expertise in mobile technology development, hypertension, cardiology, population studies, and public health
across multiple institutions in Ghana (University of Ghana, University of Health and Allied Sciences, Medtronic
Labs Ghana) and the USA (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Tufts University). The proposed feasibility
studies will be conducted at two large cardiovascular clinics in the Greater Accra region and the Volta region in
Ghana. Phase One aims to (1) implement a user-centered, iterative design approach to adapt the mHealth
platform based on feedback from stakeholders, and (2) conduct a 6-month usability and feasibility study with a
cohort of patients. Phase Two aims to conduct a 12-month feasibility study to assess change in blood
pressure among a cohort of patients in two regions of Ghana. In order to accelerate mobile health research in
Ghana, we propose to form the AHOMKA Research and Education Network as part of the strategic capacity
building plan."
10889008,"Activity in striated muscle is driven by changes in myoplasmic Ca2+ [Ca2+]i that arise largely from Ca2+ efflux
from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via the ryanodine receptor to initiate contraction, and reuptake of Ca2+
into the SR via the sarco-endoplasmic Ca2+ -ATPase (SERCA) to initiate relaxation. SERCA modulates [Ca2+]i
and the overall SR Ca2+ load, which in turn regulates contractile strength. SERCA binds to phospholamban
(PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN), which reduce its affinity for Ca2+. Phosphorylation of PLN or SLN alters their
interaction with SERCA that (after a short lag) increases its activity over a period of many minutes. Although
they would make excellent physiological sense, mechanisms to regulate SERCA at high frequencies (e.g.,
contraction to contraction) have not been described. Here we consider the hypothesis that the cytoskeleton
regulates SERCA1 in skeletal muscle on a msec time scale. We have shown that obscurin (Obscn) and small
ankyrin 1 (sAnk1) interact with PLN and SLN to regulate SERCA in skeletal muscle and heart. Obscn is an
~800 kDa cytoskeletal member of the titin superfamily that surrounds sarcomeres at M-bands and Z-disks.
sAnk1 (Ank1.5) is a ~17 kDa integral membrane protein and alternatively spliced product of the ANK1 gene
that concentrates in the SR around M-bands and Z-disks. Remarkably, sAnk1 binds Obscn, PLN, SLN and
SERCA directly. We show: (i) the 3-way complex of sAnk1, SERCA and SLN partially ablates SLN’s inhibition
of Ca2+-ATPase activity; (ii) Obscn increases the activity of SERCA bound to sAnk1 and SLN; (iii) sAnk1 binds
PLN; and (iv) a myopathic Obscn mutant increases SERCA activity by avidly binding PLN. Here we test
the novel hypothesis that Obscn and sAnk1 are biomechanical sensors that “tune” SERCA activity to the
mechanical stress of contraction. We posit a direct link from sarcomeres, thru Obscn to sAnk1 complexed with
SERCA and either SLN or PLN in the SR, such that contraction increases SERCA’s ATPase activity. We
consider 2 possible models: Model 1: Contraction leads to the dissociation of sAnk1 and SLN or PLN from
SERCA to activate it; Model 2: Contraction induces a conformational change in the complex to activate
SERCA. We will test our hypothesis and models in 4 Specific Aims: (1) To determine if sAnk1, P/SLN and
SERCA form complexes to regulate Ca2+-ATPase; (2) To determine if Obscn increases Ca2+-ATPase activity
by dissociating sAnk1 and PLN or SLN from SERCA, or by inducing a conformational change in the
complex; (3) To learn if the strength of contraction and the rates of Ca2+ clearance from the myoplasm are
governed by Obscn’s interactions with sAnk1 and PLN or SLN; and (4) To assess the effect of phosphorylation
on sAnk1’s role in regulating SERCA activity. These experiments have the potential to reveal novel
mechanisms regulating Ca2+ homeostasis in striated muscle, to offer fresh insights into the role that SERCA
plays in maintaining muscle health, and to suggest novel ways to manipulate SERCA’s activity to combat
myopathy."
10889009,"Project Summary
The long-term goal of the proposed research is to determine the central mechanisms by which
undernutrition and realimentation impact reproduction through regulation of gonadotropin-releasing
hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, using male and female sheep as an animal
model. Puberty onset integrates various internal and external cues resulting in an increased release of
GnRH from the hypothalamus that imparts the capacity for sexual maturation and reproductive success.
Inadequate energy intake (undernutrition) has a significant negative impact on GnRH, and subsequently
LH secretion, thereby delaying puberty onset. However, the central mechanisms responsible for the
suppression of GnRH/LH secretion during undernutrition or the increase of GnRH/LH secretion following
re-feeding (realimentation) remain largely unknown. Thus, the objectives of this proposal are 1) to
determine the role that AgRP signaling plays in regulating GnRH and kisspeptin neurons during
undernutrition and realimentation, and 2) to determine the role that microglia play in regulating GnRH and
kisspeptin neurons during undernutrition and realimentation. In Aim 1, we will characterize changes in
AgRP signaling in GnRH and kisspeptin neurons in feed-restricted (FR) sheep, examine the in vivo effect
of AgRP immunoneutralization in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus on LH secretion in FR
sheep, and characterize changes in AgRP signaling in GnRH and kisspeptin neurons in refed sheep. In
Aim 2, we will characterize changes central immune signaling in GnRH and kisspeptin neurons in FR
sheep, examine the in vivo effect of central infusion of an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist on LH secretion
in FR sheep, characterize changes in central immune signaling in GnRH and kisspeptin neurons in refed
sheep, and examine the in vitro effect of low glucose and insulin on microglia phenotype and function.
Herein, with our expertise in whole-animal physiology, in vivo drug delivery, immunohistochemistry, and in
vitro cell culture we have designed experiments to apply the highly innovative technique of a fluorescent
in situ hybridization assay, RNAscope, for detection of signaling components for AgRP (Aim 1) and
interleukin-1β (Aim 2). The proposed experiments will not only address the neuronal networks by which
changes in metabolic state impact reproduction, but also provide important insight into the role the immune
system likely plays. Thus, this work will provide a greater understanding of how undernutrition impacts
central networks that regulate GnRH/LH secretion and yield novel and critical insight that may allow for
better control of the timing of puberty, and ultimately lead to improved human health through prevention of
disorders (e.g. cardiovascular disease and depression) associated with delayed puberty."

Diastolic dysfunction (DD) and Heart failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) are
significant and hetetogenous causes of morbidity and mortality with few effective therapeutic
strategies. Increased understanding of HFpEF has been earmarked as a NIH research priority.
Two risk factors, fat and hypertension, are commonly found in cardiometabolic HFpEF patients,
and both independently associate with inflammation and DD. The extent of inflammation is a
critical determinant of the degree of cardiac fibrosis and myocardial stress that likely contributes
to impaired cardiac performance. As such, the resolution of inflmammation has the potential to
ameliorate myocardial pathophysiology. In this context, inflammatory immunometabolic
signaling has been linked with to the progression of disease, yet little is known with respect to
how immune metabolism regulates DD. This is particuarly true for myeloid cells and especially
the macrophage, in which immuonometabolic contriubtions to DD are either unknown or vague.
Our preliminary data point to signifcant mitochondrial stress in macrophages during DD. This is
an opportunity to combine improved basic understanding of basic cellular mechanisms with the
revealing on potential new metabolic therapeutic targets. In our first experimental Aim, we will
test the causal associations of myeloid lipid and mitochondrial metabolic pathways during
experimental DD. Aim II will elucidate cell-intrinsic immunometabolic macrophage signaling
networks that regulate pathways of inflammatory acceleration during DD-associated pathology.
Aim III will test the therapeutic proof of principle and clinical relevance of myeloid cell
metabolism during DD. Our Aims will leverage newly generated and cutting-edge experimental
tools and approaches. Taken together, these studies will provide new insight into the underlying
inflammatory mechanisms and therapeutic immune targets of DD and immunometabolic
signaling."

Genetically engineered T cells for DIPG
The overall objective of this study is to engineer an effective and safe chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell
therapy for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), a subgroup of diffuse midline gliomas for which currently there
is no cure. CAR T-cell therapy is an innovative technology based on adoptive transfer of antigen-specific T cells
engineered to elicit a clinically effective and specific immune response against tumor cells. Early clinical studies
in adult patients demonstrated the safety of CAR T-cell therapy for brain tumors, yet found only limited benefits.
This lack of efficacy is most likely multifactorial and includes T-cell exhaustion, the immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment, and the paucity of brain tumor-specific antigens. Thus, we propose to develop CAR T cells
targeting glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), a novel DIPG-specific antigen. To further improve the effector
function of GRP78-CAR T cells, we also propose to target a novel negative T-cell regulator called RASA2. We
hypothesize that CAR T cells targeting GRP78 on the surface of tumor cells and lacking RASA2 can be
developed as a safe, effective treatment for DIPGs and that evaluation of this intervention in DIPG mouse
models that closely mimic human disease will identify T-cell extrinsic negative regulators of CAR T-cell
function. Here we propose 3 interrelated Specific Aims to test this hypothesis. The rationale of each Aim is
outlined below. In Aim 1, we will first target GRP78 and optimize the CAR design. To that end, we will generate
CARs containing different co-stimulatory domains (41BB.ζ, MyD88.ζ, or MyD88.CD40.ζ) and compare their
activity in vitro. Then we will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the active CAR(s) in vivo by using
immunodeficient and immunocompetent mouse models of DIPG. A genome-wide screen in primary T cells has
identified key regulators of T-cell activation after T-cell receptor stimulation. One of the identified genes, RASA2,
has not been studied in T cells. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanism by which the deletion of RASA2
enhances the effector function of CAR T cells and then delete the gene from GRP78-CAR T cells to enhance
their function. Finally, in Aim 3, we will characterize the components of the DIPG microenvironment and examine
the interactions between endogenous DIPG immune cells and CAR T–cell treatment. State-of-the-art methods
will be used in all 3 Aims to study not only the function and in vivo fate of CAR T cells but also their antitumor
activity and how they interact with DIPG-infiltrating immune cells (i.e., macrophages, eosinophils, monocytes).
Our preliminary studies indicate that prototype GRP78-CAR T cells readily recognize and kill DIPG cells in vitro
and have antitumor activity against solid tumors in vivo, highlighting that the developed models are well suited
for the proposed Aims. To support the rapid translation of findings from this project to the clinical setting, we will
use multiple DIPG mouse models that closely recapitulate human disease. Upon completion of this study, we
will have defined the optimal GRP78-CAR design that safely eliminates DIPG tumors and persists long term in
the DIPG immune microenvironment."
10889178,"Project Summary:
 The focus of my research has been on the study of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This is a
deadly tumor that is predicted by 2020 to be the second leading cause of death in the U.S. The disease is
typically detected late in its course and unfortunately has proven to be highly treatment refractory to most
therapeutic approaches. Over the past decade, our group has been focused on understanding how PDAC
rewire their metabolism to support a high proliferative rate and cell survival in a nutrient poor, austere tumor
microenvironment. We have used novel mouse models to understand how oncogenic Kras, the signature
genetic mutation in PDAC, orchestrates metabolic reprogramming of these tumors towards a more anabolic
state. In fact, one of the critical ways that this oncogene supports pancreatic cancer growth is through its role
in tumor metabolism. Through further analysis of carbon source utilization in PDAC, we identified a novel
pathway that is critical for PDAC redox balance through the production of NADPH. This pathway utilizes
glutamine carbon and portions of the malate-aspartate shuttle ultimately ending with malic enzyme conversion
of malate to NADPH and pyruvate. Disruption at any node of this metabolic pathway results in redox imbalance
and decreased growth.
 One of the major themes that emerged from our work is that PDAC have an amazing metabolic plasticity.
This is likely an important adaptation to flourish in an environment where fuel sources and oxygen are rate
limiting and rapidly shifting. Understanding these adaptations will be essential in order to target metabolic
vulnerabilities for therapeutic gain. Indeed, we have shown that that these tumors can: 1) rapidly reprogram
their metabolic pathways in response to fuel source limitations, 2) use lysosomal scavenging pathways to
provide necessary metabolic intermediates, and 3) cooperate with stromal cells through novel metabolic
interactions. However, the integration of these metabolic adaptations and how this influences key metabolic
dependencies of PDAC in vivo is not yet known and will be critical to understand in order to develop effective
therapeutic approaches. Here, we will take a comprehensive approach to answer these key questions. We will
use sophisticated syngeneic models of pancreatic cancer to comprehensively assess metabolic dependencies
using a custom designed murine CRISPR metabolism library combined with metabolic tracer studies. We will
use co-culture systems to identify metabolic cross-talk between tumor cells and the multiple other cell types in
the tumor micro-environment (immunocytes, neurons, fibroblast populations). Using in vivo models, we will
dissect nutrient scavenging pathways and identify how these nutrients are utilized and potentially shared
between cell populations. Lastly, we will utilize the knowledge gained from these studies to develop the most
robust metabolic targets which will be tested in vivo using genetic and pharmacologic approaches."

All pathogens possess genetic diversity that can impact clinically relevant phenotypes such as virulence,

phenotype maps for traits of interest and hinders the development of broadly effective new antimicrobials,
vaccines, and public health interventions. To address this challenge, I developed a molecular barcoding
approach that permits parallel fitness phenotyping of hundreds of bacterial clinical isolates in a single in vitro or

and uncovered strain-specific differences in bacterial fitness during infection and following vaccination in the

Apathy is the most common and disabling of the behavioral symptoms shared across many Alzheimer's
Disease and Related Disorders (ADRDs), including behavioral variant frontotemporal degeneration (bvFTD).
Apathy manifests as a decrease in goal-directed behavior (GDB), with deficits such as poor planning, poor
motivation and inability to initiate even the simplest self-care activities, contribute to disability and greatly
reduced quality of life. Thus, apathy is a poor prognostic indicator, having a profound impact on clinical decline
in everyday patient functional activities. Recent work shows that apathy is associated with a disruption in
impairments in GDB--initiation, planning and motivation--suggesting that apathy is a heterogenous syndrome
with distinct underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, these functionally dissociable GDB processes map onto
distinct and distributed brain regions. While previous imaging efforts have predominantly focused on the
identification of structural MRI correlates of single brain regions involved in apathy, the overall goal of this
proposal is to investigate large-scale functional networks underlying impaired GDB in bvFTD--where apathy is
highly prevalent. Building on our previous work, the framework proposed here will capture the complex
associations of impaired GDB encompassing the various domains of apathy and will examine the ways the
breakdown of large-scale intrinsic networks can lead to the clinical syndrome of apathy. In Aim 1, we will study
how distinct impairments in GDB contribute to rate of longitudinal clinical decline in everyday functional
activities. In Aim 2, we will use resting-state fMRI to identify relationships between impaired GDB and
breakdown of large-scale neurocognitive networks. In Aim 3, we will examine how change in configuration of
functional network connectivity over time contributes to decline in components of GDB and we will assess how
degrading networks underlying GDB mediate rate of clinical decline in everyday functional activities. This
proposal addresses a critically unmet need to elucidate the role of degenerative disease in compromising the
network mechanisms that support goal-directed behavior in ADRD. Given the limited effectiveness of
pharmacological treatment for apathy in dementia, this translational work is necessary to guide future clinical
trials for this debilitating syndrome."

Photobiomodulation (PBM) for TMD pain. Also, we propose to determine if PBM-induced changes in
inflammation and pain sensitivity contribute to PBM’s analgesic effects. A total of 130 TMD participants will be
recruited through community-based advertisements. Participants will complete a computer-assisted telephone

(0-100). Participants will be excluded if: a) starting a new daily prescription medication for the management of
pain within 30 days before CATI; b) use of injection therapy (e.g., tender or trigger point injections, steroid
injections) for the management of pain within 2 weeks before the CATI; c) starting occlusal appliance therapy
within 30 days before CATI; d) history of facial trauma or orofacial surgery within 6 weeks before CATI; e) active
orthodontic treatment; f), psychiatric hospitalization within one year before the screening. Participants eligible
after CATI will be scheduled for a pre-randomization visit (V0), eight treatment visits (V1 to V8), one post-
treatment visit (V9), an internet/ phone follow-up at 1 and 3 months, and six-month follow-up clinical visit (V10).

interference, participants will complete the Pain, Enjoyment, General Activity (PEG) Scale followed by a clinical
exam to confirm TMD status according to the Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (DC/TMD), Pressure Pain Sensitivity
(PPT) and blood draw. V1 will be the randomization visit to either receive PBM or Placebo. V2-V8 are treatment
visits. V5 is also the Midway visit, therefore, a blood draw, DC/TMD exam and PPT will be performed before
treatment. At V9 (post-treatment visit), post-treatment outcomes will be assessed, PEG, DC/TMD exam, PPT
and a blood draw. PBM/Placebo treatment: We will use three types of active/Placebo probes; A) Single Laser
808 nm, 4.75W/cm 2; B) Laser Cluster, five x 810 nm, 5.96W/cm 2 and four LED 660nm, 0.05W/cm 2and; C) LED
Cluster, 56 X 660nm 0.51W/cm2 and 48 850nm, 0.45W/cm2, 950mW total applied to multiple craniofacial sites.
Analyses will determine treatment effects on the primary outcome (pain intensity) and multiple secondary
outcomes and will examine, exploratorily, whether changes in inflammation and pain sensitivity mediate
treatment response. Findings from this rigorously designed trial will provide the most definitive evidence to date
regarding the effectiveness and mechanisms of PBM for treating TMD pain."
10889281,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stroke is the fifth most prevalent cause of death in the U.S. afflicting nearly 800,000 per year. About three
quarters of strokes are first events, underscoring the importance of primary prevention. Designing optimal
preventive strategies requires identification of risk factors and estimation of the risk of stroke. The most recent
American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association Guidelines for the Primary Prevention of
Stroke conclude that “an ideal stroke risk assessment tool that is simple, is widely applicable and accepted,
and takes into account the effects of multiple risk factors does not exist.” One of the most commonly
recommended predictive models is the Framingham Stroke Profile, developed and updated more than 25
years ago. Newer models have been proposed (including the Self-Reported Stroke Risk Stratification tool from
the REGARDS study) but have not been thoroughly validated. Consequently, the Primary Prevention of Stroke
guidelines call for more research “to validate risk assessment tools across age, sex, and race/ethnic groups”
and “to evaluate whether any of the more recently identified risk factors add to the predictive accuracy of
existing scales”.
We propose to address these gaps by aggregating and harmonizing existing patient-level data collected as
part of longitudinal cohort studies supported by the NINDS and NHLBI. The data will be obtained through a
partnership with the coordinating center for the REGARDS Study at the University of Alabama at Birmingham
and by a request submitted to the NIH dbGap repository to obtain data from the Framingham Offspring, ARIC
and MESA cohorts. At the same time, we will expand the advanced machine learning techniques developed
as part of our currently funded NIH BD2K award to Duke. We will apply these models to the harmonized data
to facilitate development and validation of prediction tool for primary strokes. These complex analyses will
require advanced computational resources that will utilize the AHA's Precision Medicine Platform (PMP), built
based on Amazon Web Services."
10889102,"As many as ~3 million individuals suffer from epileptic seizures in the US alone. Although some forms of epilepsy
respond quite well to anti-seizure medications, a substantial portion of individuals suffering from epilepsy do not
respond well to medication or dietary treatments. One way to investigate the underlying molecular and cellular
pathology of seizure disorder is by studying a genetically defined syndrome where epilepsy is a prominent feature.
Approximately 25-50% of individuals with Duplication 15q syndrome (Dup15q) suffer from difficult to control
seizures. The prevailing hypotheses to explain seizures in Dup15q are maternal specific neuronal elevation of
the ubiquitin E3 ligase UBE3A and/or duplication of a cluster of GABA receptor genes located adjacent to UBE3A
at 15q11.2-q13.1. Studies using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, from our laboratory indicates that these
seizures may be caused by elevated levels of UBE3A in glia, not neurons as previously proposed. The premise
for this proposal is that seizures are caused by elevated levels of the UBE3A protein in glia, not neurons,
providing not only a pathway to molecular mechanism for Dup15q related epilepsy, but also a paradigm shift,
directly implicating glial cells in the etiology of seizures. The experiments outlined in this proposal are designed
to investigate the developmental timing and molecular changes in glial cells over-expressing Dube3a and to
reveal how these changes are recapitulated in a new mouse model we developed that expresses Ube3a in glial
cells. Everything we learn from these studies in flies will be directly disseminated to a team of seizure experts
who work at the Duplication 15q centers of excellence throughout the country. The identification of new
therapeutic targets for Dup15q epilepsy may also provide new treatment options to individuals who are
pharmacoresistant to current anti-epileptics."
10888327,"Cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) neurons project throughout the neocortex, hippocampus, and amygdala to
modulate perceptual salience and regulate synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory. CBF research
has focused on rostral regions, including the medial septum, nuclei of the diagonal band, and nucleus basalis
(NB). The caudal extreme of the basal forebrain has been largely overlooked, yet our research suggests that
this caudal tail region – much like the tail of the striatum – can be conceptualized as a distinct functional
subdomain with categorically different response properties than more rostral regions. The projections of CBF
tail neurons (CBFt) are concentrated in two regions: the auditory cortex (ACtx) and the thalamic reticular
nucleus (TRN). Our published and preliminary recordings from CBFt neurons in passively listening mice reveal
surprisingly strong, short-latency, low-threshold responses to a broad class of auditory stimuli that have no
explicit behavioral relevance. Comparable responses are not observed for stimuli in other modalities or from
more rostral CBF neurons. CBFt sound responses are not stable, but instead are rapidly and selectively
enhanced for threat-predicting sounds during Pavlovian and instrumental learning paradigms. Thus, our
studies of the tail region suggest a different model for cholinergic modulation of cortical sound processing in
which the ACtx is continuously bombarded by sound-triggered acetylcholine (ACh) surges that reorganize
during learning to highlight relevant sounds and guide cortical receptive field plasticity. Here, we describe three
specific aims for the coming project period that will illuminate how the CBFt regulates thalamocortical sound
processing, perceptual awareness of sound, and associative plasticity during auditory learning. Studies in Aim
1 will test an inverted-U hypothesis for cholinergic modulation of sound processing, which holds that sensory
tuning in the primary ACtx (A1) and TRN become imprecise and unreliable during transient peaks and troughs
of local endogenous ACh release. Further, we predict that these effects can be accounted for – in part – by the
particularly strong influence of CBFt-mediated ACh release on A1 layer 6 corticothalamic neurons, as tested by
studies in both intact and acute thalamocortical brain slice preparations. Aim 2 will extend these ideas to the
behavioral domain by showing that occasional lapses in thalamocortical encoding and perceptual awareness of
target sounds (i.e., miss trials) can be attributed to stochastic peaks and troughs in CBFt-mediated ACh levels
immediately preceding target sound onset. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that enhanced CBFt responses to
sounds associated with aversive – but not appetitive – reinforcement is sufficient to shift A1 sound
representations from a mode of net stability to heightened plasticity that supports associative auditory learning.
These hypotheses will be tested through the combined application of genetically encoded ACh sensor imaging,
optogenetics, multi-regional single unit recordings, and 2-photon calcium imaging of CBFt or NB axons in
awake transgenic mice during voluntary and involuntary behavioral reporting of sound perception."
10888330,"Project Summary
 The study of animal viruses has been critical for understanding basic disease mechanisms, including the
pathogenesis of related human viruses. This Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award
proposal presents a five-year research program to study the mechanisms by which a novel parvovirus
successfully replicates in terminally differentiated hepatocytes. Equine parvovirus-Hepatitis (EqPV-H), a novel
Copiparvovirus, is known to cause hepatitis and fulminant hepatic necrosis in horses. Preliminary data
demonstrate multiple similarities between EqPV-H in horses and parvovirus B19 in humans, including high
prevalence in clinically healthy individuals and rare but important associations with fulminant hepatitis.
Parvoviruses utilize either the host cell replication machinery or the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway to
replicate their viral genomes. The foundation for this proposal is based on studies evaluating the cellular division
status of hepatocytes infected with EqPV-H following experimental inoculation in vivo that suggest that cells with
viral replication are most commonly in G0 phase of the cell cycle.
 This proposal will address the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the cellular division and DNA
damage response (DDR) status of EqPV-H-infected hepatocytes and association with pathology in situ; Aim 2)
Evaluate the impact of DNA damage-induced DDR activation and DDR inhibition on EqPV-H replication and
hepatotoxicity in vitro; and Aim 3) Determine the role of host cell polymerases in EqPV-H replication in vitro.
These aims align with Dr. Jager’s career development goals: 1) Training in cell culture development and
optimization; 2) Training in molecular virology, cell biology, and toxicology; and 3) Training in confocal
microscopy and spatial transcriptomics. To achieve these goals, Dr. Jager has assembled a highly qualified team
of mentors including: his primary mentor, Dr. Gerlinde Van de Walle, a veterinary clinician-basic scientist with
expertise in viral pathogenesis and development of novel cell culture systems; co-mentor Dr. Colin Parrish, a
skilled molecular virologist with extensive parvovirus research experience; and co-mentor Dr. Robert Weiss with
expertise in the DDR pathway. Additionally, the team includes collaborators with expertise in parvoviral
replication dynamics, hepatopathology, and equine parvovirus.
 The candidate plans to submit grants for further federal funding, including an R21 or R01 in the fourth
year, with the goal of achieving independence. This K08 award will allow Dr. Jager to develop a sub-specialty in
hepatopathology and viral pathogenesis that will help launch his academic career as an independent clinician-
scientist."
10886475,"Abstract
Significance: Although current patient simulators have demonstrated improved learning
outcomes in medical training, there is a significant lack of realism. Thus, they do not effectively
provoke a realistic emotional response in trainees. This significantly limits their educational value
to the emergency medical service (EMS) training agencies, as does – in the case of mannequins
– their cost, reliance on electricity, and lack of portability. To address these significant limitations
of the current medical patient simulators, the PI developed PerSim, a commercial patient
simulator product using mixed reality (MR), which includes HAZMAT signs and symptoms.
However, additional research and development is needed to effectively support HAZMAT
treatments. Commercial Need: Since being released in 4th quarter 2017, there are over 100
institutions that have purchased PerSim for $20-30K each, on average, including a $12K per year
subscription fee, and are using the system for emergency medicine and HAZMAT training. Based
on interviews with our customers and individuals at emergency medicine training agencies, MR-
based simulated HAZMAT treatments will address a critical need in HAZMAT education.
Preliminary Data: The PI developed PerSim, an MR-based patient simulator that can be used in
person or remotely over the internet. Via the Microsoft HoloLens 2 MR display, the system projects
high-resolution, realistic animations of a patient onto any surface a trainee chooses such as low-
fidelity mannequin as a physical reference for haptic input during procedures. The instructor uses
a handheld tablet as both a controller for the simulation and an automated assessment system to
track trainee performance. The system utilizes another tablet to act as a defibrillator and a
physiologic monitor to provide real-time vital sign and heart rhythm data. The system’s control
interfaces and registration algorithms are patented. Specific Aims: This project proposes to
develop and evaluate interactive, virtual autoinjectors and patches for HAZMAT treatments in the
PI's innovative MR-based patient simulator, PerSim. In Specific Aim 1, the PI will work with
medical artists and a HAZMAT educator co-I to create realistic treatments and integrate them with
the PerSim system. The PI plans to develop autoinjector and patches textures and models based
on NFPA 472 Standard for Competence of Responders to Hazardous Materials, specifically to
treat poisonous gas inhalation, corrosive materials, and poisonous materials. In Specific Aim 2,
the PI will evaluate the usability and realism of the HAZMAT treatments with HAZMAT instructors
and students."
10887026,"Rebecca Haberman, MD, MSCI is an Assistant Professor (tenure track) in the Division of Rheumatology at NYU
Grossman School of Medicine. Dr. Haberman has a Master’s degree in Clinical Investigation and, despite her
early career stage, has been remarkably prolific with multiple first author publications in high impact journals and
has received competitive extramural funding from NIH/NIAMS (T32 grant), the National Psoriasis Foundation,
and the Rheumatology Research Foundation. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent
investigator who leads both clinical and epidemiologic innovative studies at the intersection of psoriatic disease
and determinants of inflammatory and non-inflammatory pain. Dr. Haberman, together with an expert mentorship
team, guided by Drs. Jose U. Scher and Alexis Ogdie, have designed a career development plan intended to
lead to independence by the end of the K23 award period, including training in outcomes research, advanced
epidemiologic methods, statistical modeling, and clinical trial development as well as developing a fundamental
framework in which to study pain using neuroimaging and validated tools in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Her work
will be supported by a diverse team of collaborators who have specific areas of expertise in biostatistics,
neuroradiology, pain, and behavioral health and have long committed to helping Dr. Haberman achieve her goal
of independence. Through this award, she will cement her niche within rheumatology and acquire the data and
publications necessary to support a strong R01 application(s). In this proposal, Dr. Haberman seeks to
understand the clinical and physiologic basis of persistent joint pain in patients who have seemingly controlled
inflammation. To do so she proposes to: a) define the prevalence and clinical drivers of persistent joint pain, b)
interrogate the biologic underpinnings of persistent pain using advanced neuroimaging, and c) identify predictive
factors of persistent pain prior to the initiation of PsA treatment. The scientific premise is that while the pain
experience in PsA is mediated by both inflammatory and non-inflammatory processes, persistent pain is largely
non-inflammatory in nature. The central hypothesis posits that, in PsA, a significant proportion of patients
experience persistent joint pain which prevents the achievement of remission unless an effective pain-mitigating
therapy is used as a co-adjuvant. Aim 1 will define the prevalence, phenotype, and drivers of persistent pain in
a large and diverse PsA cohort. Aim 2 will employ neuroimaging (functional brain MRIs) cross-sectionally to
characterize neuroconnectivity differences between patients in full remission and those with persistent joint pain.
Aim 3 will follow newly diagnosed, treatment naïve patients with PsA to assess predictors of having persistent
pain at 6 months after exposure to biologic treatments (including integration of clinical tools with
neuroconnectivity features). The successful completion of the proposed project will provide Dr. Haberman with
a unique perspective and robust tools to study the clinical and neuroimaging features that can serve as the basis
for personalized therapies in PsA, and constitute the foundation of a future competitive R01 grant application."
10887174,"Project Summary/Abstract
Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a clonal expansion of hematopoietic cells, and progression
leads to deposition of collagen fibers throughout the blood-forming spaces of the bone marrow. In advanced
cases, this causes bony replacement of the marrow cavity, blood maturation outside the bone marrow
(extramedullary hematopoiesis), and transformation to fatal acute leukemia. Stromal cells normally form a
hematopoietic niche to support hematopoietic stem cells, but in MPNs these cells are reprogrammed to produce
overwhelming collagen. We dissected the signals from abnormal hematopoietic cells in MPNs that target bone
marrow stromal cells, disrupting their ability to support normal hematopoiesis. We recently reported that
transforming growth factor-J3 (TGF-J3) promotes collagen deposition and suppresses expression of key niche
factors by bone marrow stromal cells. Moreover, blockade of TGF-J3 signaling in stromal cells can reverse bone
marrow fibrosis in mouse models of MPN. However, when TGF-J3 signaling is blocked there is still disruption of
the hematopoietic niche and development of extramedullary hematopoiesis. To identify additional signals that
disrupt the hematopoietic niche in MPNs, I isolated stromal cells from patient bone marrow samples and identified
candidate signaling pathways that alter the bone marrow microenvironment. Based on these data, I hypothesize
that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) contribute to loss of niche
factors. In Aim 1, I will define the role of PDGF receptor signaling in bone marrow stromal populations in MPNs.
Using mouse models to abrogate signaling through the two PDGF receptors in bone marrow stromal cells, I will
transplant mouse cells with MPL w515
L or JAK2v61 7
F mutations to model MPNs. I will assess hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cells, extramedullary hematopoiesis, niche factor expression, fibrosis, and survival. In Aim 2, I
will define the role of TNF receptor signaling in bone marrow stromal populations in MPNs. I will abrogate TNF
signaling through the two TNF receptors in stromal cells and use MPN transplant models to assess the impact
on hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, niche factor expression, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and fibrosis.
Achieving these aims will improve our understanding of alterations in the bone marrow microenvironment through
TNF and PDGF that lead to disease progression in MPNs. These insights will refine therapeutic targeting for
more effective interventions to improve outcomes for patients. The overall goal is to establish an independent
research laboratory studying contributions of the bone marrow microenvironment to normal and malignant
hematopoiesis. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan to acquire advanced skills including innovative
approaches in hematopoiesis and MPNs. The primary mentor is Dr. Daniel Link, a distinguished scientist in
hematopoiesis, bone marrow microenvironment, and myeloid neoplasms, with a committee of Drs. Tim Ley,
Stephen Oh, and Grant Challen for scientific and career development advising. Washington University is an
exceptional environment for training with strong collaborations to gain expertise in stem cell biology and MPNs."

The overall purpose of this K01 proposal is to provide the PI with the essential mentorship, career development,
and research experience necessary to become an independent clinical and translational investigator in Geriatric
Nephrology. The candidate’s long-term goal is to build an NIH-funded independent research program
investigating novel mechanisms and treatment targets to improve health outcomes in older patients with chronic
kidney disease (CKD).
To that end, the PI proposes a career development plan that will provide 1) new expertise in Geriatrics,
autonomic physiology and imaging biomarkers as research tools; 2) scientific growth through a rigorous
training plan supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team; and 3) didactic training in clinical research
design and analysis through the Master of Science in Clinical Research (MSCR) offered by the Georgia
Clinical and Translational Science Alliance (GA CTSA). The research training and project will leverage the vast
resources of Emory University, a world-class academic medical center with innovative scientific research
laboratories and neighboring medical facilities that enable rapid translation of novel ideas. The goals of the
proposed research project are to identify neural and vascular mechanisms contributing to accelerated
deterioration of kidney function in older patients with CKD. The prevalence and incidence of CKD are
substantially higher in older adults, and elderly CKD patients have faster declines in kidney function that lead to
increased risk of kidney failure, mortality, and poor quality of life. The central hypothesis is that older adults
with CKD have exaggerated renal hemodynamic reactivity to sympathetic activation, which in turn is
associated with faster kidney function decline over time. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will determine if older
patients with CKD have exaggerated reductions in renal blood flow, and impaired renal oxygenation that is
related to sympathetic nervous system over-activation. These studies will measure renal hemodynamics and
sympathetic nerve activity using direct intraneural recordings of sympathetic nerve activity in vivo, and
comprehensive imaging biomarkers to quantify changes in renal blood flow and oxygenation. In addition to the
mechanistic insights that will be examined in Aim 1, Aim 2 will use a longitudinal prospective study design to
explore the potential impact of sympathetic overactivity on CKD progression, by exploring if heightened
sympathetic activation and renal vasoconstriction are associated with faster rate of kidney function decline over
time in older CKD patients. The results from these studies will provide the foundation for a future NIH R01
grant that will include prospective studies to improve long-term kidney outcomes in older patients with CKD.
This research project, combined with multidisciplinary mentorship, didactic education, and practical experience,
will provide Dr. Jeong with the training and skills to become a successful independent investigator."
10887231,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The NIDA K23 Award proposes innovative research in opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment linkage after
release from incarceration. Recently incarcerated individuals are at significantly increased risk for overdose
death. Despite the clear benefits of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), uptake is low among
individuals with criminal-legal involvement (CLI). A critical knowledge gap that remains is how to overcome the
multiple structural barriers to post-release treatment engagement that lead to overdose-related morbidity and
mortality for this marginalized population. Telehealth-delivered buprenorphine may address gaps in provider
availability, competing social determinants of health, and access inequities related to buprenorphine treatment.
Interventions utilizing telehealth must be targeted to the specific needs of individuals with CLI and engage
relevant stakeholders across correctional and community settings. The objective of this application is to
develop a tele-buprenorphine clinical protocol to improve post-release treatment engagement. Specific aims
include:1) Identify rates and predictors of post-release buprenorphine treatment linkage among individuals with
OUD after jail incarceration; 2) Examine the perspectives of individuals with OUD and CLI, clinicians, and
administrators to inform the development of a tele-buprenorphine protocol for low-threshold treatment linkage
among jail-released adults; and 3) Conduct a pilot randomized-controlled trial utilizing tele-buprenorphine for
post-release treatment linkage among adults with OUD upon release from jail. An Intervention Mapping
protocol incorporating input from relevant stakeholders will be utilized to develop the intervention. These aims
will identify the target population and assess the needs and objectives of stakeholders, support the
development and testing of study measures, and assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy
of the intervention. The proposed research will lead to an R01 randomized controlled trial to test the impact of
tele-buprenorphine on post-incarceration OUD treatment linkage, retention, and CLI outcomes. The mentorship
team brings together experts in health equity, health services research, clinical trials, addiction medicine,
substance use epidemiology, and correctional health care, as well as stakeholder advisors from correctional
health and reentry settings. This award will allow Dr. Utsha Khatri to develop as a clinician-investigator through
the pursuance of four training goals: 1) Develop advanced knowledge of correctional health care and addiction
treatment care transitions during reentry 2) Acquire advanced quantitative skills for clinical outcome
assessment using linked, administrative datasets 3) Design and conduct clinical trials on care delivery
interventions to address the needs of marginalized groups and 4) Attain grant writing and project management
skills to transition to independence. With the successful completion of this project, training activities, and
mentorship from a team of experienced investigators, Dr. Khatri will be exceptionally well prepared to lead an
independent research agenda designed to improve care and outcomes for individuals with CLI and addiction."

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are transforming clinical care for hematological malignancies, spurring
numerous efforts to expand their use for different cancer types and applications. However, this success has not
reliably translated to solid tumors, including breast cancer. Following adoptive transfer, a small fraction of CAR
T cells manage to infiltrate tumor sites and the tumor microenvironment (TME) is highly immunosuppressive.
Co-administration of biologics to enhance trafficking or to overcome the TME (e.g., cytokines or immune check-
point inhibitors) have the potential to enhance CAR T cell activity. However, they affect both CAR and endoge-
nous T cells populations, which can lead to off-target killing, systemic toxicities, and limited therapeutic windows.
Moreover, noninvasive biomarkers of CAR T cell infiltration and trafficking are needed to assess early on treat-
ment response. This proposal seeks to improve overall safety and efficacy of CAR T cell therapy against solid
tumors by utilizing CAR T cells, simultaneously tagged with gold nanorods (AuNRs) and engineered with thermal
gene switches (TGSs), by 1) confirming AuNR-TGS-CAR T cell infiltration at the tumor site using a combined
ultrasound and photoacoustic (US/PA) imaging system, and 2) achieving precisely controlled local immune cell
activation and therapy by mild heating of TGS-CAR T cells using focused ultrasound (FUS) guided by US/PA
and thermal (US/PA/TH) imaging platform. TGS are genetic constructs that are transcriptionally inactive at body
temperature but undergo a sharp thermal transition at 40–42°C to trigger transgene expression to levels greater
than 200-fold above basal levels. TGS allows thermal targeting of tumors to activate infiltrated CAR T cells to
locally produce potent therapeutic genes that would otherwise be toxic when administered systemically. The
US/PA/TH imaging platform will confirm cell infiltration, guide FUS delivery of heat by noninvasive mapping of
local temperatures within the tumor microenvironment, and quantify key biomarkers of therapy response. These
synergistic advances in CAR T cell engineering and imaging will be tested in the context of HER2-CAR T cells
for breast cancer where approximately 30 percent of patients carry an amplification of the HER2 gene and/or
HER2 over-expression. Preclinical evaluation of the image-guided CAR T cell therapy approach will be per-
formed in a syngeneic model of mammary adenocarcinoma by orthotopic injection of E0771 tumor cells express-
ing human HER2 into B6-HER2 transgenic mice. HER2-CAR T cells will be engineered with TGS that control
stimulatory cytokine IL-15SA. The successful completion of our studies will result in a new class of image-guided
CAR T cell therapy to improve response against breast tumors while limiting systemic toxicity. The advances
developed through these studies can be extended to other CAR T cell receptors against other cancer types."

The study of the human temporal bone has proven to be incredibly powerful and is responsible for much of what
we know about the anatomy and pathology of the ear. However, propagation of otopathology research has been
hampered by barriers that affect every step of the research chain (procurement, processing, distribution, and
dissemination). The major goals of this project are to propagate the use of human temporal bones for research
and training through the establishment of our lab as national resource for temporal bone expertise and to become
part of the collaborative network to be established by the NIDCD to serve the auditory and vestibular research
communities. These goals will be achieved through 4 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will establish a core
service for processing and distribution of high-quality temporal bone tissue. We will leverage our high
procurement capacity, digitization of our collection, and technical experience to implement a structured approach
for prioritizing and processing human temporal bones that are of special scientific interest to meet research
needs of the scientific community. In Specific Aim 2, we will optimize human temporal bone preparation
techniques to reduce processing costs and time and improve the capacity to retain, preserve, and extract proteins
and DNA/RNA. We will investigate technologies for improving the speed and quality achieved during fixation,
embedding, decalcification, sectioning, and visualization. In Specific Aim 3, we will provide technical instruction
on the processing and use of human temporal bones for the scientific and clinical communities. Innovative hybrid
educational modules will be employed, and all materials, training, and protocols will be freely disseminated to
increase the number of well-trained technicians and researchers. In Specific Aim 4, we will provide outreach to
the scientific and clinical communities to disseminate and promote the use of human temporal bones in research.
This will be achieved in-person at major scientific meetings and virtually using multiple multimedia resources.
Our multidisciplinary team of experienced investigators has the necessary knowledge and skills aligned with
ample resources (large archival collection, high procurement capacity of high-quality temporal bones, highly
skilled team of technicians, internal distribution services to send biological specimens), collaborations with
centers of excellence for imaging and tissue processing, and innovative educational and audiovisual services to
provide the necessary means to propagate and take temporal bone research to the next level."
10888217,"Chronic kidney disease is present in a large proportion of adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and is
associated with increased morbidity and early mortality. The mechanisms for how chronic kidney disease
develops are, unfortunately, poorly understood and therapies to prevent and treat sickle cell nephropathy are
urgently needed. This proposal will leverage robust preliminary data from the applicant's K23 and R03 awards
to innovatively address the mechanistic pathways and susceptibilities for kidney disease and investigate
targeted interventions to mitigate kidney damage in SCD. The underlying hypothesis is that cell-free
hemoglobin mediates damage to the kidney cortex and microvasculature if not efficiently scavenged and
processed. The applicant will apply exciting preliminary data to test this hypothesis via three specific aims.
Specific aim #1 will determine whether functional variants in HP, the main scavenger of cell-free hemoglobin
in circulation, and HMOX1, the rate limiting enzyme for degrading heme, are associated with acute kidney
injury risk during a vaso-occlusive crisis, when concentrations of cell-free hemoglobin increase approximately
2-fold. Specific aim #2 will determine whether cell-free hemoglobin leads to kidney microvascular dysfunction
through aberrant function of thrombomodulin, an endothelial bound protein critical for maintaining vascular
health. Specific aim #3 will investigate whether voxelotor, an oral small molecular inhibitor of sickle
hemoglobin polymerization and hemolysis, reduces cell-free hemoglobin exposure and damage to the kidney
in transgenic sickle mice.
Integrating genetic analyses of cell-free hemoglobin processing with therapies to improve vascular function or
reduce cell-free hemoglobin exposure to the kidney will lead to a deeper understanding for the mechanisms of
kidney damage and guide individualized and preventive therapeutic strategies for sickle cell nephropathy. This
research team is exceptionally positioned to achieve the goals outlined in this proposal through a strong history
of productivity and the institutional environment. The University of Illinois at Chicago Comprehensive Sickle
Cell Center cares for over 800 SCD patients and has a long-standing tradition of successful implementation of
research studies. At the present time, there are only limited therapeutic options available to treat SCD.
Developing a better understanding of the susceptibilities and pathways for kidney disease may potentially have
a significant impact on this underserved high risk population."

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-wrapped structures containing proteins, RNAs, lipids, and
metabolites that are released from most if not all cell types to mediate intercellular communication. Roles for EVs
in physiological processes as well as pathological conditions including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer
have been established. Given the presence of EVs in diverse body fluids, there is also great interest in using
these vesicles as biomarkers for disease detection and engineering EVs for therapeutics.
Investigation of the release of EVs containing fluorescently-tagged cargo from identified cells in the model system
C. elegans can provide insight into unresolved questions concerning conserved mechanisms of EV biogenesis
and cargo selection in vivo. We discovered that the calcium homeostasis modulator ion channel CLHM-1 is cargo
in EVs released from cilia of male-specific sensory neurons. Remarkably, when we coexpressed tdTomato-
tagged CLHM-1 with GFP-tagged PKD-2, a known EV cargo protein expressed in the same neurons, we rarely
observed colocalization of the fluorescent proteins in vesicles, suggesting that CLHM-1 and PKD-2 are in distinct
EV subpopulations. We have found that the PKD-2 and CLHM-1 containing EVs do not utilize the same
biogenesis and release mechanisms, are discharged in different quantities, and do not have the same
physiological function. Our overarching goal is to draw upon the strengths of our genetic system and cutting
edge imaging and mass spectrometry approaches to define mechanisms underlying formation of EV
subpopulations and the physiological significance of EV heterogeneity.
Our proposed research will utilize our unique transgenic animals that express fluorescently tagged EV cargoes
at endogenous levels. Advanced imaging techniques including confocal microscopy with Airyscan detection and
immunogold labeling for transmission electron microscopy will enable us to characterize the size, morphology,
and ciliary release site(s) of EVs as well as the impact of lateral lipid asymmetry in the ciliary membrane on cargo
sorting. Through a candidate approach, we will define the role of flippases, floppases and scramblases, which
control transbilayer lipid asymmetry, in the biogenesis of the EV subsets. We will then explore how cellular stress
conditions that disrupt plasma membrane phospholipid homeostasis impact EV cargo sorting and release. To
identify other cargoes in the CLHM-1 EV subset, we will perform mass spectrometry on GFP-tagged CLHM-1
vesicles isolated by flow cytometry. Finally, we will identify the hermaphrodite-derived stimulus that induces an
increase in formation of CLHM-1 containing EVs from male ciliated neurons as well as the importance of EV
release for animal communication and ciliary function. This work will lead to an understanding of how an
individual cell generates heterogeneous EV populations with different physiological functions, impacting broadly
on our comprehension of basic biogenesis and cargo sorting mechanisms utilized in vivo."

these vesicles as biomarkers for disease detection and engineering EVs for therapeutics.
Investigation of the release of EVs containing fluorescently-tagged cargo from identified cells in the model system
C. elegans can provide insight into unresolved questions concerning conserved mechanisms of EV biogenesis
and cargo selection in vivo. We discovered that the calcium homeostasis modulator ion channel CLHM-1 is cargo
in EVs released from cilia of male-specific sensory neurons. Remarkably, when we coexpressed tdTomato-
tagged CLHM-1 with GFP-tagged PKD-2, a known EV cargo protein expressed in the same neurons, we rarely
observed colocalization of the fluorescent proteins in vesicles, suggesting that CLHM-1 and PKD-2 are in distinct
EV subpopulations. We have found that the PKD-2 and CLHM-1 containing EVs do not utilize the same
biogenesis and release mechanisms, are discharged in different quantities, and do not have the same
physiological function. Our overarching goal is to draw upon the strengths of our genetic system and cutting
edge imaging and mass spectrometry approaches to define mechanisms underlying formation of EV
subpopulations and the physiological significance of EV heterogeneity.
Our proposed research will utilize our unique transgenic animals that express fluorescently tagged EV cargoes
at endogenous levels. Advanced imaging techniques including confocal microscopy with Airyscan detection and
immunogold labeling for transmission electron microscopy will enable us to characterize the size, morphology,
and ciliary release site(s) of EVs as well as the impact of lateral lipid asymmetry in the ciliary membrane on cargo
sorting. Through a candidate approach, we will define the role of flippases, floppases and scramblases, which
control transbilayer lipid asymmetry, in the biogenesis of the EV subsets. We will then explore how cellular stress
conditions that disrupt plasma membrane phospholipid homeostasis impact EV cargo sorting and release. To
identify other cargoes in the CLHM-1 EV subset, we will perform mass spectrometry on GFP-tagged CLHM-1
vesicles isolated by flow cytometry. Finally, we will identify the hermaphrodite-derived stimulus that induces an
increase in formation of CLHM-1 containing EVs from male ciliated neurons as well as the importance of EV
release for animal communication and ciliary function. This work will lead to an understanding of how an
individual cell generates heterogeneous EV populations with different physiological functions, impacting broadly
on our comprehension of basic biogenesis and cargo sorting mechanisms utilized in vivo."

The human genome contains the structural and operational instructions for living cells, yet exactly what these
instructions are and how they are utilized and encoded in the primary genomic sequence is poorly understood.
Arguably the only well-understood portions of the genome are protein-coding regions, which make up less than
2% of the genome. It has become increasingly clear that the non-coding genome encodes vast numbers of
regulatory elements important for controlling gene expression levels in a cell type specific manner. Moreover,
the overwhelming majority of disease- and trait-associated variants identified by genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) lie in non-coding regions of the genome, and are strongly enriched in regulatory elements.
Despite this clear relevance, we still lack a complete understanding of the global organizing principles of the
regulatory genome, such as how regulatory elements are distributed across the genome, what their occurrence
patterns are across cell types, and how they are encoded in the genomic sequence. We hypothesize that the
main reason for our limited understanding is not lack of data, but that most data sets are generated and
ultimately analyzed in isolation, limiting their full potential. To further our understanding of the organizing
principles of the regulatory genome, it is therefore essential to take an ​en masse approach to data analysis,
exploiting the dynamics across large numbers of observations. In this project, we will use this notion to
develop methods for defining the first comprehensive and pragmatically useful human regulatory genome
annotation based on the coordinated occurrence patterns of regulatory elements across hundreds of cell types
and states. Beyond individual elements, we will define multi-kilobase domains of shared regulatory activity,
which will shed light on the regulatory landscapes around genes and higher-order regulatory domains. In
addition, we will integrate regulatory annotations with orthogonal information based on functional genomics
chromatin state data to arrive at a rich composite view of the regulatory genome. Lastly, we will develop the
first fully data-driven system for designing and validating context-specific synthetic regulatory elements. We
anticipate that our results will provide a new lens on the human regulatory genome, which will open up new
research avenues in the areas of systems and synthetic biology, ultimately contributing to the understanding
and treatment of human disease. We are determined to provide the genomics community with pragmatically
useful regulatory genome annotations and tools to utilize these resources."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes tuberculosis in humans.
Tuberculosis remains a major global public health threat. Annually, there are approximately 10 million active
tuberculosis cases and 1.4 million deaths worldwide. The mechanism of host-M.tb interactions remains to be
defined. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are noncoding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides. In response
to bacterial infections, mammalian cells produce abundant lncRNAs to mediate host-pathogen interactions,
which are beneficial or detrimental to host defense. A very limited number of studies have been reported on the
role of host lncRNAs in the response to M.tb infection. However, increasing evidence indicates that host lncRNAs
are engaged in the host defense against microbial infection in host cells. Our long-term goals are to elucidate
the fundamental mechanisms of the host lncRNA-regulated anti-M.tb response in macrophages and investigate
the potential application of host lncRNAs as novel host-directed therapies for tuberculosis. Our preliminary data
indicate that M.tb infection induces the expression of host lncRNA, fetal-lethal noncoding development regulatory
RNA (FENDRR), in mouse and human macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, FENDRR-knockdown
facilitates M.tb growth in mouse and human macrophages in cell culture. Furthermore, FENDRR interacts with
host iron-responsive element-binding protein 1(Irp1) and down-regulates host microRNA miR-214 in mouse
macrophages post M.tb infection. We hypothesize that FENDRR mediates the anti-M.tb response by controlling
intracellular iron availability via interfering with iron-responsive protein IRP1 and by upregulating the anti-M.tb
protein enhancer of Zeste homolog 1 (EZH1) through competing with the host microRNA miR-214. We will test
our hypothesis using mouse and human macrophage cell culture, and mouse models of tuberculosis. Aim I will
investigate the mechanism by which M.tb induces FENDRR expression via the TLR2-Myd88-p38-C/EBPβ axis.
Aim II will define the mechanisms by which FENDRR exerts anti-M.tb response. Aim III will evaluate the
functional roles and mechanisms of action of FENDRR in mouse models of tuberculosis. The proposed studies
will reveal a novel anti-M.tb pathway mediated by host lncRNA FENDRR."

Due to environmental and health concerns, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) previously used as flame
retardants were phased out in the U.S. starting 2004 and substituted with organophosphate (OPFRs) and
replacement brominated flame retardants (RBFRs). Inhalation of contaminated house dust and vapor as a route
of exposure to these chemicals has raised concerns for respiratory health due to their ability to cause irritation,
oxidative stress, bronchoconstriction, endocrine disruption, and epigenetic changes. Yet, the association of these
exposures with respiratory outcomes is unknown, especially in children who may be at higher risk due to higher
exposure to the chemicals. The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that childhood and in utero exposure
to OPFRs and RBFRs is associated with respiratory symptoms and impaired lung function. We will use the
Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study, a multiethnic pregnancy and birth cohort
from the Greater Cincinnati, Ohio, with environmental exposures similar to U.S. national averages. Exposure will
include dust OPFRs and RBFRs measured at child age 1 year and prenatally at 20 weeks of gestation as well
as urine OPFR esters measured annually for the first 3 years and prenatally at 16 and 26 weeks of gestation
and at delivery. Respiratory outcomes will include symptoms assessed biannually until age 5 years and forced
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) measured at ages 4 and 5 years. DNA methylation of cord-blood was
profiled using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. The 3 specific aims to test our hypothesis
will be to determine 1) the association of childhood and in utero exposure to OPFRs and RBFRs with adverse
respiratory outcomes; 2) the association of OPFRs and RBFRs interactions and mixtures with adverse
respiratory outcomes for prenatal and postnatal exposures; and 3) the cord blood DNA methylation changes
related to prenatal OPFRs and RBFRs associated with children’s respiratory outcomes. This innovative project
will be the first prospective study on flame retardants and respiratory health to include RBFRs, prenatal exposure
assessments, and objective measures of lung function. Upon completion, we will have identified the replacement
flame retardants, alone or in mixtures, associated with adverse respiratory outcome. We will have also
determined the exposure cut-offs for increased respiratory risk, the windows of susceptibility, and the DNA
methylation changes mediating the associations."

 Heart failure is characterized by decreased fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and increased glycolysis.
Increasing FAO is beneficial in animal models of heart failure however why it is beneficial is unclear. FAO
inhibition during heart failure occurs in part due to increased hypoxia during ischemia and ischemic
cardiomyopathy now accounts for nearly 70% of heart failure cases. The mechanisms by which hypoxia inhibits
FAO remain poorly understood. FAO is compartmentalized into mitochondria and peroxisomes. I have
discovered that HIFa, the master regulator in the response to hypoxia, depletes peroxisomes. Mechanistically. I
have identified HIFa activates DEPP1, a protein of unknown function that is necessary and sufficient for hypoxia-
induced peroxisome loss. In Aim 1, I propose complementary biochemical and genetic experiments to identify
the mechanism of DEPP1-mediated peroxisome loss. In Aim 2, I will determine how DEPP1 loss reduces
cardiomyocyte death during chronic HIFa activation. In Aim 3, I propose to test the role of DEPP1 in ischemic
cardiomyopathy animal models. These studies will contribute to the understanding of how heart failure inhibits
FAO and identify a novel mechanism in heart failure.
 I am a biologist with a background in metabolism and nutrient sensing, applying for a K99 award with the
long-term goal of becoming a tenure-track, independent laboratory investigator. I envision developing a research
program focused on how the common pathophysiology of limited oxygen availability regulates metabolism at the
cellular, tissue, and organismal level to ultimately harness that knowledge to develop new therapies for ischemic
diseases, such as heart failure and stroke. During my proposed K99 research training, I will perform mentored
research in the lab of Dr. William Kaelin at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), a world’s expert in oxygen
sensing. In the K99 phase of this award, I will focus on identifying the mechanism by which DEPP1 mediates
hypoxia-induced peroxisome loss. As I transition into the R00 phase of this award, I will determine how
maintaining peroxisome function reduces cardiac death during ischemia and test the role of DEPP1 in animal
models of ischemic cardiomyopathy. I have assembled an expert scientific advisory committee to help guide my
development including: Dr. Bruce Spiegelman (DFCI/HMS), Dr. Jean Schaffer (Joslin/HMS), Dr. Christine
Seidman (HMS), and Dr. John Asara (BIDMC/DFCI). I believe that training at DFCI, a world-class clinical and
research environment, along with additional coursework and conferences will help me achieve my long-term
career goals."

For ITM 3.0, we request continued funding for the TL1 Postdoctoral Program, which over the past five years has provided training in clinical research and biomedical informatics to 18 postdoctoral fellows. This current postdoctoral TL1 program was begun in 2017, replacing an earlier predoctoral program; it is comprised of collaborating programs at UChicago and Rush, and its goal has been to prepare postdoctoral trainees for careers as independent and collaborative translational researchers through the integration of clinical research and biomedical informatics training. For ITM 3.0, we will build on the existing program structure and new training opportunities in clinical research, biomedical informatics, and public health to offer interdisciplinary postdoctoral research training that provides fellows with a guiding framework and skillset to help advance health toward health equity through translational research. The new iteration of this program, called the TL1
Postdoctoral Training Program in Clinical Research, Biomedical Informatics, and Health Equity, will incorporate research training opportunities at UChicago, Rush, and Loyola University Chicago to offer didactic training in clinical research, informatics, and public health. In addition, the program will provide faculty-mentored research
opportunities and peer learning opportunities. Postdoctoral training programs such as the TL1 are critical to building a strong, enduring pipeline for developing the next generation of leaders in clinical and translational research who prioritize advancing health toward health equity as a goal of their research. To date, 11% of TL1 postdoctoral trainees have self-identified as a member of an underrepresented minority group. In ITM 3.0, we will redouble our effort to attract trainees who self-identify as under-represented minorities. Trainees will
engage in this postdoctoral program after completing predoctoral training in graduate or medical school, and before a faculty appointment. The purpose of this postdoctoral training is to provide protected time and tuition support for early-career investigators to pursue advanced coursework and engage in mentored research, so
they can successfully compete for faculty jobs, career development awards, and independent research funding."

Dynamic cell-cell interactions are crucial for healthy cell behavior and proper intercellular communication.
Impaired intercellular communication has been implicated in the pathologies of various diseases including
cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, bacterial and viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular
diseases. As a result, probing cell-cell interactions is essential to many areas of biomedical research. It can lead
to a more detailed understanding of various diseases and the development of novel therapeutic strategies, such
as personalized immuno-oncology. However, current single-cell analysis techniques are slow and require
potentially harmful physical contact with cells of interest, hindering the progress in elucidating these phenomena.
Recently, we invented Harmonic Acoustics for Neighboring cell Dynamic studies (HANDs), an acoustic-
based, automated, contact-free, cell-cell-pairing technology, which overcomes the key obstacles associated with
the existing technologies. In this R01 project, we will develop and validate the HANDs platform with the following
features: (1) Contactless nature and high biocompatibility: Instead of requiring direct contact with solid
substrates or beads, the proposed HANDs technology is a contactless method. In addition, rather than exposure
to large shear forces, strong pressures, or powerful optics, which can cause physiological damage, the cells in
our setup are manipulated gently with low-power acoustic waves. The proposed HANDs platform allows long-
term (>24 hours) cell-cell interaction studies. This feat cannot easily be achieved using existing state-of-the-art
technologies such as atomic force spectroscopy. (2) High-throughput reversible cell-cell interactions and
precise quantitative analysis at the single-cell level: The multi-trapping nature of the HANDs technology
enables the simultaneous and parallel study of numerous (>20,000) cell pairs with single-cell precision. Existing
single-cell techniques are either limited to studying a single pair of cells at any given time or lack the precision
needed to control cell pairing and separation, and precise quantitative analysis. (3) Automated operation:
Unlike existing cell pairing technologies which require complicated procedures and tools to achieve operation,
the proposed technology automatically aligns cell-cell pairs using acoustic traps. Additionally, once the control
signal is specified, cells can be brought into contact and separated in whatever automated and prescribed contact
pattern is desired for testing. (4) High resolution (~100 nm): Using single-phase unidirectional transducers and
harmonic frequency modulation, we will improve the spatial resolution of our HANDs technology from ~1 μm to
~100 nm. We will validate the performance of our HANDs platform across two well-established models:
interactions between T cells and cancer cells, and interactions between stem cells and macrophages. In this
regard, we aim to demonstrate the far-reaching potential of HANDs to enable improved research in areas ranging
from fundamental biology to personalized immuno-oncology and drug discovery."

The long-term goal of this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to advance Dr. Shannon
Smith-Bernardin's development as an independent clinician-investigator focusing on novel treatment
paradigms for people with alcohol-use disorders and acute alcohol intoxication. This proposed project has four
training aims: advanced training in: 1) implementation science; 2) obtaining, merging and analyzing
administrative data; 3) qualitative and mixed-methods research; and 4) grant writing. Dr. Smith-
Bernardin has assembled a multi-disciplinary mentorship team including nationally recognized experts in
implementation science, emergency medicine, alcohol use disorders, vulnerable populations, frequent utilizers
of health care, mixed methods, and qualitative research. Alcohol use disorders are associated with significant
morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the United States, emergency departments (EDs) and the ambulance
system (EMS) provide the majority of acute care for alcohol intoxication. Between 2-12% of patients in medical
or psychiatric EDs are acutely intoxicated. “Sobering centers” were designed to address the needs of people
with acute uncomplicated alcohol intoxication who do not require ED care, so that these individuals could
receive safe, high value care in an alternative care setting. If used appropriately, sobering centers can reduce
the need for ED visits and reduce ED overcrowding. In Aim 1, Dr. Smith-Bernardin will characterize and define
the incidence of patients with acute alcohol intoxication in the Sobering Center, the ED, and EMS system and
compare the patient, provider, and environmental-level factors that influence the transport decision using
administrative data. In Aim 2, using the CFIR framework, she will conduct and analyze in-depth interviews to
determine modifiable factors influencing ambulance personnel's decision to transport patients with acute
uncomplicated alcohol intoxication to an ED instead of the Sobering Center. The proposed study is the first to:
1) evaluate paramedic decision making in a community with an established sobering center alternative; and 2)
recruit ambulance, ED, and Sobering Center personnel to examine the factors affecting triage in the field for
uncomplicated alcohol intoxication. Both aims will use innovative implementation science methods to
triangulate health related data from EMS, EDs, and the San Francisco Sobering Center. The training and
research conducted in the proposed project will form the basis of a future R01-proposal hybrid type II trial to
test the implementation and effectiveness of an intervention to reduce provider and environmental level
variation in order to increase of appropriate use of sobering centers and reduce reliance on the ED for acute
alcohol intoxication. The proposed project will provide Dr. Smith-Bernardin the support necessary to become
an independent clinician-scientist using implementation science and mixed-methods research to develop,
evaluate, and disseminate innovative, evidence-based treatment paradigms for individuals with alcohol-use
disorders and acute alcohol intoxication."

The successful administration and management of the National Resource for Translational and Developmental
Proteomics (NRTDP) is a critical component for its continued maturation. Herein we describe the three over-
arching aims that will drive our efforts throughout the lifetime of the Resource.
Specific Aim 1. To develop and support a framework for NRTDP initiatives that is focused on multidisciplinary
biomedical research, technology development, and community engagement.
Specific Aim 2. To support the education and outreach mission of the Resource through continued

Northwestern University (NU), the Consortium for Top-Down Proteomics (CTDP), the National High Magnetic
Field Laboratory (NHMFL) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TFS).
Specific Aim 3. To focus on operations, including Human Resources, relationship management, publications,
compliance and sustainability of the Resource, ensuring continued scientific impact beyond its anticipated
lifetime.
As described, to achieve these aims we will utilize our strong relationship with the administration at NU as well
as its investment and commitment to the Resource. We have assembled a highly qualified, dedicated team that,
under the leadership of the Director, will manage and coordinate the Technology Research and Development
projects, oversee the progress and turnover of Driving Biomedical Projects, and ensure proper access to
NRTDP resources through Community Engagement activities with the overall goal of creating a sustainable
Resource for the scientific community. We describe the development of efficient operating procedures that
ensure integration and reduce barriers to the rapid pace of research."

As life expectancy increases, the burden of seizures in the elderly will increase with up to half of the cases with
no identifiable cause termed Late Onset Unexplained Epilepsy (LOUE). Large databases have identified
patients with LOUE as having a higher risk of dementia and stroke, but studies focusing on individual patients
have been limited. There is a current need to identify the factors underlying LOUE, their impact on cognition
and its natural history to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies.
The first goal of this project is to determine the burden of the two most common aging pathologies in a cohort
of LOUE by assessing the burden of small vessel ischemic disease using MRI and blood biomarkers of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and how they relate to cognition and neurodegeneration. The second goal is to
follow the LOUE cohort over a 3-year period to determine whether the burden of the pathologies increases
when someone has seizures and leads to accelerated cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Through a
junior investigator grant funded by the American Epilepsy Society, I have started recruiting a cohort of 40
subjects with LOUE for cross-sectional analyses. As part of the proposed K23, I will expand this cohort to 100
subjects and follow it longitudinally. A control group will consist of subjects from the Harvard Aging Brian Study,
an NIH funded study following cognitively normal (at enrollment)older adults with clinical assessments, fluid
biomarkers, and multimodal neuroimaging, of which my mentor, Dr. Gad Marshall, has been a co-investigator
since its inception. Findings from this study can be applied to other diseases where seizures are a common
comorbidity such as Alzheimer’s disease.
My training will rely on the mentorship of Dr. Marshall (an expert in AD and aging) and Dr. Page Pennell (an
expert in epilepsy), as well as an advisory committee of world leaders in the fields of AD biomarkers (Dr.
Dennis Selkoe), neuroimaging (Dr. Steven Stufflebeam), neuropsychology (Dr. Rebecca Amariglio), vascular
related cognitive impairment (Dr. Anand Viswanathan), and statistical analysis of longitudinal studies (Dr.
Joseph Locascio). During the training period, I will gain expertise in neuroimaging analysis, the implementation
of longitudinal studies in an elderly cohort, and the statistical analysis of longitudinal data. The institutional
resources available through Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard
Medical School, and Harvard School of Public Health are world class and will support my career development
in an environment that can foster high impact contributions. Upon successful completion of the project, I will be
well positioned to launch a career as an independent investigator examining the interactions of seizures,
neurodegeneration, cerebrovascular disease and cognition."

Stress is a risk factor for the development of addiction, as well as for relapse in abstinent drug users. Over
recent years, it is becoming increasingly clear that dopaminergic circuitry originating in the ventral tegmental
area, which is the most well studied in the context of addiction, is also critical for the behavioral response to
stress suggesting an interaction between stress and addiction. Recent studies have determined that the medial
habenulo-interpeduncular (MHb-IPN) axis is an essential circuit in the pathophysiology of drugs of abuse,
especially nicotine. Specifically, this circuit controls nicotine intake in rodent models, while also mediating the
acute aversive effects of high doses of nicotine. In addition, the IPN has been implicated as an important hub
for anxiety during nicotine withdrawal. Specifically, the stress neuropeptide, CRF is released and activates
CRF1 receptors in the IPN triggering anxiety suggesting that the IPN is a component of the extrahypothalamic
stress network in the brain. However, how the IPN responds to stress in vivo and if/how the IPN may contribute
stress-induced behaviors is unknown. Thus, the goal of this application is to test the hypothesis that the IPN is
a stress-responsive brain area and a critical mediator of stress-induced behaviors that becomes dysregulated
in nicotine-dependence to drive stress effects on nicotine dependence-associated behaviors. In Aim 1, we will
combine GCaMP expression with fiber photometry and optogenetics to test if stress-activation of IPN
GABAergic neurons is critical for stress-induced behaviors. Aim 2 will also combine GCaMP expression with
fiber photometry and test the hypothesis that nicotine dysregulates the response to stress in the IPN to drive
relapse. Finally, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that stressors engage dopaminergic pathways by activating IPN
neurons that project to the lateral dorsal tegmentum. It is anticipated that elucidating circuitry and neuronal
mechanisms underlying stress-induced behaviors in an understudied brain region that is emerging as a critical
node for nicotine dependence should yield great insights into behaviors associated with addiction and set the
foundation for therapeutic strategies for new treatment."
10868839,"In this 2-year R21 grant entitled “Elucidating the three-dimensional organization of the human cerebellar cortex
using histological and ultra-high resolution structural MRI approaches”, we will use advanced 3D histology
and ultrahigh resolution multimodal structural MRI techniques to determine the 3D ground truth organization of
the human cerebellar cortex and relate it to 3D structure in the same tissue samples as shown by high resolution
MRI. The cerebellum is a large brain region appended to the brainstem and consisting of a thin three-layer
cerebellar cortex, and underlying white matter. The cerebellum contains three main divisions, the
vestibulocerebellum, the spinocerebellum and the cerebrocerebellum, each which has distinct afferent and
efferent connections, as well as distinct functions. Moreover, these divisions are often differentially affected by
disease states. There have been limited anatomical studies of the intrinsic connections and three-dimensional
architecture of the human cerebellum and specifically the cerebellar cortex, largely due to methodological
constraints in the human. Most of the information about intrinsic connectivity and cerebellar cortical architecture
is derived from rodent and cat models. Emerging information from animal models have indicated considerable
heterogeneity in the cerebellar cortex of the distinct functional divisions of the cerebellum, but this assumption
has never been explicitly tested in the human cerebellar cortex. Anatomical ground truth information about the
human cerebellar cortex in three dimensions and in the different divisions has not yet been achieved. The goal
of the proposed research is to conduct the first detailed histological analysis of the human cerebellar cortex and
relate the results to structural MRI findings and thereby validate MRI results. To accomplish this goal, we will first
use advanced 3D histological techniques such as CLARITY-based tissue clearing and SWITCH
immunohistochemistry to reveal the neuronal organization of the Purkinje cell layer and granule cell layer as well
as the architecture of the Purkinje cell dendrites and granule cell parallel fiber axons in the molecular layer of the
human cerebellar cortex. This work will be performed in samples from the distinct functional regions of the
cerebellum, namely the vestibulocerebellum, the spinocerebellum, and the cerebrocerebellum to determine
whether the neuronal organization and architecture of the processes in the molecular layer differs across these
regions. Second, and in the identical samples used for histological analysis, we will carry out ultra-high resolution
ex vivo multimodal structural MRI analysis to compare structural and diffusion MRI results to anatomical ground
truth in the human cerebellar cortex. These data will provide a histologically validated MRI dataset of the human
cerebellar cortex using state of the art methodologies from both histology and MRI. The elucidation of this human
intrinsic cerebellar cortical connectome will enable the application of multimodal structural MRI to systematically
characterize the architecture of the human cerebellar cortex and its intrinsic connectivity in healthy and clinical
populations."
10869173,"Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. While
significant advancements have been made in understanding the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis through
animal models and atherosclerotic plaques from non-coronary arterial beds, crucial knowledge gaps still exist
regarding human coronary atherosclerosis and the ability to predict plaque stability. Using a novel approach
designed by our research team, this NIH R01 proposal aims to begin addressing these limitations by analyzing
the transcriptome of human coronary atherosclerotic plaques (HCPs) from patients undergoing percutaneous
coronary interventions and investigating their role in predicting subsequent myocardial infarction and other
major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) following percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI).
In Aim 1, we will determine differences in the composition, molecular functions, and biological processes of
HCP transcriptomes between plaques from patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and stable coronary
artery disease (CAD), as well as between men and women. This aim will involve sequencing the
transcriptomes of HCPs obtained from 2,400 patients undergoing PCI across three centers with diverse racial
and ethnic backgrounds. Additionally, differences between ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and
non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) presentations will be explored.
In Aim 2, we will evaluate the predictive value of HCP transcriptome data for future MACE. This aim involves a
comprehensive follow-up of all subjects for 36 months post-PCI, during which MACE events, including
subsequent ACS, recurrent unplanned revascularization, and death, will be recorded. The transcriptomes of
patients with and without MACE will be compared to identify transcriptome patterns with potential prognostic
implications.
Our exciting preliminary data from a pilot study involving 27 patients demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining
HCP transcriptomes. A solid infrastructure has been established, enabling subject recruitment, sample
collection, and long-term follow-up for over 250 patients to date. The pilot study also highlights significant
differences in gene expression, regulatory pathways, and cell populations between unstable plaques
associated with ACS and stable plaques in patients with stable angina. Importantly, our preliminary data also
suggests there are significant differences in gene expression in coronary plaques in men compared to women
and comparing those who had ACS following their index procedure compared to those who did not.
Successful completion of this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of human coronary
atherosclerosis, elucidate critical biological differences between ACS and non-ACS plaques, and identify
potential therapeutic targets. Furthermore, our findings may establish a first-of-its-kind tool for risk stratification
of MACE post-PCI, enhancing patient care and prognosis prediction."

“Dietary fructose and NASH/HCC progression”
 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is emerging as a leading
risk factor driving the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Dietary fructose is a major risk factor for
NAFLD and subsequent HCC progression. Fructose is primarily metabolized by ketohexokinase (KHK) and KHK-
deficient mice or pharmacologic inhibition is protective against NAFLD but the underlying mechanisms
responsible are largely unexplored. We recently designed studies to investigate whether loss or inhibition of KHK
impacts HIF-α protein stabilization by crossing HIF stabilization reporter (ODD-luc) mice with KHK-/- mice
discovered that intestinal HIF-stabilization (as measured by luciferase activity) is significantly and consistently
reduced by KHK-deficiency. Interestingly, reduced HIF-α stability in KHK-/- mice is fully rescued by the small
molecule inhibitor of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) suggesting that fructose/KHK-dependent HIF-α stabilization
may be mediated by the PKM2 inhibitory metabolite, F1P. Consistent with the reduced HIF-α stabilization
observed in KHK-deficient mice, intestinal expression of the HIF-2α-induced iron transporter, DMT1, is reduced
in KHK-/- mice consistent with our observations that KHK-deficient mice exhibit spontaneous systemic iron
deficiency. Because plasma iron is essential for maximal neutropoiesis coupled with the fact that KHK-deficiency
also results in markedly reduced neutrophil numbers and percentages, our overarching hypothesis is that
fructose facilitates increased intestinal iron absorption via a KHK/F1P/HIF-2α axis, leading to pro-inflammatory
neutropoiesis that, in turn, contributes to the development of HCC. We will test this hypothesis using the following
two specific aims: Aim 1. Determine whether dietary fructose promotes intestinal iron absorption in a KHK, F1P
and HIF-2α-dependent manner. Aim 2. Determine whether dietary fructose promotes systemic inflammation
leading to pro-tumorigenic liver microenvironments due to increased iron-dependent neutropoiesis."

 Over the course of developmental neurogenesis, retinal progenitor cells show progressive changes in
their ability to generate specific cell types, and become progressively more likely to undergo both neurogenic
and terminal divisions. Both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanism control these processes, which are collectively
referred to as temporal patterning. Although the identity and mechanism of action of the gene regulatory
networks that control this process has been largely unknown, we have recently used single-cell RNA-Seq and
ATAC-Seq to identify two separate transcriptional regulatory networks that respectively promote expression of
genes specifically expressed in either early or late-stage retinal progenitor cells, while repressing genes
specific to the other stage. In addition, many of these transcription factors are predicted to directly activate or
inhibit genes that regulate cell cycle progression, Notch signaling and/or neurogenesis. We propose to
determine whether these transcription factors are necessary and sufficient to control temporal profiling in
retinal progenitor cells. We will conduct both gain and loss of function analysis of transcription factors s that
are top candidates for specifying early or late-stage temporal identity, and profile resulting changes in cell
composition, gene expression, and chromatin conformation. We will then investigate the mechanism of action
of transcription factors that show clear phenotypes in further detail, determining how they regulate
developmental competence, proliferation, and neurogenesis. Finally, we will test whether gain or loss of
function of these transcription factors can reprogram neurogenic retinal Muller glia into early-stage retinal
progenitor cells. We anticipate that these studies will both identify molecular mechanisms controlling temporal
patterning in retinal progenitors, as well as new techniques for improving the directed differentiation of early-
born cell types such as retinal ganglion cells and cone photoreceptor receptors, for use in cell-based therapies
for treating blinding diseases."

1,270,000 people worldwide. Severe cases of the disease leads to Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and can be fatal due to pulmonary inflammation and destruction of the
epithelial and endothelial cell lining. Understanding the mechanisms behind these diseases is vital to
develop effective preventive and therapeutic strategies. Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB)-induced
ARDS mimics the cytokine storm, sepsis and multiple organ failure presented in patients with severe
COVID-19. It has been shown that the superantigen structure and sequence associated with the spike
protein of the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of SEB. This SEB-induced ARDS model also results in
various presentations of severity of illness in mice of different genetic backgrounds, as does COVID-
19 in humans. When C3H/HeJ mice are treated with SEB, their survival rate drops to 0%. In our study,
we found that Cannabidiol (CBD) administration following SEB treatment, led to 100% survival
indefinitely. Initial evaluation of whole single cell sequencing data comparing lungs from naïve with
SEB-induced ARDS mice illustrated that there was an increase in neutrophils, inflammatory
macrophages and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) as well as a loss in lung epithelial
cells. To characterize the mechanism by which CBD treatment led to amelioration of the inflammatory
response, microRNA expression analysis was done that showed a significant decrease in expression
of miR-124-3p in SEB-treated group which is directly associated with upregulation of TNF-α and IL-1β
expression as well as macrophage activation gene, Cebp. We hypothesized that CBD attenuates SEB-
induced ARDS by miRNA dysregulation in lung-infiltrating cells, specifically by inducing miR-124-3p
which downregulates Cebp expression resulting in reduced activation of macrophages. Aim 1 will
elucidate the role of resident and monocyte-derived macrophages in disease and the effect CBD on
those subpopulations. Aim 2 will elucidate whether CBD affects Cebp expression and the effects that
miR-124-3p has on manifestation of disease. Aim 3 will determine the epigenetic factors regulating
expression of miR-124-3p. This study will explore CBD as a potential therapeutic for ARDS and/or
sepsis induced not only by SEB but other pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. The K99R00 will provide
opportunities associated with Career Development and training in –omics approaches and biostatistics.
Taken together, my mentors, advisory committee, consultant, and research environment at the
University of South Carolina will nurture my successful transition to an Independent Investigator."
10887654,"Abstract/Project Summary
Secreted proteins serve a variety of critical biological roles and thus, the molecular regulation of protein secretion
is intensively investigated. Many elegant studies have revealed conserved molecular principles underlying the
classical secretory pathway. Proteins bearing signal peptides are co-translationally inserted into the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) where they are properly folded, transported to the Golgi apparatus, and packaged into secretory
vesicles for export to various intracellular destinations or fusion with the plasma membrane to enable protein
secretion into the extracellular space. However, over the past two decades, several cytoplasmic proteins involved
in innate immunity, angiogenesis, and neuronal pathogenicity have been shown to be secreted via ER-Golgi
independent, unconventional secretory routes. Thus, given the broad biological utility of unconventional
cytoplasmic protein secretion (UCPS), understanding the molecular regulation of the process is of considerable
interest. To this end, I developed a genome-scale CRISPR screen to identify novel regulators of UCPS. My
preliminary work has identified a class II phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K-C2α) as a regulator of the secretion
of interleukin-1β, an unconventionally secreted cytokine that plays a major role in the inflammatory response.
Furthermore, I have developed a mass-spectrometry based method that can identify unconventionally secreted
proteins in a high-throughput, unbiased manner. My proposal will apply cutting-edge molecular genetic and
proteomic tools to uncover the breadth of secreted proteins that use UCPS pathways in diverse cell types (Aim
1), and to characterize the role of PI3K-C2α in modulating UCPS (Aim 2). Furthermore, the CRISPR screening
strategy that will be used in Aim 2 may identify novel regulators of UCPS. Together, these studies will address
my central hypothesis that UCPS operates in diverse cell types, and is regulated by a conserved molecular
machinery that supports the secretion of functionally diverse, signal-peptide lacking proteins. This research will
be conducted under the guidance of my primary mentor and mentoring committee, who are experts in the fields
of molecular genetics, protein trafficking, phosphoinositide biology, and proteomics. Their technical, academic,
and professional guidance will allow me to successfully complete the proposed experiments, and help me
transition to independence. As an independent investigator, the long-term goal of my research program will be
to decipher the mechanisms by which the secretory pathway adapts to intrinsic and extrinsic stressors, and
characterize the maladaptive responses that contribute to disease states."

Food allergy affects an estimated 26 million American adults and 5.6 million children. The Consortium for Food
Allergy Research (CoFAR) is a network of clinical research centers who work together to conduct clinical
research to advance understanding of food allergy and the care of food-allergic patients. The University of North
Carolina Food Allergy Initiative (UNCFAI) Clinical Research Center (CRC) is a leader in food allergy research,
clinical care, and education. Under the leadership of Drs. Edwin Kim and Corinne Keet, the UNCFAI CRC will
leverage the well-established infrastructure and resources available at the UNCFAI to conduct high quality
clinical research in food allergy. The specific aims are to: (1) Develop a flexible and collaborative CoFAR Clinical
Research Center to efficiently initiate, enroll, and implement multi-center trials in conjunction with the consortium,
(2) Establish sustainable CRC operations through mentorship, leadership training, and research opportunities
for junior investigators, (3) Propose a network-wide trial building on the strengths of the UNCFAI and the broader
CoFAR network to advance treatment of food-allergic patients and (4) Perform high-yield CRC-specific research
projects that expand UNCFAI research capabilities, provide opportunities for junior investigators, and inform
future CoFAR research. As part of the application, the UNCFAI proposes a multi-center, randomized, placebo-
controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of peanut and cashew multi-food sublingual immunotherapy in
young children. Biosamples from this study will illuminate the local and systemic mechanisms of sublingual
immunotherapy (SLIT). In addition, the UNCFAI will conduct two site specific research projects. Project 1 will
take and analyze biosamples from a recently completed randomized, placebo-controlled trial of peanut SLIT in
young children in order to identify predictors of response to SLIT and explore the mechanisms of desensitization
and remission. Project 2 will create a prospective longitudinal registry of food-allergic patients in order to define
phenotypes of food allergy, attitudes and preferences about food allergy management, and predictors of food-
allergic reactions. These projects will inform future larger studies of food allergy while serving as training
opportunities for junior investigators to ensure that UNCFAI remains a highly productive and sustainable CoFAR
CRC."
10864723,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Large craniofacial bone defect repairs are a frequent surgical procedure, yet limited regenerative options exist
that do not require a secondary surgical site. Clinical outcomes remain difficult to predict, limiting intervention
strategies to improve healing. Newly developed bone-like organoids have the potential to both serve as a
patient specific screening platform for drug dosing and therapeutics, as well as a regenerative alternative for
bone grafting. Additionally, the local and systemic immune response has been implicated as both a biomarker
for successful bone healing in long bone trauma models and a potential therapeutic target to improve bone
regeneration. Yet these strategies have yet to be applied in craniofacial bone, where bone defects can be
exposed to the oral cavity and microbiome, which may further perturb the local and systemic immune
response. The overall objective of this application is to further characterize the bone-like organoid as a model
of bone healing and to determine the local and systemic immune response during bone healing for prediction
of healing outcomes in a clinically relevant craniofacial defect model (mentored phase), then further develop
the bone-like organoid to be both patient specific and have the added complexity of vascular and immune cells
(independent phase). To achieve this goal, an experienced advisory team was assembled including Dr. Robert
Guldberg (primary mentor), Dr. Luiz Bertassoni (co-mentor), Dr. Danielle Benoit, Dr. Niki Moutsopoulos
(collaborators), Dr. Tamara Alliston, and Dr. Paul Krebsbach (consultants). Aim 1 will characterize the
differentiation of the bone-like organoids as compared to native bone healing gene expression. Aim 2 will test
the ability of the organoids to promote repair of OAC defects, characterize the local and systemic immune
response, and create predictive models of bone healing. Aim 3 will develop an adipose derived, patient specific
bone-like organoid model containing vessel fragments and immune cells for drug screening of
immunomodulatory therapies as well as a regenerative strategy. The career development plan details steps to
gain new scientific and professional skills to build a research portfolio in bioengineering, craniofacial sciences,
and osteoimmunology with aspects of commercialization of biotechnologies. Together, these studies will fully
characterize the newly developed bone-like organoid, as well as the local and systemic immune response
during healing of a clinically relevant craniofacial defect model for identification of therapeutics to improve
healing and for creation of patient specific predictive models for healing outcomes. This work will serve as a
foundation for a robust, multi-faceted research program that pushes the boundaries of our understanding of
osteoimmunology in craniofacial bone repair and organoid platforms."
10864724,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In deadly and common familial hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies, structural variation at the single
protein level leads to adverse ventricular remodeling, systolic dysfunction, and diastolic dysfunction. Muscle
contraction is driven by interactions among motor proteins, structural filaments, and regulatory proteins within
sarcomeres. Structural perturbations to the contractile machinery disrupt the kinetics of these interactions and
give rise to systems-level dysfunction in cardiac tissue. This project will investigate the mechanisms of cardiac
contractile dysfunction across multiple biologically relevant spatial and temporal scales using a combined
computational and experimental platform. The proposed work focuses specifically on structural perturbations
that impact the essential interaction between actin and myosin. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that
structural perturbations along a structural communication pathway within the upper and lower 50 kDa domains
of myosin modulate the electrostatic potential and surface area of myosin’s actin binding surface and modulate
the association of myosin heads onto thin filaments. Recent stopped flow kinetics and x-ray diffraction-based
measurements have shown that cardiomyopathy mutations and the small molecule 2’-deoxy-ATP modulate
actomyosin affinity. I have used computational simulations to show that these mutations and small molecules
alter the structure and dynamics of the upper 50 kDa domain of myosin. However, a general description of the
‘rules’ by which mutations and/or small molecules modulate actomyosin interaction requires further study. These
computational predictions also require rigorous testing using in vitro methods. The goals of this work are to
establish a mechanistic framework that explains how structural perturbations to myosin affect its interaction with
actin and to modify actin-myosin interactions with small molecules designed to modulate myosin structure. These
goals will be accomplished by simulating the impact of mutations on myosin structure, myosin
recruitment, and actomyosin interaction (Aim 1), testing computational predictions in single molecules
and contractile organelles from stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (Aim 2), and developing small
molecules designed to modulate actin-myosin interactions by targeting structural communication
pathways in myosin (Aim 3). The project will utilize machine-learning infused computational workflows and
state-of-the-art stem cell technologies to accelerate translational cardiomyopathy research with a combined
computational/experimental platform. The proposed training program will provide me with new skills in stem cell
biology, protein biochemistry, and muscle mechanics that increase the scope of my research. I will be mentored
by a diverse team led by Dr. Michael Regnier, an accomplished researcher in muscle biology who has significant
experience in leading collaborative, multiscale, and interdisciplinary research projects. Research and career
development will leverage resources provided by the Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine and
Center for Translational Muscle Research at the University of Washington."

 One in 10 births results in preterm delivery, and preterm birth is a significant source of childhood
morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization.1 Black families are at highest risk for preterm birth and
adverse child health due to structural racism.2-4 Addressing social drivers/determinants of health (SDH) as
sequela of structural racism as well as predictors of poor health outcomes can improve pediatric health
outcomes.5-7 Several professional organizations recommend addressing social needs in pediatric settings
to reduce racial inequities in health outcomes.8-11 However, there is a lack of evidence to inform
strategies to effectively address SDH to promote the long-term health of Black preterm infants.
 Dr. Karvonen's long-term goal is to become an independent researcher who develops, implements,
and disseminates SDH interventions that improve the long-term health of Black preterm infants. Centering
this population, her overall objectives are to identify the relationships between neighborhood-level SDH,
prematurity, and long-term health; identify family-prioritized SDH and related interventions; and evaluate
the feasibility and acceptability of a novel intervention that addresses SDH. The central hypothesis of her
work is that addressing SDH at birth will improve the positive health and neurodevelopment of Black
preterm infants. The rationale is that understanding the critical components of SDH interventions to impact
long-term health is crucial for developing an effective, scaled, and evidence-based SDH intervention for
this population.
 To pursue her objectives, Dr. Karvonen will pursue these specific aims: (1) To determine associations
between neighborhood-level SDH and long-term health among Black children using extant data from a large,
national, longitudinal cohort; (2) To identify family-prioritized SDH and preferred approaches to interventions
that address SDH using semi-structured interviews; and (3) To determine the feasibility and acceptability of a
novel SDH intervention designed for the general pediatric population among Black preterm infant-caregiver
dyads.
 The proposed work is innovative in its use of (1) a novel outcome, child positive health, in addition to
more traditional health outcomes (2) centering the priorities of Black families with preterm infants, and (3) a
novel intervention that addresses SDH. It is significant as findings will inform a future intervention specifically
designed to address SDH to improve the long-term health of Black children born preterm, a NIMHD priority
population. This work exemplifies the NIMHD priorities to ""enhance the scientific knowledge base and
design interventions to improve health outcomes to reduce and ultimately lead to the elimination of health
disparities"".
 To successfully pursue her proposed specific aims, Dr. Karvonen will receive training in advanced
statistical methodology, qualitative research, and implementation science through didactic courses and
experiential studies at the University of California, San Francisco. She will also be guided by a
multidisciplinary mentorship team of leaders with strong expertise across her training goals."

The education of clinician-scientists is of paramount importance to the field of Otolaryngology. The need for
interfaces between science and medicine, the importance of clinicians that value scientific research, and the
increased importance of evidence-based medicine in health care all argue for research training of
physicians. Moreover, the impact of immunological mechanisms in many ENT diseases has received
increased attention in the past decade, with an increase immune/inflammatory therapeutics in our field.
Immunotherapy has proven to be highly effective in several forms of cancer. Yet Otolaryngology remains
behind many other areas of medicine in immunology research. As an example, the area of innate immunity
mediated by pathogen receptors has seen a dramatic expansion in the broader field of immunology and
infectious diseases over the past 20 years, and the head and neck represent a major pathogen interface.
However, only within the last few years has an increase in innate immune research been seen in our field.
The availability of molecular methods has transformed research in immunology and other areas of
biomedicine, molecular therapies are in active development, and the era of genomic medicine has arrived.
Clinician-scientists well trained in molecular biology are therefore needed. Finally, research into viral
diseases could not be more relevant at the current time. Over the past 30 years, UCSD Otolaryngology has
expanded its immunology, virology and molecular research, resulting in an established cadre of scientists.
These investigators provide a fertile training ground for clinicians who wish to pursue these arenas of
research, to provide ENT with well-trained clinician-scientists. We propose to continue our clinician-scientist
resident research training program under the R25 mechanism. Our program addresses the major barriers to
research by clinicians by providing training in: 1) experimental design and scientific techniques; 2) research
collaboration and teambuilding; 3) grant and scientific manuscript writing; 4) managing the conflict between
clinical work and research; and 5) preparation for academic medicine. The trainees for this program will be
selected from MD's who wish to pursue eighteen months of research training during their Otolaryngology
residency, consisting of the R25 year and additional periods of research training embedded in clinical
training. Trainees from underrepresented groups will be actively sought. Trainees will receive advanced
basic science, translational or clinical research training in the application of advanced immunology, virology
and molecular biology methods to research problems within the NIDCD arena. Research training will extend
throughout residency, to provide continuity and avoid a significant training gap. Trainees will also receive
instruction in research ethics, methods to ensure data quality and reproducibility, responsible conduct of
research, and the preparation of initial review board applications. Finally, we will encourage choice of a
career including research with specific education."
10868430,"Project Summary/Abstract
Binge eating disorder is the most common eating disorder afflicting up to 10% of US adults. It is characterized
by recurring episodes of eating large sums with a sense of loss of control. Preclinical studies have implicated
dysregulation of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in loss of control eating. To provide a deeper understanding as
to how the NAc underlies LOC eating in humans, we leverage data from an early feasibility trial entitled
Responsive Neurostimulation for Loss of Control Eating (NCT03868670). This UH3 study aims to examine the
safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of responsive neurostimulation of the NAc for LOC eating. Two
subjects are currently enrolled and successfully underwent bilateral surgical implantation of the responsive
neurostimulation system (NeuroPace, Inc.) into the NAc. Both subjects are undergoing responsive DBS guided
by NAc delta (2-4Hz) oscillations (i.e. “delta-responsive DBS”) and have exhibited less LOC (primary endpoint).
A supplement to enroll the 4 additional subjects is under FDA review. Here, we intend to characterize the role
of NAc delta signaling in human LOC eating behaviors. Preliminary data suggests that ventral NAc delta power
and bilateral connectivity elevate during anticipatory and LOC-like cravings states, specific to palatable foods.
Futhermore, delta power and ventral bilateral NAc connectivity are reduced following delta-responsive DBS,
and that this effect is sensitive to stimulation parameter optimization. Our central hypothesis suggests the NAc
as a key region in LOC eating, and that aberrant delta signaling underlies LOC eating. As such, we predict that
delta-responsive DBS acts on LOC behaviors through a rescue of the NAc’s aberrant delta signaling. Our aims
are to determine how NAc delta power and connectivity can differentiate LOC eating from normal eating, and
identify neural underpinnings of behavioral response to NAc delta-responsive DBS. As LOC is common to all
binges and is a transdiagnostic feature of many mental health disorders, this work will provide invaluable
insight relevant to much of Psychiatry."

People living in rural areas with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience understudied and
under-addressed challenges. U.S. CKD prevalence is higher in rural areas than urban areas, resulting in a
critical need to study and improve CKD experiences. Rural-residing people with CKD often have complex,
multi-morbid conditions requiring intensive technological treatment and extensive travel to reach care and
services. Location aside, all patients with CKD have difficult-to-manage symptoms and require treatments
associated with hefty self-management. As a result, patients with CKD often struggle with disempowerment.
They ask few questions and struggle to self-advocate. In one study, ≈90% of people with CKD reported
wishing they had more information about their disease; ≈50% expressed they could not ask informed
questions. In advanced CKD (stages 4-5), patients often lack understanding about their disease, making
self-management challenging. Rural-residing individuals with CKD must manage additional logistical
challenges with fewer treatment options, services and supports. There are currently few flexibility-designed
(in-person and telehealth) interventions to improve the self-advocacy of rural-residing patients with CKD. In
other contexts, however, patient-centered communications interventions such as collaborative
agenda-setting have shown promise. Agenda-setting enables clinicians to collaboratively generate and
prioritize discussion topics in clinical visits with patients and care partners. Agenda-setting practice is
associated with improved clinician understanding of patients’ concerns, increased patient satisfaction and –
notably – better adherence to medication regimens. Aim 1 of this training and research program is to
co-adapt an existing generalized visit agenda-setting intervention and co-design an intervention delivery
strategy for rural residents with CKD, their care partners and their clinicians. Using participatory research
methods, we will conduct iterative semi-structured cognitive interviews (n=30) with people experiencing CKD,
their families and their clinicians, revising the agenda-setting intervention based on their feedback. Aim 2 is
to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of using the agenda-setting intervention for patients, care
partners and clinicians. Outcomes include self-advocacy (primary) and utilization (secondary). This will
consist of an open pilot (n=30), followed by a pilot stepped wedge randomized controlled trial (RCT) (n=108).
The goal of the training outlined in this proposal is to produce an independent investigator equipped to
design, trial, and implement interventions, to improve equity for rural-residing Americans with CKD. Training
will cover four domains: 1) rural health equity, 2) CKD serious illness communication,
3) implementation science, and 4) RCTs. The training and experiential learning described will produce an
independent investigator committed to improving experiences for rural-residing people with CKD."
10868761,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Phenomic advances from large-scale electronic health records (EHR) linked to DNA
biobanks have pioneered an efficient approach to genetic discovery that has transformed
human genetic studies, with the enormous potential to provide constraints on relevant biological
mechanisms on a wide spectrum of human phenotypes. Nevertheless, our understanding of the
downstream molecular consequences of genetic associations remains limited and impedes our
ability to develop novel therapeutic strategies for complex diseases. Given their enormous
discovery potential for human genomics and precision medicine, genetic analyses in diverse
populations offer unprecedented opportunities to identify causal genetic mechanisms underlying
human trait variation.
 This research proposal aims to address these convergent developments and critical
gaps and to exert a powerful influence on efforts to expand our understanding of disease
mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Here we hypothesize that a comprehensive multi-
omic, phenomic, and trans-ethnic computational methodology will provide a robust and rigorous
framework. This proposal thus has the following aims:
AIM 1: Develop a regularized regression based methodology and a deep learning framework to
improve characterization of the genetic architecture of gene expression and to build robust
prediction models, extending a Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methodology
(called PrediXcan) that we developed.
AIM 2: Develop statistical causal modeling of trait-associated genetic variation through a
convergent TWAS and Mendelian Randomization approach and apply it to thousands of human
traits with available GWAS and EHR data.
AIM 3: Develop analytic approaches and software tools to further genetic analyses in admixed
and multi-ethnic populations and to lay the groundwork for trans-ethnic multi-omic
methodologies, using EHR data (e.g., BioVU, UK Biobank, All of Us)."
10868762,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Animals exist in complex, sensory rich environments. Certain environmental stimuli (i.e. cues) predict
beneficial outcomes (i.e., rewards) that are crucial for survival. In order to appropriately respond to these
predictive stimuli, we must be able to discriminate these cues from other sensory input and learn the value of
the rewards they predict, during cue-reward learning. Understanding the neural circuits underlying these
processes is critical, as disordered sensory processing is a hallmark of several psychiatric diseases such as
ADHD and substance use disorders. Dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia
nigra pars compacta (SNc) are critical in cue-reward learning, but it is not understood how these regions integrate
sensory information about cues to drive unique aspects of conditioned behavior. The superior colliculus (SC),
which receives input from the retina, has been shown to drive DA neuron activity in response to visual stimuli,
and disrupting the SC can prevent DA activity and conditioned responding to visual cues. The anatomy and
function of SC projections to the VTA/SNc in cue-reward learning is not known.
 To address this gap in knowledge, I will characterize the anatomical and functional connectivity of
the SC to VTA/SNc circuit (Aim 1) and determine the contributions of SC projections during visual cue
learning (Aim 2). To study the topography of this circuit, I will trace distinct pathways from the SC to either the
VTA or SNc and determine the projection targets of the neurons that receive SC input. To determine the
functional connectivity of SC inputs onto the VTA and SNc, I will excite SC projections via optogenetics while
recording the activity of DA neurons in the VTA and SNc through in vivo fiber photometry. These studies will test
the hypothesis that the SC drives DA firing via medial to lateral connections on the VTA and SNc. I will also
measure and manipulate SC projection activity (using fiber photometry and optogenetics, respectively) during a
visual discrimination learning task, to test the hypothesis that SC projections to the DA midbrain augment
conditioned behaviors to predictive cues. These studies will reveal how the SC communicates with the VTA and
SNc, for fundamental insights into the circuit mechanisms of cue-reward learning."

10871695,"Integrating Low-Cost Paper-Based Devices and Personalized
Immunotherapeutics to Treat Triple Negative Breast Cancer
Summary
After a breast cancer patient has an initial appointment with her clinician, one
possible outcome is that the cancer tests positive for one or more clinically
significant cell surface “biomarkers”, most notably estrogen receptor (ER),
progesterone receptor (PR), or HER2. In this relatively good scenario, the patient would likely be prescribed
a personalized therapy such as a hormone therapy (in the case of ER+ and/or PR+ cancers) or with drugs
that specifically target HER2+ cells (e.g. the monoclonal antibody, mAb, Herceptin™). These personalized
drugs are less toxic than general anti- cancer drugs such as chemotherapeutic cocktails.
 In a different, and relatively dire scenario, a patient is told she has “triple negative” breast cancer
(ER-, PR-, HER2-), meaning her cancer cells lack hormone receptors like ER or PR, and lack HER2. Triple
negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents 15-20% of all breast cancer cases, and disproportionately
affects minority populations. Without personalized therapies, this patient is now left to suffer through
treatment with non-targeted and toxic drugs (chemotherapeutics) that come with a host of debilitating side
effects. Commonly, drastic measures, such as mastectomy, are required in order to fully remove all tissue
that could serve as a source of, or substrate for, new tumors. The five-year survival outcomes of populations
that test positive for HR and/or HER2, and TNBC patients substantially differs as well. For patients who
test positive for HR and/or HER2 with regional breast cancer, five-year survival is ~82-89%, but 65% for
TNBC. Clearly, new technologies and approaches are required to target TNBC and provide these patients
the same therapeutic opportunities that patients that test positive for HR or HER2 biomarkers have.
 Here, we propose a fundamentally different approach to personalized medicine, which will
dramatically change how we treat TNBC, particularly in lower income minority populations. We will
evolve small proteins to selectively bind a patient’s breast cancer cells, irrespective of the specific changes
to the cell surface that have occurred as a result of breast cancer. These proteins will be fused to other
proteins that provide stability in the body, and recruit antibodies from the patient’s serum to TNBC cells,
resulting in their targeted destruction. We will pair our TNBC-targeting immunotherapies (drugs that use
the immune system to destroy TNBC cells) with a low-cost paper-based platform, which will allow simple,
accessible, and routine assessment of our TNBC-targeting proteins, and allow clinicians to select which
members should make up a combination therapy. The diagnostic platform will also allow clinicians to
monitor the effectiveness of each member of the cocktail over the course of treatment (as cancer cells
mutate), and select alternative members and/or replacements when necessary.
 Collectively, this work represents necessary and exciting advances in the integration of low-cost
approaches to TNBC-targeting, and personalized, drug discovery, and the optimization and monitoring of
these immunotherapeutic cocktails over the course of treatment."
10871698,"Machine Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Metabolic and Age-related Diseases
Specific Aims
 Age-related and metabolic diseases such as type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),
cardiovascular disease (CVD), obesity, osteoporosis and sarcopenia have become a worldwide
epidemic that affects the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8
million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million do not know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic
diseases, such as diabetes and obesity, are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and
function. Changes in skeletal muscle composition are strongly linked to loss in muscle strength and mass, frequently
termed as sarcopenia, leading to decreased mobility and function. The accumulation of adipose tissue in the human body
and changes of its regional distribution are associated with type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and the metabolic
syndrome.
 Contemporary imaging studies that are performed in vivo on a large number of participants have enabled cross
sectional and longitudinal studies of age-related and metabolic diseases, and effects of pharmacological interventions.
The emergence of advanced imaging technologies has also created the need for automated image analysis techniques for
identification and quantification of morphological patterns of anatomies and tissues and their changes with increasing
age.
 This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human
body composition to achieve timely diagnosis of these pathologies. Our research interests will concentrate on
identification of morphological patterns in the lower extremity that will eventually lead to development of imaging
biomarkers. We will use imaging and clinical data collected by the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) that
is the longest ongoing epidemiology study in the US, as well as publicly available datasets. We will build on recent
advances in medical image analysis to contribute novel and non-invasive techniques for studying the human body
composition and its changes (aim 1). Then we will develop machine learning methods for timely diagnosis and prognosis
of metabolic and age-related diseases (aim 2). We will implement these techniques as open-source software for further
use and development by the research community (aim 3)."
10871701,"Research Capacity Core
Summary
 The primary goal of this core is to create infrastructure to support
investigators in our IHER Center. Over the past decade and a half, DSU has
expanded its faculty in biomedical- and health-related areas and has grown its
research infrastructure. In order to sustain and grow our research enterprise in this
time of hyper-competition for funding, DSU must support its current faculty to develop outstanding
research programs. Quality research infrastructure and access to research resources are absolutely crucial
for developing our institutional research and research training capacity. The Research Capacity Core of our
IHER Center will strengthen DSU’s infrastructure for biomedical, social and behavioral research related to
health disparities and health equity.
 This Core will provide support for qualitative research and program evaluation for DSU
investigators, and will support existing cores in microscopy and cell electrophysiology that provide crucial
resources to biomedical researcher and pilot projects. It will also provide research design, epidemiology
and biostatistics support for health equity researchers, primarily through partnership with the Biostatistics,
Epidemiology, Research Design (BERD) Core of the NIH-funded Delaware Clinical & Translational
Research Center (ACCEL), in which DSU is a partner. The BERD Core provides consultative services in
the areas of epidemiology, biostatistics, research design, data management, and bio- and medical
informatics, and the services vary from assistance analyzing existing datasets to developing collaborative
complex data management strategies and protocols that inform grant or IRB submissions. Consultation and
collaboration emphasize developing engagement with the clinical research community, as well as
community partners.
 The Research Infrastructure Core will also support development of new research resources at DSU
and strengthen what is currently available. First, we will develop a Qualitative Research & Evaluation
Resource to assist behavioral and social researchers at DSU incorporate qualitative methods into their
research to gain a deeper understanding of the “why” and “how” of people’s experiences and perceptions.
It will also support RCMI research and pilot projects with software tools for behavioral and population
research such as GIS, NVivo, Dedoose, ATLAS.ti, SSPS and data security expertise for human subjects
data and to support joining the REDCap consortium. Responsive to the RCMI mechanism our IHER Center
supports basic biomedical research as well as behavioral and social research related to health equity. Our
core will strengthen existing core facilities in bioimaging and cell electrophysiology to enhance the quality
and productivity of biomedical research projects supported by the Center."
10871704,"Investigator Development Core
Summary
 As the racial disparities in infections and deaths due to COVID19 highlight,
health disparities in the US can play a large role in deaths from infectious disease as
well as the chronic conditions that, until the pandemic, were the most urgent causes
of disability and death in the US. Significantly reducing health disparities will require
innovative and effective strategies that increase adoption of health-promoting behaviors among individuals
from under-represented and low SES communities. Investigators in social and behavioral sciences are
increasingly working with health science researchers to produce practical research and interventions that
improve the health of individuals and communities.
 A recommended strategy for reducing health-related inequities is to increase the number of
investigators (including those from underrepresented groups) carrying out ground-breaking research on
both the causes of health disparities and ways to reach health equity. Investigators from socioeconomically
disadvantaged backgrounds and minority groups bring unique perspectives that can enhance understanding
of social and structural causes of health disparities. However, these groups are underrepresented in the
scientific workforce and often lack both the institutional resources and informal support systems to succeed.
 The mission of our Investigator Development Core is to expand DSU’s institutional capacity to
conduct health disparities research by preparing a cadre of health equity investigators conducting
transdisciplinary research projects that can improve health outcomes and reduce disparities, and who are
actively engaged with community members throughout the lifecycle of their research. The IHER Center
will carryout its mission by: 1) Establishing a competitive pilot grant program that will allow new and early
stage investigators at DSU to generate preliminary data to support competitive grant proposals related to
the social and behavioral determinants of health; 2) Fostering the productivity, advancement, and retention
of health equity researchers by providing a robust professional development infrastructure to support
publication of peer-reviewed articles, submission of grant proposals, and development of strong
professional networks; 3) Working with the Community Engagement & Dissemination Core to empower
PIs to engage communities in their research and disseminate health research-related information; and 4)
Providing a robust, interactive educational program to enhance knowledge and awareness of minority health
and health equity across the DSU community.
 The core will leverage the R01 and R15 grant experience of ID Core director with the experience
of the RCMI PIs in leading research centers focused on supporting early stage investigators to establish
successful research programs and win external funding."
10871706,"Community Engagement and Dissemination (CED) Core
Summary
 There is a persistent and troubling gap between the knowledge generated by
health science research and its dissemination, translation and eventual uptake and use
by relevant stakeholders, including community members and professionals that
provide services to target communities. Closing this gap will be vital to reducing the
inequities in health and healthcare that unnecessarily shorten lives and reduce life quality in affected groups.
Historically-Black institutions (HBCUs) such as DSU, with their diverse faculty and student bodies,
importance in preparing African-Americans for careers in the health professions, and close ties to minority
communities can play a key role in the translation of research findings into sustainable community and
systems-level changes, which will mitigate, and ultimately prevent health inequities. Key to this translation
process is engagement with communities and effective dissemination of research findings, and involvement
of stakeholders, throughout the research lifecycle. The Community Engagement and Dissemination core of
the Interdisciplinary Health Equity Research Center (IHER) will facilitate collaborative relationships with
a wide array of Delaware-based stakeholders, allied in the shared goal of advancing the science of health
disparities, through a range of community-informed and community-engaged dissemination activities.
 Our overall goal for the CED Core is to embed a Community First in All Research (CFiAR)
approach as a norm across the IHER Center to make research more impactful and responsive to community
needs and priorities. The CED core of our Center will be focused on: 1) Developing a Kent-Sussex County
Community Consultation Council and a network of community partners for research and dissemination; 2)
Working with our community partners to conduct a community level assessment of the needs of
underrepresented populations in Kent and Sussex Counties, as well as the existing resources, and services
that address those needs; 3) In collaboration with our community partners, develop dissemination strategies
and products, that will engage community members in health and health disparities research and science
activities. This will include developing a Dissemination Awards program for DSU and community-based
partners to facilitate contextually relevant dissemination activities and products to connect research findings
to target audiences and end users; 4) Facilitate, coordinate, and evaluate community engagement and
dissemination activities across all components of the IHER Center.
 By implementing these activities, we expect to contribute to the overall goal of IHER of advancing
the science of reducing health inequalities by translating research findings into sustainable community and
systems-wide changes."
10868004,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) is a strictly human disease caused by louse-borne Borrelia recurrentis. To
date, LBRF has been a significant burden in several African nations. LBRF may account for up to 27% of hospital
admissions. The mortality can be as high as 40%, if left untreated, and low as 1-5% when treated with
antimicrobials. LBRF is characterized by fever relapses associated with spirochetemia, which are driven by the
antigenic variation system made of vsp and vlp (pseudogenes)genes, allowing spirochetes to evade antibodies.
To date, the vsp/vlp system of B. recurrentis remains uncharacterized (knowledge gap), which is in contrast to
the well-defined vsp/vlp system of Borrelia hermsii. LBRF research has been hampered by the lack of
immunocompetent animal model. Recently, by using the Collaborative Cross (CC) resource, we developed an
immunocompetent mouse model. For that, A17 strain was used and the infected mice consistently developed
an increasing level of spirochetemia during day 1-3 pi. However, the mice did not develop any detectable
spirochetemic relapse(s). Our recent unpublished data demonstrated that, unlike strain A11, B. recurrentis strain
A1 developed multiple relapses over a 20-day period in CC046 mice. By whole genome sequencing A1 via
PacBio, we were able to define the antigenic variation system of B. recurrentis A1. Based on the presence (or
absence) of promoter sequences, a total of 29 vsp/vls pseudogenes, 23 silent vsp/vlp genes, and 6 putative
active vsp/vlp genes were identified. The 6 putative active expression genes were separately located on different
linear plasmids (lp190, lp55, lp42, lp35, and lp23) and the chromosome, and were adjacent to telomeres. Given
that in B. hermsii, there is only a single vsp/vlp expression gene, which is located on a single plasmid and
adjacent to the telomere, it is hypothesized that one of the 6 putative active vsp/vlp genes identified in B.
recurrentis strain A1 is the vlp/vsp expression site. To test this hypothesis, the following Specific Aim will be
pursued:
Specific Aim: Deletion one of the six putative active vsp/vlp genes will disable the antigenic variation
system of B. recurrentis strain A1.
To test the hypothesis, we will produce 6 A1 vsp/vlp knockout mutants by deleting one of the six putative active
vsp/vlp genes in each knockout; and the respective six in cis complements. All mutants will then be tested in
CC046 mice for their capacity to establish spirochetemic relapses. The novelty of this application is multifold and
includes the use of novel mouse model and PacBio data, and proposed application of targeted deletion to
generate B. recurrentis mutants. The expected data will provide the insight into the vsp/vlp system of B.
recurrentis, the knowledge, which could ultimately be utilized for developing therapeutic measures against LBRF."

For multiple cancer types, epidemiological data exhibit strong correlations between, on the one
hand, the incidence of the disease, its severity when diagnosed, and its clinical outcome, and, on
the other hand, the ancestral background of the patient. This well-documented phenomenon
strongly suggests a link between the biology and genetics of cancer in an individual and the
individual's genetic ancestry. Indeed, recent research in cancer genomics, both pan-cancer and
cancer type-specific, points to genetic and phenotypic differences between tumors occurring in
patient populations with differing genetic ancestries, and to the need for more data collection to
power further study in this area. It is the purpose of this proposal to facilitate such data analysis
on a much greater scale, by enabling genetic ancestry inference directly from cancer-derived
molecular data, without the need for the patient's cancer-free genotype or self-declared race or
ethnicity. Successful completion of this project will unlock vast amounts of such data for ancestry-
oriented studies of cancer from two major sources. One is the body of data stored by the
Sequence Read Archive and similar massive digital repositories, on the order of 106 cancer-
derived molecular profiles. The other is the body of archival tumor tissues across multiple medical
centers, from millions of which molecular data may be generated.
 We will develop software tools for genetic ancestry inference from multiple types of
cancer-derived data, namely, DNA sequence data from whole exomes, whole genomes at low
coverage and targeted sequence panels; RNA sequence data; ATAC-seq and bisulfite-converted
sequence data. The tools to be developed will deliver inference of global genetic ancestry at a
sub-continental level of resolution, of ancestral admixtures and of local ancestry. These tools will
be adaptive, endowed with the ability to optimize their performance for each input cancer-derived
molecular profile. This adaptability will be achieved using simulated data, combining the input
cancer-derived profile with ancestral backgrounds representing well-defined population groups.
As a result, these inference methods will perform consistently, and with quantifiable accuracy,
across a range of profiling depths and qualities, and mitigate cancer-related damage to the
genome. An open-source, user-friendly and FAIR-compliant software implementation of these
methods will be made available to the research community through a number of channels,
including GitHub, Bioconductor and Galaxy. Training and community outreach for this software
will be provided in collaboration with ITCR Training Network."
10873335,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Healthcare workers on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic are experiencing unprecedented levels
of stress and trauma exposure, resulting in exceptionally high rates (27-57%) of posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD). Although Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) have expanded their offerings to support healthcare
workers during the pandemic, they lack the capacity to provide time-intensive first-line treatments for PTSD. To
address this problem, the study team has adapted a standard first-line 12-session treatment into a brief, 4-6
session format (Prolonged Exposure for Primary Care; PE-PC) and demonstrated its efficacy in military service
members. Given the rising tide of PTSD in frontline healthcare workers, there is an urgent need to test the
effectiveness and subsequently implement PE-PC for this population by leveraging the existing resource of the
healthcare system EAP. The long-term goal is to address COVID-19-related PTSD symptoms among
healthcare workers and other vulnerable populations. The overall objective of this application is to demonstrate
the effectiveness and identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of PE-PC in healthcare system
EAPs. The central hypothesis is that PE-PC will reduce COVID-19-related PTSD symptoms and improve
functioning, compared to EAP Treatment as Usual (TAU). The rationale is that effectively treating COVID-19-
related PTSD in the EAP setting is a scalable and cost-effective way to reduce healthcare worker distress and
disability and will accrue downstream benefits to the healthcare organization and its patients. To accomplish
the objective, this project will test the effectiveness of PE-PC, delivered by EAP counselors via telehealth,
versus EAP TAU in 360 healthcare workers with PTSD at four southeast Michigan healthcare systems. This
Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial will test the effectiveness of PE-PC and gather data regarding
implementation through process evaluation and implementation mapping. The specific aims are: Specific Aim
1: Compare the effectiveness of PE-PC versus EAP TAU in reducing PTSD symptoms at 6-week (post-
treatment), 3-, and 6-month follow-ups. Specific Aim 2: Compare the effectiveness of PE-PC versus EAP TAU
in reducing burnout and improving job performance and functioning at 6-week, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups.
Exploratory Aim 1: Confirm the mechanism and identify key mediators/moderators. Exploratory Aim 2: Conduct
cost-effectiveness analysis. Exploratory Aim 3: Prepare for future implementation by conducting process
evaluation and implementation mapping. This strategy will yield an implementation strategy that is targeted to
address EAP-specific implementation barriers. This project is significant because it will contribute to the field a
point-of-care intervention for frontline HCWs with COVID-19 related PTSD, thus improving clinical practice for
this vulnerable population and increasing preparedness for future public health emergencies. This proposal is
innovative because it will it will shift delivery of efficacious PTSD treatment from lengthy care in a traditional
specialty care setting to brief treatment with a telehealth option in a frontline community setting."

Significance: Bone metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) is currently an incurable disease. While standard of
care treatments (androgen deprivation therapy-ADT, chemotherapy) are initially effective, this heterogeneous
disease often evolves to become resistant, thus representing a major clinical challenge. Our group also
demonstrates that the bone ecosystem contributes to the emergence of resistant mPCa but how the
ecosystem in turn, impacts the efficacy of standard of care treatment represents a major gap in our knowledge.
Biology driven mathematical models offer a novel and effective means with which to address these complex
issues since cancer evolution and bone ecosystem responses to applied therapies can be rapidly tested,
optimized for efficacy to delay the onset of resistant disease, and subsequently, validated experimentally.
Rationale: Using empirical data, we will generate an agent-based mathematical model to describe the
interactions of heterogeneous mPCa cells with the surrounding bone microenvironment. In silico, we will test
the effect of standard of care treatments ADT (Lupron) and chemotherapy (docetaxel) on the growth of cancer
over time. The model can identify the impact of these treatments on mPCa cells but also the role of other bone
cell types such as, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in disease progression. Based on this rationale, we
hypothesize that experimentally powered HCAs can be used to dissect the bone ecosystem effects on mPCa
evolution and optimize treatment strategies so as to prevent the emergence of resistant disease. To test this
hypothesis, we propose three interdisciplinary aims.
Approaches: In Aim 1, human prostate cancer cell line (VCaP and LAPC4) growth parameters will power a
hybrid cellular automaton (HCA) agent-based mathematical model of heterogeneous mPCa in bone. The
response of the model to standard of care therapy (ADT and or docetaxel) will be studied and results validated
in vivo. In Aim 2, we will explore the role of the bone ecosystem, specifically MSCs, in controlling the
emergence of resistance to standard of care treatments. Human data will be used to assess the clinical
applicability of the eco-evolutionary HCA. In Aim 3, evolutionary algorithms (EA) will be used to guide the
adaptive application of standard of care therapy.
Innovation/Impact: Our innovative studies will; 1) generate a robust mathematical eco-evolutionary model of
bone mPCa that can be used to dissect the role of the bone microenvironment in the emergence of resistance,
2) identify the effects of standard of care therapies on heterogeneous cancer cells and the bone ecosystem
and, 3) allow for the rapid determination of optimized adaptive therapies that take into account the
contributions of the bone ecosystem. We believe the proposed studies will significantly impact the way
treatments are applied to men diagnosed with bone mPCa and ultimately improve their overall survival."

The proposed research education program, Navigating Educational Trajectories in Neuroscience (NET Neuro),
is an innovative cohort-model designed to accelerate pre- and postdoctoral trainees’ success by fostering
community among peers and faculty at critical transition periods in their education and as they define and
navigate their professional and academic goals. Grounded in a framework of responsive, individualized
mentorship and community-building, NET Neuro aims to build critical skills and leadership capacity through
collaborative mentoring experiences, formal and informal mentorship training, and new Graduate Education
Modules to build skills needed by the changing neuroscience workforce. By integrating well-established
institutional research training programs with new evidence-informed practices and curriculum offerings, we offer
new resources to support graduate students and postdocs from underrepresented and disadvantaged
backgrounds at key transitions along their training pathway, and thereby facilitate their professional and
leadership development and prevent the loss of talent at each level of educational advancement.
Building on the University of Oregon’s strength in interdisciplinary neuroscience research and training, NET
Neuro will annually enroll 7 graduate students and 3 postdocs to participate in a 2-year training program, with
the opportunity for continued engagement as program alumni. Graduate students will be recruited at the end of
their first year of study, given the clear need to support students as they transition from intense rotation
experiences or completion of Master’s theses to the relatively unstructured task of refining their independent
research. Postdoctoral scholars will be targeted for participation in their final two years of training, when there is
a significant need for mentorship and professional skill building as they prepare to enter the job market. The
program focuses on two specific aims: 1) to establish mentoring communities and train the next generation of
neuroscience researchers in culturally-aware mentoring practices, and 2) to develop and integrate curriculum to
enhance skill development and prepare trainees for successful educational transitions and long-term career
trajectories. Evidence-based practices in mentoring, including the creation of mentor networks, opportunities for
“mentored mentoring” experiences, and formal mentorship training will offer individualized support to trainees
from underrepresented backgrounds and foster an inclusive training climate. Core knowledge development
through a series of courses on grant writing, coding data science, rigor and reproducibility, and professional
development will build critical skills and prepare trainees for successful transitions to the next stage of their
educational and career pathways. By fostering a productive climate of mentorship and advancing core skills,
NET Neuro will contribute to the diversification of the region and nation’s research workforce in neuroscience
and facilitate the future success of the next generation of neuroscience scholars."

Health inequalities in chronic pain exists in the US, with a greater burden of chronic pain and higher rate of
misdiagnosis and undertreatment reported in minoritized groups compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Asian
Americans (AA) are the fastest-growing racial/ethnic group in the US, yet despite the rapid growth in their
numbers, AA remain under-represented in pain disparity research. People from culturally and linguistically
diverse communities are known to have higher levels of pain, disability, and psychological distress when they
live in a Western environment. AA are linguistically diverse and among the racial groups most likely to be
limited in English proficiency, which may contribute to their linguistic and social isolation. Underdiagnosis and
underreporting of pain among AA have been reported. Cultural norms of Asians may discourage reporting their
pain to avoid burdening others or being seen as weak. Rather than seeking medical assistance, Asians have
been reported to tend to accept the pain as natural or to suffer to maintain their independence. Our preliminary
studies found that Korean Americans (KA) exhibited higher levels of pain severity and pain catastrophizing
compared to their counterparts living in Korea. However, very few evidence-based programs are available that
can be implemented for this linguistically/socially isolated population in the US. This proposed study aims to fill
critical knowledge gaps in pain disparity research by providing evidence of feasibility and acceptability of a
culturally-tailored psychosocial pain education intervention for an underrepresented population using the KA
community as an exemplar. Using a sequential exploratory mixed-method design incorporating a Community-
Based Participatory Research approach, we will: (1) iteratively adapt and culturally-integrate a previously
established psychosocial education intervention for KA to develop an effective program to improve pain
outcomes for underserved KAs with chronic pain in the community; conduct KA Community Advisory Board
meetings and participant focus group interviews to improve the intervention design, content, and cultural
relevance, and (2) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the culturally adapted psychosocial education
intervention using a single group, pre-posttest design with 30 foreign-born Korean immigrants with chronic pain
dwelling in the community. We will conduct a survey to assess improvements in the outcomes (i.e., pain
catastrophizing, pain intensity/interference) at 3 time points (pre-test, post-test, 12 weeks after the
intervention). Post-intervention in-depth interviews will be conducted with subset of the participants (n = 10) on
their reflections about the program. Feasibility and acceptability will be evaluated by integrating quantitative
(i.e., recruitment/retention rate, participants engagement) and qualitative (i.e., perceived appropriateness)
findings. Achievement of study goals will demonstrate for the first time that a nurse-led, community-based
psychosocial education intervention to reduce chronic pain for the underrepresented KA population may be
feasible and acceptable, forming the basis for a larger efficacy trial to test the tailored intervention."

 Oxidative substrate functionalization provides the opportunity to introduce new chemical functionality and
structural complexity. Synthetic electrocatalysis provides a conceptual platform for sustainable oxidation
technologies by obviating the need for stoichiometric chemical oxidants, and the attendant waste implied by
these reagents. In practice, slow interfacial electron transfer chemistry of many organic molecules prevents
widespread application of electrochemical methods to fine-chemical synthesis. Further, single electron-transfer
processes, which are the currency of electrochemical strategies, are not common elementary steps in
synthetically important transformations. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that development of
hypervalent iodine electrocatalysis will provide a platform to achieve a broad array of oxidative substrate
functionalization electrochemically. This hypothesis is predicated on the rich chemistry of hypervalent iodine
reagents, which are well-known to participate in selective two-electron oxygenation, amination, halogenation,
and hydrocarbyl transfer reactions. Successful development of hypervalent iodine electrocatalysis would
substantially impact the synthesis of fine chemicals, such as molecular therapeutics.
 This proposal aims to first develop electrocatalysis via electrochemically generated hypervalent iodine
species. Specifically, the proposed strategy leverages a previously unappreciated strategy for the synthesis of
hypervalent iodine species – that one-electron pathways provide efficient access to selective two-electron
chemical oxidants based on hypervalent iodine compounds – to develop synthetic hypervalent iodine
electrocatalysis. Preliminary data indicate that electrochemically generated carboxy radicals enable facile
electrosynthesis of hypervalent iodine species and that electrochemically generated hypervalent iodine species
are competent mediators of oxidative C–H / N–H coupling. We propose to extend these preliminary results to
develop new synthetically useful transformations, such as oxidative C–H functionalization. Further, the
fundamental understanding of the elementary steps involved in the oxidation of aryl iodides provides the
chemical insight necessary to develop novel methods of hypervalent iodine synthesis that will substantially
expand the synthetic scope of hypervalent iodine catalyzed substrate oxidation. A long-term goal of these
efforts is to identify new catalyst scaffolds to enable catalyst-controlled site- and stereoselective C–H
functionalization which would provide direct access to complex molecular architectures functionalized at
positions of metabolic consequence, which would impact the evaluation of drug metabolites and impact the
discovery of new therapeutics. Together, the proposed research efforts will provide both new sustainable
synthetic methods and expand the synthetic toolbox of transformations that are available for the synthesis of
functional molecules.

10881794,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrine disorder in young women, is characterized by 
hyperandrogenemia and metabolic dysfunction. PCOS women who become pregnant may have offspring born 
with low birth weight (LBW), associated with increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) later in life. 
However, there are few studies on long-term consequences of PCOS pregnancy on the CV health in adult 
offspring, and most importantly, there is no information on sex differences in CVD in adult PCOS offspring. We 
use a well-characterized and clinically-relevant model of PCOS, the hyperandrogenemic female (HAF) rat. As in 
human PCOS offspring, both male and female offspring of HAF dams (F1HAF) are born with LBW. My preliminary 
data show that by 16 wks of age (adults), male F1HAF have decreased testosterone (T), increased intrarenal 
angiotensin (Ang) II and Ang converting enzyme (ACE), indicating activation of the intrarenal classical 
vasoconstrictor renin angiotensin system (RAS), an increase in inflammatory cytokines consistent with a 
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), proteinuria, and an enhanced pressor response to Ang II 
infusion. A senolytic cocktail (dasatinib and quercetin) in male F1HAF decreases proteinuria and BP. In contrast, 
my preliminary data show that female F1HAF have no change in T levels, no activation of the vasoconstrictor RAS 
(similar intrarenal ACE and Ang II, lower Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) expression) compared to controls, but 
they have increased ACE2 expression, suggesting activation of the intrarenal non-classical vasodilator RAS. In 
addition, female F1HAF are normotensive with no proteinuria, and they have an increase in anti-inflammatory 
renal regulatory T cells (Tregs) and a decrease in pro-inflammatory T helper 17 cells (TH17). Their BP is also 
refractory to infused Ang II, suggesting that female F1HAF are protected against programmed CV risk in adulthood. 
In the proposed studies I will test the following hypotheses: 1) Adult male F1HAF develop an activation of the 
intrarenal vasoconstrictor RAS that contributes to a decrease in renal Tregs, which promotes the 
development of inflammatory SASP causing renal injury and enhanced pressor response to Ang II; 2) 
Adult female F1HAF develop an activation of the intrarenal vasodilator RAS and upregulation of renal 
Tregs, thus protecting from renal injury and the pressor response to Ang II, in the following specific aims: 
Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that adult male F1HAF have an activation of the intrarenal vasoconstrictor RAS 
(increased renal cortical ACE, Ang II, and AT1R), that causes a decrease in renal Tregs which promotes the

function along with an enhanced pressor response to Ang II. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that adult female 
F1HAF have an activation of the intrarenal vasodilator RAS (increased renal cortical ACE2, AT2R and Mas R) and 
an increase in renal Tregs, which in turn causes them to be protected from renal injury and refractory to the Ang

10881795,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that affects 7-10% of women in their reproductive years, 
accounting for roughly 5 million women in the United States. Approximately, 80% of PCOS women suffer from 
hyperandrogenemia increasing the risk for developing comorbidities, such as obesity, chronic inflammation, 
increased blood pressure, type II diabetes, insulin resistance, dyslipidemias, and hyperleptinemia. In addition, 
approximately 42% of PCOS women suffer from gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as abdominal pain, 
constipation, diarrhea, and/or bloating. Many of these symptoms are associated with sub-acute GI inflammation. 
Metformin, a common treatment for metabolic dysfunction in PCOS women, causes GI side effects, often 
resulting in patient non-compliance with treatment. However, the mechanisms that contribute to these GI 
symptoms are unknown. My exciting preliminary data in the hyperandrogenemic female (HAF) rat model of 
PCOS show mitochondrial dysfunction, increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), and 
inflammation in the colon. Furthermore, my preliminary data show that colonic mtROS and inflammation are 
further increased in HAF rats given metformin. We hypothesize then: 1) the development of sub-acute GI 
inflammation in PCOS women is due to androgen- and AR-mediated impairment of colonic mitochondrial 
oxidative phosphorylation, leading to increased mtROS, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation that is further 
exacerbated by metformin; 2) the use of a mitochondrial targeted antioxidant therapy, such as MitoTEMPO, will 
improve mitochondrial function, decrease mtROS and inflammation, thus preventing development of sub-acute 
GI inflammation in PCOS women. These hypotheses will be tested our well characterized and clinically relevant 
model of PCOS, the HAF rat, in the following specific aims: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that colon mitochondrial 
dysfunction and increased mtROS in HAF rats is linked to increased gut dysbiosis and sub-acute GI 
inflammation, and that mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant therapies, such as MitoTEMPO, will attenuate these 
changes; Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that metformin in the HAF rat exacerbates colonic mitochondrial 
dysfunction increasing gut dysbiosis and inflammation, and that addition of an antioxidant, such as MitoTEMPO, 
will improve the mitochondrial function with metformin."

Sex differences in glioblastoma (GBM) incidence and survival are well documented but the underlying
mechanisms are not well understood, resulting in lack of clinical guidance for therapeutic strategies. The
proposed mechanisms for these sex differences include cell intrinsic and systemic factors. Iron is uniquely
positioned as a critical cell intrinsic factor whose systemic levels impact tumor burden and whose bioavailability
is influenced by sex. Iron is required for the regulation of metabolism, gene expression, macrophage/microglial
function, and global immune status. Due to the critical importance of iron in biological systems, there are multiple
homeostatic cell and molecular pathways that must be coordinated, which include complementary
communication among different cell types in the tumor microenvironment. This complex biological regulatory
system is collectively defined as the tumor iron signature. We observed that expression of the iron homeostatic
regulator gene (HFE), which is a key regulator of iron uptake by all cells, predicts prognosis in female but not
male GBM patients. In addition, extrinsic factors such as circulating levels of ferritin in the cerebrospinal fluid are
associated with poor outcomes in GBM, likely related to our new finding that H-ferritin binds to cells in the GBM
as part of a sex-specific GBM iron signature. While the iron status influences gliomagenesis, iron homeostatic
pathways have specific sex-based challenges, such as higher incidence of anemia in women, that are under-
appreciated in the context of cancer and the focus of this project. Based on published data in multiple cancers
and our published and preliminary data, we hypothesize that sex differences in the regulation of both host
and cellular iron status will impact cell-intrinsic metabolism, gene expression, cell:microenvironment
interactions and gliomagenesis. The objective of this proposal is to characterize the iron signature of GBM in
humans and then to leverage these data to interrogate mouse and cell culture models to identify the mechanisms
by which the iron signature in the GBM is established and modified by cell intrinsic and environmental factors.
We will test our hypothesis through two specific aims: Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that sex-specific
complementary iron regulation signatures are present in tumor cells and the GBM microenvironment;
Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the iron signature of GBM displays sexual dimorphism and
drives tumor growth through integration of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic iron-mediated interactions.
These studies complement the other P01 projects on genetic/epigenetic features (Project 1) and tumor
microenvironment associated inflammation states (Project 3) by bridging cell intrinsic versus cell extrinsic
tumorigenic programs through a common mechanism, iron metabolism."

Viral evolution enables the emergence of novel viral pathogens in the human population. The evolution of
influenza A virus is also critical for the maintenance of seasonal lineages in the context of host immunity.
Evolution can result from selection, leading to increased fitness, or stochastic processes that typically decrease
fitness. The relative potency of selective and stochastic forces is therefore a critical determinant of the adaptive
potential of a population. Based on evolutionary theory, we hypothesize that the magnitude of stochastic effects
in viral evolution is strongly impacted by the spatial structure that characterizes viral spread within a host. In
other words, the expansion of a virus population in space may give rise to random, within-host bottlenecks and
founder effects that weaken the efficiency of natural selection. Factors that shape viral spread - including viral
phenotypes, host responses and physical characteristics of the host environment - are therefore predicted to
impact viral genetic diversity and evolution. Our overarching hypothesis is that viral features that modulate
viral spatial structure also modulate viral diversity and evolution. We will test this hypothesis for influenza
A virus using a well-integrated combination of simulation modeling and experimental approaches. In Aim 1, we
will use computational, cell culture and ferret models to examine the consequences of spatially structured spread
for genetic diversity of viral populations. For our experiments, we will use viruses carrying a selectively neutral
barcode to allow robust quantification of viral diversity. In this way, the degree to which stochastic effects
dominate viral dynamics will be examined under a range of conditions. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the
consequences of spatially structured spread for both purifying and positive selection. Computational approaches
will be used to develop hypotheses of how long distance virus dispersal impacts the ability of de novo beneficial
and deleterious mutations to reach dominance. These model predictions will then be tested using experimental
evolution under conditions of common vs. rare long distance dispersal. In this way, we will test the theoretical
concept that stochastic effects associated with spatial structure impede the ability of natural selection to act on
expanding populations. Taken together, the research proposed in these two aims will uncover the importance of
spatial structure to viral population biology and evolution, deepening our fundamental understanding of the forces
shaping viral evolution in nature."

Objective: Respiratory viral infections affect millions of individuals each year. Conducting frequent
widespread viral screening tests can curb outbreaks by quickly identifying infectious persons. Unfortunately, no
screening diagnostic platform exists with the capacity to test hundreds of millions of people daily during a
pandemic. This proposal is the first step in developing a novel viral screening test to fill this gap. The assay will
consist of microscopic circuits containing field effect transistors with antigen-specific receptors that are sensitive
to particular viruses. These chiplets – barely visible to the human eye – will be powered by light and will transmit
data using a light emitting diode, such that a few can be mixed into an extracted sample and illuminated with a
handheld device to yield immediate results. This diagnostic will be scalable and inexpensive; millions of tiny
chiplets can be fabricated simultaneously. It will be minimally instrumented; an ordinary cellphone with a strobe
flash and camera will interface with the chips. It will be flexible, rapidly adaptable, and multiplexable; receptors
specific to different or emerging viruses could be immobilized on distinct circuits, allowing multiple diseases to
be detected simultaneously in a single patient sample. This diagnostic will thus be unmatched as a mass
producible, simple to use, adaptable, and high throughput tool for frequent and widespread virus screening.
Specific aims: The proposed diagnostic will be developed by pursuing the following specific aims.
1. Integrate biological field effect transistors into the existing optical wireless integrated circuit platform.
2. Develop a multiplexed detection scheme for interacting with optical wireless integrated circuits.
3. Demonstrate the test’s feasibility in a clinically relevant quantitative range using mock clinical specimens.
Career development plan and career goals: Dr. Matthew Campbell (Ph.D., P.E.) is a postdoctoral
researcher in the School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Pennsylvania, where his work
is focused on fabricating microelectromechanical systems. The proposed K25 career development award will
apply his nanofabrication skills toward biosensor development and extend his training and exposure into two
new domains: (1) biomedical experimentation, and (2) medical biology. This proposal contains a cohesive
mentorship and didactic strategy centered on these areas to accelerate his trajectory toward research
independence. Completion of this multifaceted training plan will position Dr. Campbell with the cross-disciplinary
skills and expertise necessary to become a leading investigator in the field of biomedical sensing diagnostics.
Mentors and environment: Dr. Campbell is enthusiastically supported by the university and his strong
mentoring team. His primary mentor is an expert in micromanufacturing (Prof. Igor Bargatin (Ph.D.)), and his co-
mentors bring extensive experience in microscopic circuits (Prof. Marc Miskin (Ph.D.)), field effect transistor
sensors (Prof. Charlie Johnson (Ph.D.) and Prof. Haim Bau (Ph.D.)), and viral respiratory tract infections (Prof.
Ronald Collman (M.D.). This group will provide the ideal training situation for Dr. Campbell to develop this assay."

Interferon (IFN) and IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) are a critical component of innate immune responses that help
in the early control of viral infections. Transcriptional upregulation of IFN and ISGs is tightly controlled through
negative regulators under basal conditions to maintain homeostasis, as aberrant expression of IFN and ISGs
can promote diseases like chronic viral infection, cancers, neurodegeneration, and diabetes. Through a genome-
wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify proviral host factors and regulators of innate immunity, we identified
Capicua (CIC) as a novel regulator of innate immune responses, as CIC knockout (CIC KO) cells demonstrated
transcriptional upregulation of IFN and ISGs under basal conditions and showed restricted replication of different
RNA viruses. Based on studies in drosophila and cancer models, CIC, a highly conserved DNA-binding
transcriptional repressor, binds to a specific octameric sequence (CIC binding site or CBS) near target genes
and constitutively represses gene transcription. Through promoter motif analysis of ISGs upregulated in CIC KO
cells identified by RNA-Seq, we observed the presence of CBS motifs in several, but not all, upregulated ISGs,
including RIG-I, MDA-5, IRF3/7/9, IFNβ, IFNγ, IFIT1, TRIM22, MX1, and ISG15. Preliminary Assay for
Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC)-Seq analysis confirmed increased chromatin accessibility near the
putative CBS containing IFIT1 and TRIM22 promoters in CIC KO as compared to control A549 cells. In addition,
we validated direct CIC binding to IFNβ and ISG promoters (STAT1, IFIT1,TRIM22) by chromatin
immunoprecipitation-qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) analysis. Moreover, the CIC-ATXN1/L co-repressor complex is rapidly
degraded during influenza virus infection, suggesting that degradation of the CIC-ATXN1/L complex may be an
integral part of the innate immune response pathway. Importantly, the innate immune regulatory function of the
Cic-Atxn1/l co-repressor complex is conserved in the murine model. Based on these findings, we propose a
novel model for the transcriptional regulation of IFN and ISGs: under basal conditions, the CIC-ATXN1/L co-
repressor complex binds to CBS and represses ISG transcription; however, virus-induced proteasomal
degradation of CIC-ATXN1/L relieves these target genes from active repression, thereby allowing for robust
transcription through IRFs and STATs. The goal of this proposal is to gain mechanistic insights into the
transcriptional regulation of IFN and ISG promoters by the CIC-ATXN1/L co-repressor complex, ultimately
providing a new paradigm for the regulation of cell autonomous antiviral responses.

Latently infected brain myeloid cells including microglia (MG) and perivascular macrophages can serve as HIV
reservoirs, contributing to NeuroHIV persistence, chronic neuroinflammation and HIV-associated
neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Strategies aimed at eliminating HIV reservoirs are highly promising to cure
HIV, even in the presence of effective anti-retroviral therapy. Extensive studies including FDA-approved phase
I clinical trial have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of CRISPR/Cas genome editing to cure HIV.
However, a major barrier to the clinical application is the lack of effective and specific delivery to the targeted
disease-relevant tissues and/or cells in vivo, particularly in NeuroHIV. The overall objective of this proposal is
to develop AAV-mediated stealth cargo delivery of miniature Cas12f genome editor to the HIV cellular reservoir in
the brain. We will utilize novel PEG10-mediated endogenous retrovirus-like particle (ERVLP) technology that
relies on endogenous PEG10 and syncytin-A for Cargo(Cas12f) mRNA transfer into MG. This approach will
harness the benefits of the most promising AAV gene therapy. Several AAV serotypes such as AAV1, 2, 5, 6
can transduce MG (AAV-M) with >80% efficiency in vitro and in vivo, but cannot cross the blood-brain barrier
(BBB). In contrast, the currently available BBB-penetrating AAV serotypes (AAV-B) such as AAV9, PhP.B,
PhP.eB, F, B10 or B22 have low efficiency in transducing MG both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, novel AAV
serotypes that effectively cross the BBB and transduce MG (AAV-BM) are urgently needed. We hypothesize
that AAV-B can offer a one-time injectable systemic delivery of stealth cargo (cDNA) into astrocytes and/or
neurons thatin turn serve as relay stationsfor sustained mRNA/sgRNA transfer to MG. This stealth AAV cargo
will also include a designer exosome transfer into cells (EXOtic) device via CD63 linked with MG-specific peptide
(CD63M). We expect that PEG10-mediated ERVLP and CD63M-mediated EXOtic will synergistically boost the
endogenous spreading of HIV eradicator to MG. To accomplish this, we will first use the Cre-LoxP system for
proof of concept that MG-targeted exosome-enveloped ERVLP system (Exo-ERVLP) via AAV-B can efficiently
deliver Cargo(Cre)-mRNA in vivo from transduced astrocytes/neurons to non-transduced MG in LoxP-STOP-
LoxP (LSL)-tdTomato reporter mice (Aim 1). Then, we will assess MG-targeting and genome editing efficiency
of multiplexed Cas12f mRNA/sgRNA sustained delivery in LSL-tdTomato mice and HIV Tg26 transgenic mice
(Aim 2). Finally, we will explore the therapeutic potential of Exo-ERVLP AAV-B-Cas12f systemic injection in
HIV Tg26 transgenic mice (Aim 3). This high-risk high-reward proposal brings together several advancing
technologies and established teams with complementary expertise. The all-in-one multiplexed Cas12f/sgRNA
transgene is delivered via AAV-B, PEG10 cargo and CD63M EXOtic for sustained targeting and HIV
eradication. The expected positive outcomes will offer a novel tool to systemically deliver CRISPR/Cas editor
to MG, and provide new avenues for therapeutics development for multiple MG-related diseases."
10887330,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 From Greek philosopher Plato to recent animal and human studies, fasting has been recommended as a strategy to
slow down aging and reduce the risk of many aging related diseases, such as insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.
Understanding how fasting signals elicit cellular programs that establish “anti-aging” benefits will provide new therapeutic
targets and strategies to prevent aging associated pathologies and expand healthspan. My findings show that during fasting,
hepatocytes selectively remodel the translatome to activate a specific translation network of many longevity-related genes,
which is overlooked by conventional transcriptomics analysis. This new mechanism involves a phosphorylation event of
the major cap-binding protein eIF4E, which was perceived as a general translation factor. Strikingly, upon fasting,
phosphorylation of eIF4E is activated and exquisitely induces target-specific translation, including mRNAs involved in lipid
and glucose metabolism, despite that global translation is downregulated. Genetically inhibiting eIF4E phosphorylation
leads to a reduction of ketogenesis and insulin sensitivity upon fasting or a fasting mimic diet. Furthermore, my preliminary
data revealed that fatty acids (FAs), which are elevated in the blood upon fasting, are novel signaling molecules that induce
the phosphorylation of eIF4E. These findings reveal a new paradigm for control of gene expression at the level of the
proteome downstream of FA signaling that establishes metabolomic reprogramming and health benefits during fasting.
Intriguingly, aging blunts this activation of eIF4E phosphorylation, and lack of eIF4E phosphorylation in mice exhibits
early markers of insulin resistance at middle age. Thereby, I hypothesize that FAs activate a signaling pathway, that
modulates the eIF4E-dependent translation network of mRNAs involved in ketogenesis and insulin pathway upon fasting.
I further posit that dysregulation of this pathway during aging may be responsible for aging related insulin resistance. The
specific aims of this project is to first identify the molecular mechanism underlying FA induced translation control, which
includes identifying the functional cis regulatory motifs in mRNAs that render their specificity during fasting (Aim 1.1) by
mutagenesis and functional assays, and revealing the upstream signals that are induced by FA (Aim 1.2) through unbiased
labeling or a pull-down system coupled with mass spectrometry (MS). Secondly, I will determine the functional role of
phospho-eIF4E dependent translation in aging associated insulin resistance (Aim 2.1). I will set up an aging mouse model
employing eIF4E phosphorylation mutant mice coupled to metabolic assays and translatome analysis to detect how
phospho-eIF4E dependent translation control affects insulin sensitivity upon aging. I will also set up an aging cell model to
determine the mechanisms underlying the aging induced loss of activation of eIF4E phosphorylation upon fasting (Aim
2.2). This work will improve our understanding of FAs as signaling molecules that dynamically regulate cellular functions,
reveal a mechanistic link between fasting and aging-related diseases, open exciting avenues of research in understanding
the role of translation control on aging induced physiological changes, and identify novel therapeutic targets for aging
related metabolic diseases. This research will be carried out within the highly collaborative environment of UCSF and
supported by a multidisciplinary advisory committee with expertise in translation control, MS, aging, and diabetes."

Biomarker-guided treatment is key to improve outcomes of many diseases. The current COVID-19 pandemic
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global crisis due to lagged
vaccination and inefficient control of the virus, which has caused over 253 million cases and more than 5.1 million
deaths as of November 15, 2021. For potential new strains that may infect vulnerable populations or escape
from vaccination-mediated prevention, biomarker-guided specific therapeutics against broad strains of SARS-
CoV-2 as well as future corona viruses are still urgently required to prevent viral spreading and save human lives
from severe COVID-19. In exploration of soluble components in the plasma of COVID-19 patients during acute
infection and convalescent phase, we detected ACE2 expression in a subset of circulating exosomes and found
that the levels of ACE2+ exosomes (exoACE2) are associated with severity of COVID-19. Purified ACE2+
exosomes competitively blocked the SARS-CoV-2 infection through inhibiting the viral Spike protein with its
cellular receptor ACE2. We hypothesize that the exosomal ACE2 not only serves a biomarker for COVID-19
pathogenesis but also represents an innovative decoy therapy to treat all strains of coronaviruses that use ACE2
for viral entry. We propose two specific aims: (1) to establish a standard clinical assay for exoACE2 analysis;
and (2) to develop exoACE2 therapeutics against the current and future broad strains of coronaviruses. Two
academic institutions (Northwestern University and MD Anderson Cancer Center) will team up with the industry
partner ExoMira Medicine for collaborative translation of exoACE2 into clinical applications, i.e. biomarker-guided
therapy against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses."

Candidate: Dr. Natalie Nokoff is a Pediatric Endocrinologist whose research and clinical focus is on the
cardiometabolic health of transgender youth. The goal of her K23 proposal is to acquire the critical research
skills necessary to lead high-quality, patient-centered clinical research. This training will help her achieve her
long-term goal of developing a successful independent research program and becoming an international expert
on the impact of sex steroids on cardiometabolic health.
Background: Up to 1.8% of adolescents in the U.S. identify as transgender. Treatment of transgender females
(male sex and a female gender identity, MTF) may include pubertal blockade (gonadotropin-releasing hormone
analogue or GnRHa) in early puberty followed by estradiol later in adolescence. The impact of these
treatments on cardiometabolic health is understudied and unclear. MTF adults on estradiol have higher rates of
vascular events than non-transgender (cisgender) individuals.
Research Plan: Pubertal Blockade and Estradiol Effects on Cardiometabolic Health for Transitioning Youth
(PUBERTY) is a longitudinal observational study to evaluate the impact of GnRHa and estradiol on
vascular function and insulin sensitivity (IS). Young MTF (n=15) will be evaluated before and 6 months
after GnRHa. A separate cohort of MTF youth (n=40, ages 13-16 years, 20 who clinically received a GnRHa
and 20 who did not) will be evaluated at baseline, 6 and 12 months after estradiol. MTF youth will be compared
to cisgender youth (n=15 males, 15 females), adjusted to pubertal stage and body mass.
Career Development Plan: Dr. Nokoff’s research career development training activities include: 1) gain
expertise in design and conduct of clinical studies (implementation and completion of the PUBERTY study,
coursework and a PhD in Clinical Investigation); 2) lean how to perform and interpret vascular studies; 3) learn
new methods for assessing IS.
Environment: The environment for this project is exceptional with a strong academic Section of Pediatric
Endocrinology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and resources of the Colorado Clinical
and Translational Sciences Institute and Center for Women’s Health Research. Dr. Nokoff is faculty in the
TRUE Center for Gender Diversity, a comprehensive, multidisciplinary clinic serving over 1,000 transgender
youth, that will assure successful recruitment for this study. Mentors with expertise in endocrinology, insulin
resistance, vascular health, sex steroids, working with vulnerable populations, and clinical investigation are
invested in this candidate’s future and will be instrumental in supporting her research and career development.
Impact: The results of this novel study will improve the clinical care of transgender youth and yield information
on risk factors for future vascular events. Dr. Nokoff will gain invaluable skills in study design as well as
assessment of vascular and metabolic health, launching an impactful career as a lead clinical investigator."

 With partnering Native American communities, the UNM Metals Exposure and Toxicity Assessment on
Tribal Lands in the Southwest (UNM METALS) team has obtained evidence for community level exposures
and health risks associated with more than 1100 abandoned uranium mine (AUM) waste sites on their tribal
lands. Biomonitoring results confirm that community members are exposed to uranium and other metals
beyond national norms, leading to concerns about potential impact on health. Based on published and
preliminary findings, we will test the hypothesis that exposure to the unique mixtures of environmental metals
associated with AUMs promotes oxidative stress and inflammatory response, processes known to promote
immune dysregulation and development of numerous chronic diseases. Furthermore, we hypothesize that
dietary mitigation strategies can be elucidated based on mechanisms of toxicity of specific metals and metal
mixtures. In Aim 1 we will work to delineate associations between metals detected by biomonitoring, and
biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation and immune modulation. The findings from Aim 1 are expected to
provide critical information on systemic consequences of environmental metal exposures. Although uranium
has been the focus of community concern, findings from the UNM METALS Environmental Projects and
human biomonitoring highlight that other toxic metals are prevalent in the environment and present at elevated
levels in the population. Experimental studies in Aim 2 will focus on oxidative stress generated by community-
relevant metals and metal mixtures as an underlying mechanism leading to alterations in inflammatory
response and immune modulation. We will select experimental endpoints and exposure patterns observed in
the community to optimize human relevance of Aim 2 studies. Detailed mechanistic analyses will be performed
to establish the basis for metal interactions including potential beneficial metal-metal interactions of the
antioxidant metal micronutrients (zinc/Zn and selenium/Se). Studies on Zn and Se interactions with toxic
metals and metal mixtures may inform tractable strategies for mitigating the adverse effects of environmental
metal exposures in human populations. This project is responsive to community concerns and the outcomes
are expected to 1) provide insights into biological consequences of understudied toxic metals identified in
environmental samples and elevated in biospecimens from the community, 2) expand mechanistic knowledge
of the impact of specific metals and metal mixtures as well as the basis for metal:metal interactions in human
immune cells, and 3) experimentally test the potential of mechanism-based interventions to confer protection
from environmental metal exposures. BP Comm addresses SRP mandates 1, 2 and 4: Detection and

Abandoned uranium mines (AUM) situated on the tribal lands of the Navajo Nation and Laguna pueblo
represent a major source of environmental contamination that threatens public health as a result of
mobilization of toxic metals mixtures bearing uranium (U), vanadium (V), copper (Cu), arsenic (As). The
transport of toxic metals mixtures into the air in nanoparticulate form, and the subsequent potential for
inhalational and ingestion exposures, has never been investigated in a rigorous manner. The proposed
research will investigate the potential exposure hazards to toxic metals mixtures in nanoparticulates resulting
from inhalation and ingestion via contaminated agricultural crops from AUM sites located on Navajo Nation and
Laguna Pueblo tribal lands in Arizona and New Mexico. The project will address the two specific aims:
1) Understanding the physicochemical characteristics and distribution of metals mixtures in a range of
environmental samples, including mine wastes, soils (agricultural and background) and airborne particulates
around AUM and modelling their transport and deposition by wind into neighboring communities; 2) Assessing
the uptake of metals into plants on agricultural soils adjacent to abandoned mine sites to understand if airborne
metals-bearing particulates present a potential exposure risk. and 3) understanding the mechanisms of
particulate assimilation into agricultural crops through their root and folial system through experimental
stDeveloping a process model for the resuspension and transport of metal-bearing PM from AUM sites to
estimate exposure risks for nearby vulnerable communities. For the process model, we will a) ascertain the
particle size distributions and mineralogic characteristics of metal-bearing PM originating from AUM sites and
the exposure potential to vulnerable populations living in the regional airshed under varied meteorological
conditions; and b) conduct source-receptor modeling for the region, integrating information from three
performance sites and deriving long-term estimates for Navajo community members. The proposed research
will utilize state-of-the-art monitoring, chemical, imaging and atmospheric modeling techniques to provide a
comprehensive dataset on the concentrations, speciation, valence, solubility, etc., of ultrafine-grained PM
nanoparticle scale that are essential to evaluate the potential toxicity and inhalation exposure risk for PM. The
results will reduce uncertainty regarding the metal content, exposure concentrations, and sources of AUM-
related PM exposures in risk reduction strategies."

Gut relies on the work of the CEC and the DMAC. An overall theme of the studies is the understanding of how
metals present in or near mine sites in New Mexico might expose community members leading to
immunotoxicity. We focus on soluble and particulate forms uranium (U), and vanadium (V) given via oral routes
of exposure, because multiple exposures to these types of mixed metals has been observed in our community
partners. We have previously shown during Phase 1 that oral (45d) drinking water exposure of mice to U leads
to high exposures of GIT leading to significant changes in lymphoid and epithelial cells in the small and large
intestines. In SA1, mouse studies will explore in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro studies following exposures to uranyl
acetate (UA, soluble) and uranium citrate (UCit, insoluble nanomaterial), sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4,
soluble) and vanadium oxide (V2O4, insoluble). These metals will be explored alone and in combination with
other metals, including arsenic. Environmentally derived mine samples rich in carnotite will also be studied in
mice. We will screen for mRNA changes in small and large intestinal snips focusing on cytokines, oxidative
stress, and aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathways. An additional novel aspect of these studies is that
we will perform microbiome metagenomic analyses on the feces obtained from these mice, and we will screen
the feces using a large metabolomic panel to determine possible pathways responsible for immune
modulation. In SA2, we will examine the toxicity of these same metals and mixtures on human colonic
organoids obtained from normal human donors. We will assess metabolic changes in these tissues following in
vitro exposures and we will assess changes in epithelial barrier function using both organoids and human
colonic cell lines. Changes in transepithelial electrical resistances, mRNA and protein expression for
membrane tight junction molecules will be studied to understand mechanisms of barrier disruption. In SA3,
working with the CEC and BP Comm, we will examine stool samples from study participants in the community
for metal exposure, changes in inflammatory biomarkers, microbiome metagenomics, and metabolomic profiles
examined in SA1 and SA2. These studies will rely on statistical and mixed metal analyses developed by
DMAC. The ultimate goal of these studies is to address community concerns regarding exposure to mixed
metals from abandoned uranium mines and other hard metal mines leading to potential immunologic changes
and diseases. Data from these studies will inform communities through CEC on how to avoid exposures and
inform environmental projects (ESE PM, ESE Remed) on potential remediation of these sites."

corners region of the Southwestern United States. The University of New Mexico's Metals Exposure and
Toxicity Assessment on Tribal Land in the Southwest (UNM METALS) team has demonstrated that exposure
of individuals in the Navajo Nation to metal mixtures is associated with biomarkers of immune dysregulation
and living in close proximity to abandoned uranium mines correlates with levels of anti-nuclear autoantibodies.
This region is also a geographic epicenter for interstitial lung disease, silicosis and other chronic respiratory
disorders, which are linked to environmental exposures and systemic autoimmunity. It is currently not known
how inhaled metal-rich particulates drive extrapulmonary immunological dysregulation. In addition, the
contribution of different individual metals (e.g., uranium, vanadium, and iron) in driving these immune-mediated
changes has yet to be clearly defined. BioProject – Lung (BP Lung) focuses on investigating mechanisms of
metal-mediated immune dysregulation both locally in the lungs, as well as systemically following inhalation
exposure to metal-rich particulates. Thus, our main objective is to determine how these changes contribute to
pulmonary injury and autoimmune development. Because metals accumulate in bone and we have evidence
that inflammatory changes in the bone marrow niche mirror pulmonary responses following particulate
exposure, a second goal is to investigate crosstalk between the bone marrow niche and the lungs contributing
to metal particulate-mediated immune dysfunction. Our central hypothesis is that uranium and uranium-rich
particulate mixtures drive pulmonary and systemic immune dysregulation and autoimmunity through
hyperactive NETosis, in part by priming neutrophils for NETosis in the bone marrow niche. In Aim 1, we will
utilize a novel high content imaging, machine learning-based single cell platform to investigate how individual
metals alone or in combination with other metals and minerals contribute to oxidative stress, inflammation, and
NETosis using human, in vitro models. In Aim 2, we will use an autoimmune prone mouse model to determine
the role of neutrophils and NETosis in the development of airborne metal-mediated lung and systemic immune
dysregulation and autoimmune development using several established NETosis inhibitors. In Aim 3, we will
translate our mechanistic findings from Aims 1 and 2 to investigate associations between airborne metal
exposure and airway inflammatory mediators in individuals from Laguna Pueblo partnering community in
collaboration with BP Comm and CEC. This work is innovative and significant because it utilizes state-of-the
art tools to provide detailed understanding of the effect of neutrophils and NETosis as mechanistic targets and
driver of systemic immune dysregulation following metal particulate exposure and how crosstalk between the
bone marrow niche and the lungs contribute to these pathologies."
10890056,"SUMMARY: METALS Administrative Core
In Phase 2 of the UNM SRP Center -- Metals Exposure and Toxicity Assessment on tribal Lands in the
Southwest (METALS) -- our Administrative Core (AC) will provide leadership 1) to ensure our community-
partnered approach drives the integrated team research focus of METALS; 2) to enhance our translation to
communities, tribal and national regulatory agencies and policy-makers, and clinicians to reduce risks; and 3)
to serve as a model and a nucleus for environmental health research within our institution. The importance of
integration facilitated through our AC has also enhanced dialogue among communities, our research team,
and decision-makers, and developed METALS as a nucleus for environmental health science expansion within
our institution, leveraging new resources for expansion of our work through supplemental institutional funding
support and instrumentation. The strong partnership within our team will continue to build multi-directional trust
among our projects, cores, and stakeholders. The trust and strength of these partnerships have been
instrumental in the implementation of an ongoing clinical intervention trial, Thinking Zinc, through a
participatory design process that integrated strong science with cultural needs. The process of multi-directional
listening, understanding the basis for proposed design changes, and iteratively and collaboratively developing
a workable design has resulted in strong, longitudinal participation in this ongoing trial. This fundamental focus
for research that does not just identify problems, but seeks to designed evidence-based solutions with
community partners to reduce risk is at the core of the METALS renewal. Integrated community:researcher
teams in our research ensure community knowledge identifies sampling locations, exposure pathways, and
resources significant to the communities’ use and culture to ensure the relevance of our research and the
applicability of our risk-reduction interventions. The importance of the strong, trusted networks built through
METALS was underscored in our team’s ability to work through this existing network in response to COVID-19
to coordinate PPE purchase and distribution, support leadership decisions through analysis of local disease
trends and community risk factors to aid in pandemic management. In Phase 2, the AC will sustain and build
on our success through the following aims: Aim 1: Promote activities designed to enhance the participation and
impact of community partners on the direction and translation of METALS research to identify effective risk
reduction interventions. Aim 2: Facilitate activities structured to promote integrated research efforts among
METALS projects and cores that strengthen team diversity and team science. Aim 3: Continue to build the role
of our center and team as the nucleus of community-partnered research in environmental health within our
institution. Aim 4: Iteratively develop and amend logic models to evaluate progress on our aims as the
METALS Center, and support cores and projects in development of metrics to evaluate their component
progress through utilizing the Partnerships for Environmental Public Health Framework."

The intended outcome of this project is to advance the efforts for a nationally Integrated Food
Safety System (IFSS) through the advancement of the Animal Feed Regulatory Program
Standards (AFRPS) and to enhance State animal food regulatory programs and work related to
21 CFR Part 507 Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based
Preventive Controls for Food for Animals (CGMP and PCAF).
The Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) Food and Feed Safety Division (FFSD)
licenses and inspects approximately approximately 1,900 feed entities manufacturing,
distributing, and guarantying feed or feed ingredients in Minnesota. The FFSD has program
responsibility for animal feed and pet food and has a staff complement of 17 for feed-related
activities with eight devoted to field inspection and three assigned to pet food labeling, product
investigation and distribution. The MDA-FFSD also has multiple supporting units that include an
additional 20 staff who fully or partially assist the Commercial Feed Program in day-to-day
operations including compliance and enforcement, response and outreach, data management,
training support, and electronic systems maintenance. These staff also lead and coordinate
updates to procedures and processes including document management as well as achieving
and maintaining conformance with the AFRPS.
The MDA, as part of this application, will create a comprehensive project plan that outlines the
objectives and deliverables needed to maintain conformance with AFRPS and to incorporate
CGMP/PCAF implementation strategies into its regulatory activities, identify and fulfill training
needs and auditing programs to advance inspections under the Food Safety Modernization Act
(FSMA), build infrastructure and program improvement based upon the PCAF rule, maintain
regulatory authorities equivalent to 21 CFR Part 507 and FSMA rules, conduct outreach to
promote compliance with FSMA regulations, and participate in joint workplanning, enforcement,

G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of receptors for neurotransmitters and hormones,
and are therefore the largest group of targets for new therapeutics for a very broad spectrum of diseases
including neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic disorders. While initially thought to signal
exclusively through G proteins and function as two-state switches activated by hormones and neurotransmitters,
research over the past 30 years has revealed that most GPCRs have complex and diverse signaling behaviors.
A single GPCR can activate more than one G protein subtype as well as G protein independent signaling
pathways such as arrestins. Many GPCRs exhibit basal, agonist-independent activity. When considering one of
the several possible downstream signaling pathways, a drug acting at the orthosteric binding pocket may exhibit
one of four efficacy profiles. It may behave as an inverse agonist, suppressing basal activity, a full agonist,
maximally activating the pathway, a partial agonist, promoting submaximal activity even at saturating
concentrations, or a neutral antagonist, having no effect on basal signaling, but blocking the binding of other
orthosteric ligands. The efficacy profile of a given ligand may differ for different signaling pathways such that a
drug may behave as an agonist for a specific G protein subtype or arrestin while have no effect or inhibiting other
signaling pathways. This pathway selective (or biased) signaling has become an important consideration for drug
discovery, since one signaling pathway may produce therapeutic effects while another may lead to adverse
effects.
During the previous funding period we have applied cryo-electron microscopy and several biophysical methods
to characterize the structure and dynamic character of several Family A GPCRs, as well as a Family B and
Family C GPCR. These studies provide evidence that these GPCRs are highly dynamic and conformationally
complex. We hypothesize that this complexity is essential for their functional versatility, and believe that a more
detailed understanding of this complex conformational landscape will provide mechanistic insights into targeted
activation of a specific pathway with biased ligands. The goal of this proposal will be to understand the structural
basis for GPCR signaling through multiple pathways using methods that will provide high-resolution structural
constraints and characterize protein dynamics under more physiologic conditions."

10886205,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
CANDIDATE: As a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Scott Lowe’s lab at MSKCC, my research focuses on the
contribution of obesity-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), particularly hepatic lipid
accumulation, to liver metastasis from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). My long-term goal is to
establish an independent research program that aims to dissect the interactions between obesity/NAFLD and
metastasis, with the ultimate goal of exploiting this knowledge for therapeutic benefit. The proposed research
will form a solid foundation, on which I can establish my own research group by the end of the K99 phase.
RESEARCH: Liver is a frequent metastatic site for many cancers including PDAC, and liver metastasis is
typically associated with poor prognosis. Obesity-associated NAFLD is the most prevalent chronic liver disease
that affects ~25% of the population worldwide, and will become a predominant factor in shaping the niche for
metastatic cancers. However, how cancer mechanistically takes advantage of the lipid-rich and inflammatory
environment of NAFLD remains largely unknown. My early postdoctoral work show that liver metastasis
frequently co-occurs with hepatic lipid accumulation in patients, and fatty acid is a causal driver of PDAC liver
metastasis in mouse models of NAFLD. Moreover, in obese mice, the key lipolysis enzyme is unconventionally
elevated in hepatocytes adjacent to metastases, which accumulate fatty acid catabolite β-hydroxybutyrate
(βOHB) and upregulate Interferon-γ (IFNγ) responses. This proposal will test the hypothesis that metastasis
induces lipolysis in neighboring hepatocytes to provide fatty acids, which creates a multifaceted pro-metastatic
program. I will leverage functional genetics in mouse models to interrogate lipolysis in the niche hepatocytes
(Aim 1), and to determine the contributions of fatty acid-βOHB to epigenome (Aim 2) and IFNγ signaling to the
immune niche (Aim 3) in NAFLD-driven metastasis, with spatial analytics to validate these results in human
samples. These studies will illuminate the mechanisms that drive liver metastasis in obesity and NAFLD, which
could inform new strategies for therapeutic intervention in a growing population of patients.
ENVIRONMENT: MSKCC provides an ideal environment for me to accomplish my training and research goals,
and successfully transition to an independent faculty position at an academic institution. My mentor Dr. Lowe is
a world leader in cancer biology, with expertise on cancer genetics and mouse models. In addition, I have
assembled an advisory committee of established scientists with relevant expertise and strong commitment to
mentoring (Drs. Farese, Li, and Sherman). Together, all mentors will support my transition to independence by
providing valuable research experience and career guidance. With the collaborative environment and broad
spectrum of resources at MSKCC, this support network creates optimal conditions for the successful
completion of the proposed research and career development plans."

Among the 6.5 million adults with Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD)
in the United States, nearly a third of persons living with dementia (PLWD) receive care in the home healthcare
setting, many of whom are at the end of life with advanced dementia. Many often benefit from transition to
hospice when eligible and aligned with goals of care. Despite the benefits of hospice care for PLWD such as
improved care quality, fewer hospitalizations, and increased care partner support, racially and ethnically diverse
PLWD have disparately low rates of hospice use. Black and Latino PLWD have greater hospitalizations and low
hospice use at the end of life. Little is known about disparities in hospice use for Asians due to a lack of data
stemming from underrepresentation in AD/ADRD research. Preferences, cultural and religious beliefs, lack of
access, and mistrust may explain some inequities in hospice use. Culturally sensitive care management for
hospice care transitions has potential to improve end-of-life care for diverse PLWD; however, gaps in evidence
preclude the development of such interventions to improve hospice transitions for racially and ethnically diverse
PLWD. Thus, care management interventions, informed by health disparities and health equity research
frameworks and by end-users such as home healthcare professionals and care partners, that can be integrated
into existing care delivery models, are urgently needed. Home healthcare is a crucial intervention point for
increasing hospice use; however, care management that aligns with values, preferences, religious, spiritual, and
cultural needs of PLWD and care partners requires further study. This K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research
Career Development Award will provide the candidate, Komal Patel Murali, PhD, RN, ACNP-BC, with training in
AD/ADRD intervention development and clinicals, health equity research, and career development to progress
on a pathway to independence as an interdisciplinary nurse scientist and aging researcher focused on improving
end-of-life care inequities impacting diverse PLWD and their care partners. The specific aims for this career
development award are to: 1) Co-design a culturally sensitive care management checklist to guide hospice
transitions for Black, Latino, and Asian PLWD and their care partners receiving home healthcare, 2) Pilot test
the culturally sensitive care management checklist within care management for feasibility, acceptability, fidelity,
and usability for Black, Latino, and Asian PLWD and care partners and HHC professionals, 3) Examine hospice
enrollment, time to enrollment, and care partner satisfaction at 1-month and 6-month follow up with Black, Latino,
and Asian PLWD and their care partners. This study is conceptually guided by the National Institute on Aging
Health Disparities Research Framework, the Equity-Focused Implementation Research Framework, and the NIH
Stage Model for Intervention Development. The intervention will be delivered within usual care management
surrounding hospice transitions within a large home healthcare agency in New York City and will inform the
development of a subsequent R01 clinical trial."
10886206,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The menopausal transition (MT) in midlife is a critical juncture where women experience life transitions and
adverse physiological and psychological changes that increase the risk for hypertension (HTN) and
cardiovascular diseases in later life. Physical activity (PA) improves blood pressure (BP), biomarkers of HTN,
sleep, mood, and well-being; however, Hispanic women meet PA at lower levels than non-Hispanic White
women. A potential explanation is that interventions to increase objectively measured PA are rarely designed
to engage, measure, and test the key mechanisms responsible for PA behavior. In addition, contextually
appropriate PA interventions specific to the needs of midlife Hispanic women are lacking. The purpose of the
proposed mixed-methods K23 Patient-Oriented Research Mentored Career Development Award aims provide
the necessary training, mentorship, and research to fill the current gaps in the PA literature. The training and
mentorship objectives of the proposed K23 project build upon the candidate's previous training and clinical
experience as a registered nurse to focus on the following four areas: 1) understand the menopausal- and
aging-related health and endocrine changes of midlife women; 2) develop and evaluate interventions targeting
behavior change mechanisms based on the NIH Stage Model; 3) increase proficiency in employing
community-based participatory research and cultural competence; and 4) accelerate professional
advancement and leadership development. The candidate has assembled a mentoring team consisting of
renowned leaders and experts in aging, menopause, behavior change, intervention development and testing,
community engagement, and Hispanic health to guide her throughout the K23 award period. The training and
mentorship will promote achievement of the following specific aims: 1) identify and operationalize the
behavioral, psychological, and social mechanisms that drive PA behavior of midlife Hispanic women; 2) employ
community-based participatory research with midlife Hispanic women to develop a novel PA intervention
targeting key behavior change mechanisms with the goal of increasing objectively-measured PA among
sedentary midlife Hispanic women in the community setting; and 3) examine the feasibility of the PA
intervention among sedentary midlife Hispanic women in the MT with elevated BP, exploring changes in PA
behavior mechanisms, PA minutes, BP, biomarkers of HTN, menopause symptoms, sleep, mood, and well-
being. Findings from this K23 will inform a large-scale randomized clinical trial to test the intervention to
improve PA behavior mechanisms, PA, health, and well-being of midlife Hispanic women in the community
setting. Completion of the K23 mentored training and research activities will provide the necessary knowledge
and skills to develop the candidate's long-term research goal to employ community-based participatory
research to develop sustainable interventions to ameliorate the adverse health changes experienced during
the MT to promote health and well-being to improve health disparities among midlife Hispanic women in aging."
10886331,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A prolonged hospital stay after cancer surgery is a common but potentially avoidable problem that negatively
impacts quality of care. Goal-directed pathways for discharge are widely used in surgical oncology to avoid
unnecessary extended lengths of stay, but discharge milestones are maintained by the clinical team without
patient input. The resultant discharge pathways are rigid, with little or no personalization, and the necessary
steps in the process are often unclear to patients. These gaps in communication and mismatch in expectations
between clinical care team members, patients, and caregivers contribute to excessive lengths of stay.
Integration of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) into clinical care is one strategy shown to improve
communication and align expectations. There may be great opportunity to use transition-of-care–focused
PROs items in the hospital setting to align patient and clinical team members during discharge planning to
prevent prolonged hospital stays. Hypothesis: A discharge-focused electronic PROs tool for surgical oncology
patients will decrease the length of stay after elective surgery. PROs including readiness for discharge and
activation will also be measured. Jennifer Cracchiolo, MD, has developed an electronic PROs tool, “Goals to
Discharge” (G2D), for oncology patients focused on discharge planning to augment currently established
discharge pathways. While the G2D tool has been successfully employed during hospitalization and patients
have responded, there have been challenges to implementing this technology, including helping patients
navigate the digital tool; devising strategies to increase response rates and ensure inclusivity; optimizing the
content; and developing PROs-prompted clinical decision support for clinicians. In the proposed project, Dr.
Cracchiolo will refine the library of actionable PROs items that measure domains relevant to inpatients and
their readiness for hospital discharge. She will include patients from surgical oncology (colorectal, thoracic, and
gynecologic surgery) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, with the goal of actively engaging patients
during the discharge process. Aim 1: Refine content for the G2D tool with PROs-based clinical decision
support. Aim 2: Systematically plan for broad clinical adoption of G2D using an implementation mapping
approach. Aim 3: Pilot test the effectiveness of the G2D tool compared with usual care. Results will lead to
better quality of care, better informed patients, and better outcomes. This research, along with the career
development plan for training in advanced qualitative methods, implementation science, and clinical trial study
design by her multidisciplinary mentors, Deborah Schrag, MD, MPH; Jamie Ostroff, PhD; Andrew Vickers,
PhD; and Thomas Atkinson, PhD, will provide Dr. Cracchiolo with the infrastructure needed to grow in her
career and facilitate her progress toward independence as a researcher in clinical integration of PROs systems
in surgical oncology care."

Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS) is a type of HUS caused by infection with Shiga
toxin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-producing enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (STEC), a foodborne
pathogen, resulting in bloody diarrhea. HUS follows the diarrheal prodrome, with the highest incidence in young
children. Pediatric mortality from STEC-HUS has improved in the last 20 years, but children still have significant
morbidity secondary to chronic or end-stage kidney disease. Adult mortality is higher, especially in the elderly.
The pathophysiology of STEC-HUS is hallmarked by endothelial injury secondary to Shiga and LPS toxemia,
and there is increasing evidence to suggest that the alternative complement pathway (AP) is overactivated in
STEC-HUS. The AP is part of the innate immune system, responsible for ridding the body of foreign invaders. In
the “tick over” hypothesis of AP activation, a low level of the hydrolyzed form of complement factor C3 (C3H2O)
is continuously formed. Upon forming a complex with C3H2O, complement factor B (FB) is cleaved by complement
factor D (FD) to yield the initial C3 convertase, C3H2O-Bb, which proteolyzes C3 into C3a and C3b. AP activation
continues with heterodimerization between C3b and FB and subsequent cleavage of FB by FD, yielding the C3
convertase, C3bBb, that amplifies C3 proteolysis into C3a and C3b. Rapid inactivation by complement factors H
and I limits AP amplification. However, activation of C3 by non-complement serine proteases brings the paradigm
of the “tick over” hypothesis into question. Expression of the serine protease tissue kallikrein 1 (KLK1) is elevated
in models of endotoxemia. The role(s) for this inflammatory serine protease in mediating AP overactivation in
the setting of STEC-HUS has not been explored. The investigators have demonstrated that KLK1 cleaves factor
C3 of the AP in the fluid phase. This application proposes biochemical studies using cellular and animal models
to test the hypothesis that the non-complement serine protease KLK1 significantly contributes to the AP
overactivation that is associated with STEC-HUS. These studies will determine the impact of non-canonical
mechanisms of AP activation and open a new area of research on complement biology in microangiopathic and
infectious diseases."

Project Goals: To maintain implementation of AFRPS and coordinate with FDA to implement
best practices for animal food regulatory work. By achieving and maintaining implementation of
these program Standards, the NCAFP can better direct their regulatory activities toward
preventing animal food safety hazards, that can cause illness or injury to animals or humans, in
facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold animal food materials/supplies.
Project Objectives: The NCAFP will achieve and maintain implementation of the AFRPS,
which is recognized as a critical element to creating a national, fully integrated food safety
system. The NCAFP further commits to contribute to the continuous improvement of the AFRPS
through attendance at an annual face-to-face meeting, active participation in committees, and
other Initiative supporting the AFRPS. This includes the development strategies for achieving
and maintaining implementation of the AFRPS that can be replicated or leveraged across state
programs to promote national consistency. To aid in further development of an Integrated Food
Safety System, the NCAFP will work to provide a foundation for supporting advisory/regulatory
action based upon findings of regulatory activities conducted by State animal food regulatory
programs and commits to research and coordinate with FDA to identify and implement best
practices for State animal food regulatory work performed under the scope of 21 CFR Part 507

Diabetes mellitus significantly delays the healing of epidemic wounds as well as oral wounds, posing a difficult
clinical challenge for oral surgeries such as tooth extractions and free flaps. The lack of comprehensive
knowledge regarding the effects of diabetes on oral mucosal health hinders the design of effective treatment.
Our long-term goal is to identify novel therapeutic targets to improve diabetic wound management. In our
preliminary study, we discovered that long-lived Wnt-responsive cells are stem cells in oral epithelia. These cells
reside in the basal layer of the oral epithelium and maintain the tissue’s turnover and barrier function by precisely
balancing proliferation and differentiation. In response to injury, Wnt-responsive cells prioritize proliferation over
differentiation, producing abundant progeny to quickly re-epithelialize the wound. In diabetic mice, we recently
discovered that oral epithelia exhibit a decreased turnover rate and reduced structural protein expression. The
overall objective of this proposal is to determine how diabetes affects the quantity, distribution, activity, and injury
response of oral epithelial stem cells using both in vitro and in vivo models. Our central hypothesis is that diabetes
disrupts the microenvironment of oral epithelial stem cells, impairs stem cell fate, and thus adversely affects
epithelial barrier function and wound healing. Two independent but interconnected aims are proposed. In AIM 1,
we will determine the alterations that occur in oral epithelial stem cells and their niche under diabetic conditions.
Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that diabetes negatively impacts oral epithelial stem cells and
their niche, leading to slowed tissue turnover and compromised barrier function. A novel lineage-tracing strain
will be used to examine the quantity and activity of Wnt-responsive cells in an adult-onset type 2 diabetes model,
which closely resembles patient metabolic characteristics. Niche signaling will be interrogated by an in vitro 3D
coculture model. In AIM 2, we will define the key mechanisms responsible for delayed diabetic wound healing.
We hypothesize that the ineffective response of epithelial stem cells to injury is the primary cause of the
compromised healing of diabetic wounds. We will challenge control and diabetic mice with a traumatic oral ulcer
model and monitor the healing process, focusing on stem cell activation, proliferation, migration, and
differentiation. Results from this proposal will demonstrate for the first time the extent to which diabetes alters
epithelial stem cells in homeostasis and wound healing. These results are expected to have positive impacts, as
a comprehensive understanding of the compromised state of epithelial stem cells under diabetic conditions will
facilitate the development of effective therapies to enhance wound management."
10886227,"Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common liver tumor in children, believed to have the fastest rising incidence
of all pediatric solid tumors. Unfortunately, HB has a poor overall survival rate in patients that present with high-
risk disease, including metastatic, relapse, or treatment refractory tumors. These high-risk patients can expect a
dismal survival rate of less than 50% due to the limited success of current therapies, including aggressive
chemotherapy and surgery. Treatment failure in these patients is attributable to the spread of refractory
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) that intravasate into blood vessels in the primary tumor, survive in systemic
circulation, seed distant sites or other areas of the liver, lay dormant as minimal residual disease (MRD), and
multiply after therapy is stopped. Therefore, a key unmet clinical need is to elucidate how CTCs drive this process
of therapy resistance and metastasis, which critically hinders therapeutic success. Our overarching goal is to
thoroughly characterize the molecular underpinnings of the metastatic process to inform the design of target-
guided precision therapies. Our rigorous preliminary data demonstrates our innovative pipeline for identifying
and sequencing CTCs from primary patient liquid biopsies and supports a role for NRF2 in HB vascular invasion
and metastasis. We hypothesize that HB dissemination is driven by upregulation of NRF2 activity initially caused
by chemotherapy exposure, which can be targeted to minimize or eliminate metastasis, MRD, and recurrence.
In Aim 1, we will assess NRF2 activity differences among primary liver tumor, CTC, and lung metastasis samples
and between chemotherapy naïve and treated samples with (a) co-IP, IF, proximity ligation, reporter, and mass
spectrometry imaging (MSI) assays with samples collected from our novel, clinically relevant orthotopic cell line
and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) murine models of HB and (b) IF, single cell RNA-seq, and MSI with primary
patient samples. In Aim 2, we will manipulate NRF2 activity in vitro and in vivo with shRNA, overexpression,
CRISPR, and small molecule inhibitor strategies and evaluate specific effects on phenotypes related to
dissemination with assays for metabolism (MSI), migration (Incucyte) and invasion (transwells), and CTC and
metastatic burden in our animal models. In Aim 3, we will test the efficacy of clinically relevant small molecule
inhibitors that target oncogenic pathways activated by NRF2 (a) in vitro with assays for viability (MTT), migration
(Incucyte), and invasion (transwells) and (b) in vivo with assays for tumor weight and volume (MRI), CTC burden,
and incidence of metastasis. Our interdisciplinary team is uniquely positioned to perform these studies with our
innovative, validated murine models and our unparalleled access to primary patient tissue and whole blood
samples. Overall, these rigorous studies will lead to a thorough understanding of the role of NRF2 in HB tumor
cell dissemination and inform the use of multiple targeted therapies for high-risk HB patients."

 Zinc binding metalloproteins and metalloenzymes constitute ≈10% of the vertebrate metalloproteome
and are essential for many cellular processes. Due to the critical importance of zinc to vertebrate physiology,
zinc deficiency leads to numerous pathologies and is involved in the pathogenesis of many neurological
disorders. In fact, zinc is one of the most prevalent metal ions in the brain where it serves important roles in
neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and differentiation. Zinc deficiency constitutes a pervasive public health
problem considering that approximately half of the world's population suffers from dietary zinc deficiency, now
the fifth most important risk factor for mortality in developing countries. Despite the known importance of zinc
cofactors to cellular function, the mechanisms by which zinc levels regulate tissue homeostasis remains poorly
defined.
 Cellular zinc homeostasis is modulated by a specialized family of zinc trafficking proteins called
metallochaperones. It is speculated that metallochaperones facilitate the hierarchical delivery of metals to their
client proteins thereby regulating cellular and organismal homeostasis. We have identified the first vertebrate
zinc metallochaperone, which we recently named Zinc regulated GTPase metalloprotein activator 1 (ZNG1). We
demonstrated that vertebrate ZNG1 binds to and transfers zinc to metalloproteins to promote their enzymatic
activity. Further, we identified numerous candidate ZNG1 client zinc metalloproteins in zebrafish and mice that
are associated with brain function, including the zinc-finger transcription factors, ZFHX3 and ZFHX4. Collectively
these findings suggest that ZNG1 is a regulator of brain development and function via interactions with specific
Zn-requiring transcription factors, which will be tested by experiments proposed in this application.
 This work is expected to determine the impact of ZNG1 mediated zinc transfer on transcription factor
activity in the brain (Aim 1) while defining the ZNG1-dependent ZFHX3 and ZFHX4 signaling pathways important
for neuronal development, neuronal response to stress, and behavior (Aim 2). Completion of these aims has the
potential to identify ZNG1 as a factor that modulates signaling in the brain in a manner that is dependent upon
zinc bioavailability. These findings will shed light on the in vivo role of the first discovered zinc metallochaperone
and will vertically advance our understanding of zinc homeostasis and contributions to the progression of human
neurological disorders."
10886970,"Abstract: The gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as an important contributor to a range of human
physiological processes and is attracting increasing attention as a dynamic area for the development of
therapeutics. To realize the potential of the gut microbiome in a therapeutic context, animal models are
necessary to generate causal, mechanistic data describing host-microbe interactions. While mice and fish have
been critical in generating foundational microbiome data toward this goal, they have key genetic, physiological,
and behavioral differences from humans that can interfere with the translation of findings. Non-human primates
share many genetic, physiological, and behavioral traits with humans, increasing their translational potential.
Although non-human primates are used for research across the NIH, they are currently underutilized in
microbiome research and have not been systematically validated as models in this context. Given the
significant investment required for non-human primate studies, it is especially important to characterize which
models are best suited for particular questions as we seek to examine how microbiomes impact human health
and disease. Here we propose to develop non-human primates as valuable model organisms for functional
studies of the human microbiota. Specifically, we aim to identify the best uses for different non-human primate
species in microbiome research. We will generate baseline microbiome (shotgun metagenomics, analysis of
SCFA concentrations, untargeted metabolomics) and physiological data (metabolic panels, immune cell
populations, serum metabolomics) from humans and five non-human primate species commonly used as
biomedical models (marmosets, owl monkeys, squirrel monkeys, baboons, and macaques). These data will
allow us to determine which non-human primate species model different taxonomic and functional features of
the human gut microbiome and to measure the consistency of host-microbiome interactions across human and
non-human primate species. Our efforts hold potential to unlock critical insight about the utility of longstanding
non-human primate biomedical models for different aspects of microbiome research and will ultimately help
researchers accelerate the translation of microbiome discoveries into clinical settings. By identifying how well
different non-human primate species model humans in a subclinical context, the proposed project will lay the
groundwork for future R01 proposals that use non-human primate models to interrogate host-microbe
interactions in a disease context. Overall, this line of inquiry will facilitate future studies targeting key questions
about host-microbe interactions with a high potential for translational science and medical benefit."
10887177,"Project Summary
Biologic encapsulation in polymers has long been utilized to control their release. While this approach may be
well suited for hydrogels with an aqueous solvent, encapsulation within hydrophobic polymers is complicated by
solvent incompatibility. To address this, the double emulsion technique provides a standard method to emulsify
proteins and polymers together and form encapsulated microparticles. However, this results in low encapsulation
efficiency and burst release profiles due to non-specific surface adsorption of the protein to the polymer’s surface.
Meanwhile, hydrophobic small molecule drugs are routinely encapsulated into hydrophobic polymers by co-
dissolving drug and polymer in the same organic solvent prior to particle formation. This allows for evenly
dispersed drug in the polymer matrix and sustained release profiles. Ideally, bioactive proteins would also be co-
dissolved in organic solvent such as dichloromethane to provide the same matching of polymer-protein miscibility
and even dispersion in the polymer matrix.
Here, we aim to address this unmet need by wrapping bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) with stabilizing
random heteropolymers to form amphiphilic polymer-protein hybrids. We hypothesize that precise tuning of the
polymer chemistry will protect BMP-2 from denaturing while endowing it with solvent/polymer miscibility. To
facilitate this complex formulation process, we will use active machine learning on a robotic platform through an
established Design-Build-Test-Learn workflow (Advanced Materials 2022). In Aim 1, we will implement multiple
cycles of this workflow to continuously evolve a Gaussian process regressor to predict new generations of
copolymer designs with each cycle. Experimentally, the model will be trained on BMP-2 release data from
microparticles. In Aim 2, lead BMP-2 polymer-protein hybrids will be used to form BMP-2 encapsulated
microparticles, optimized for tunable release, and compared to microparticles prepared by double emulsion.
Also, fluorescently labelled BMP-2 will be encapsulated and visualized by confocal microscopy to study drug
dispersion within the polymer matrix. Ultimately, this project will provide proof-of-concept for our proposed
platform technology which may allow better methods for biologic encapsulation in hydrophobic drug release
systems."

This project will investigate how different environmental, personal and disease related factors contribute to the
experience of behavioral symptoms of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients with AD will experience
behavioral symptoms of dementia (BSD) at some point during their illness, though most patients will not
experience all types of BSD or experience them in a predictable pattern. This has made development of effective
treatments and symptom management approaches for AD highly challenging. Our pilot data shows a high degree
of intraindividual heterogeneity in daily reports of BSD both in type of symptom and frequency of occurrence.
Others report significant intraindividual heterogeneity in the rate of change in BSD over a 3-month period. It is
currently unclear what mechanisms contribute to these within- and between-person variations in BSD. While
BSD subsyndromes have been proposed it is unclear how the types of BSD within the subsyndromes are
temporally dependent or distinct from each other. As applied to AD, the Revised Symptom Management Model,
points to environmental (i.e., unmet needs, stressors), personal (i.e., genetic, microbiome, ethnicity), and disease
(i.e., HSV1 infection, systemic inflammation) factors as mechanistic pathways for BSD. We hypothesize that
these factors across multiple systems contribute to the mechanistic development of BSD, and thus the variability
in individual BSD expression. Elucidation of these factors across multiple systems will help create personalized
approaches to treatment of BSD spanning from caregiving behavioral training to pharmacological interventions.
Dyads of co-residing caregivers and persons with AD or mixed-type AD (with vascular involvement) (N=162
dyads) will be recruited. Equal numbers of Caucasian and Hispanic dyads will be enrolled so that the contributing
role of ethnicity can be examined. Using a micro-longitudinal design, caregivers will complete daily diaries for 30
days reporting on their observations of environmental exposures, including type, frequency, duration, and
severity of BSD. At enrollment and at the start of each new week of diaries, dyads will visit the research clinic
where blood and stool samples will be collected from the person with AD (for 5 samples total). BSD will be
reported in the daily diary entries, with BSD type measured as presence or absence of 22 symptoms across 17
domains. We will use a multi-level model analytic framework to examine hypotheses outlines in the research
strategy in order to complete the following aims: (1) Determine how environmental (i.e., unmet needs, stressors),
personal (i.e., genetic, microbiome, ethnicity) and disease (i.e. HSV1 infection, systemic inflammation) factors
impact probability of daily BSD, either directly or through interaction effects, and (2) Identify subsyndromes of
BSD, and predictors of group membership. Impact: By competitively testing leading hypotheses for BSD, this
project will elucidate criteria for distinguishing patients with BSD that are not resolvable via appropriate attention
to their unmet needs. Findings from this project will inform targeted interventions to support persons with
Alzheimer's disease and their family caregivers."
10888132,"The neurological importance of the gene for the neuronal alpha3 subunit of the Na/K pump, ATP1A3, is
underscored by the severity and range of symptoms produced by its missense mutations: motor, cognitive,
and psychological. This project uses an integrated interdisciplinary approach. It includes phenotyping on
patients with input on new phenotypes and mechanistic factors. Because new phenotypes are being
discovered incrementally, a gene-first search for variants, phenotypes and risk factors in databases linked to
clinical data should accelerate that. Variants need to be validated, so there will be laboratory tests of
pathogenicity and mechanism, and FDA-approved drugs will be tested for rescue. The purpose is to generate
a comprehensive natural history of symptoms and progression needed for future clinical trials, and preclinical
data for potential treatments. With ATP1A3 there is an extraordinary range of symptoms including severe
infantile manifestations, but the focus here is on the syndromes that manifest in youth and adults: still with a
heavy burden, but perhaps also with more immediate hope for treatments that improve the quality of life.
We have found that the breadth of symptoms from impaired ATP1A3 activity includes cardiac
rhythmogenesis, and in the brain, we have found patients with focal atrophy and others with only reduced
metabolism by MRI, where there is hope of restoring function. Moreover, ATP1A3 disease overlaps with many
neurologic syndromes, including but not limited to autism, dystonia, parkinsonism, psychiatric disease, and
epilepsy. We anticipate that the results of the proposed work will also point to how Na,K-ATPase dysfunction
contributes to these more common diseases.
Our goal now is towards a treatment by refining our understanding of ATP1A3 mutation phenotype diversity and mechanisms. The aims are as follows: Aim 1) Expand the breadth and reach of ATP1A3 phenotyping, using diagnostic tools to detect ATP1A3-related disease and measure changes over time,
necessary for designing treatment trials. Aim 2) Assess ATP1A3 mutations as both causative and risk factors
for disabling diseases by using a genotype-first approach to search existing large population and disease specific
sequence databases for ATP1A3 variants and correlate these with phenotypic data from linked
electronic health records (EHR) or disease specific phenotype data. Because ATP1A3 mutations are almost
entirely missense and heterozygous, the damaged protein must have to be present, leading to Aim 3):
Investigate multiple mutations from patients for protein misfolding in rigorously comparable isogenic cell
lines. This will test the hypothesis that different symptom clusters have a basis in the cell’s responses to
misfolding: adaptation or apoptosis. For mutations that do misfold, test FDA-approved and new misfolding
corrector drugs for efficacy. In perspective, both longitudinal phenotyping and knowledge of mutant protein
function will be essential for selecting the patient subgroups for either pharmacologic or gene therapy trials."
10888223,"Abstract
Bladder and bowel complications have consistently been rated as of the upmost importance by
the spinal cord injury (SCI) population. Importantly, both bladder and bowel distention have
been identified as primary triggers of autonomic dysreflexia (AD) in individuals with cervical and
upper thoracic level lesions (majority of SCI population), a systolic blood pressure rising often
more than 20 mmHg and remaining at these values with intolerable symptoms (pounding
headache and/or chills, for example). We have recently documented as part of our current R01
this massive unmodulated sympathetic reflex which causes widespread vasoconstriction
(presenting as severe hypertension) as a limitation for bladder capacity in numerous research
participants. Anecdotally, many who use clean intermittent catheterization for bladder
management report using AD symptoms daily as a signal of bladder fullness and time for
emptying, an unsafe practice that needs addressing. Additionally, we and others have
documented in questionnaires regular occurrences of AD symptoms during bowel programs and
in ongoing lab-based studies there have been numerous instances of AD upon insertion of a
rectal probe either for bladder cystometry (for recording abdominal pressure) or during anorectal
manometry. The goals of the current multi-disciplinary study incorporating critical cross viscero-
visceral intersystem interactions are 1) to investigate in a controlled laboratory setting and then
with mobile at-home monitoring the extent, severity and frequency of occurrence of AD with
respect to daily bladder and bowel function, in conjunction with identifying potential underlying
mechanisms by examining urinary biomarkers for several specific vasoactive hormones, and 2)
to regulate cardiovascular (CV) function therapeutically as part of bladder and bowel
management using spinal cord epidural stimulation, which our CV team have shown can
normalize blood pressure."
10888265,"Project summary/Abstract: In response to Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Complement in Basic
Immunology (CIBI), we propose to examine the causative effect of complements in the pathogenesis of severe
COVID-19. The complement system is activated via one of three pathways—classical, alternative, and
mannose-binding lectin (MBL)—which converge at C3 cleavage, leading to the formation of C3 and C5
convertases and concluding with assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC). MAC is a cytolytic
macromolecular pore that can insert into host cell membranes under pathological conditions. Extensive
evidence obtained from others and us indicates that the complement (C) system, in particular MAC, may
participate in mediating endothelial damage, activating the coagulation pathway and platelets, and causing
multiple organ damage leading to severe COVID-19. However, the causative roles of C and MAC in severe
COVID-19 have not been experimentally investigated. The proposed studies will utilize our newly developed
state-of-the-art tools to block or modify the C activation products to investigate the role of C in endothelial cell
damage, platelet activation, and thrombosis formation seen in severe COVID-19, including therapeutic
paradigms. To address our needs, we have established and characterized an animal model of severe COVID-
19 using SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice. The mice develop acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS), progressive weight loss, and mortality at 7 days that is associated with severe interstitial inflammation,
perivascular inflammation, platelet activation, and thrombosis in the lungs. We also observe (i) endothelial cell
(EC) dysfunction of the alveolar septa; (ii) increased vascular permeability associated with the extensive
activation of immune cells (e.g., lung macrophage cells); and (iii) increased C3 and MAC deposition in
pulmonary vasculature. In addition, single-cell RNAseq shows C activation and coagulation in the lungs of this
severe COVID-19 model. These results have prompted us to hypothesize that the C in general, and MAC in
particular, significantly contribute to the EC damage, platelet activation, and thrombosis formation seen in
severe cases of COVID-19. Aim 1 will investigate whether the inhibition of C activation and MAC formation will
reduce EC damage and platelet and coagulation pathway activation in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18 mice. Aim 2
will test the hypothesis that the restriction of MAC formation will protect against EC damage and activation of
the myeloid cells, leading to reduced platelet and coagulation activation in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18 mice.
Aim 3 will investigate the role of C in the pathogenesis of SAR-CoV-2 infection in a clinically relevant paradigm and
evaluate site-targeted C inhibition as a treatment for COVID-19. help us better understand the role of C activation
and the MAC in pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, open a new avenue to prevent and treat COVID-19, and foster
the development of new therapeutic strategies involving modulation of the C system."

 Youth in foster care have unique experiences and significantly higher trauma load which greatly increase their
risk for a range of negative social, behavioral, academic, physical and mental health outcomes. However, despite
documentation of many negative outcomes associated with child welfare involvement, there remains
heterogeneity in outcomes from foster placement. Most research concludes that foster care is not a cause of
worsened outcomes, and that supportive and stable foster care environments have the potential to improve child
wellbeing in the short and long term. Given this, more research is warranted to understand the risk and protective
factors present for foster youth which may be modified through the foster care environment and caregiving.
Understanding what differs from child and caregiver perspective, between those who experience better and
worse outcomes, is critical for understanding how to increase likelihood of positive development following foster
care placement. The overarching goals of this K08 proposal are threefold. First, the study aims to use existing
large-scale longitudinal data collected on youth in the child welfare system to explore critical risk and resilience
factors for youth in foster care and whether these are moderated by transracial placement. Second, this study
aims to document the parenting practices used by foster parents, their thoughts on the trainings they receive,
and their perception of the impact this has on their foster child's functioning. Third, this study will interview key
stakeholders (e.g. child welfare workers and foster parents) to assess the current barriers and facilitators of
current foster parent trainings, as well as their perception of topics covered and gaps in training, in order to inform
future intervention adaptation or development.
 To achieve these aims, the candidate and multidisciplinary mentorship team have developed a comprehensive
training plan that delineates a series of training and research goals. These goals will incorporate training in
quantitative and qualitative research methods, as well as intervention development and evaluation. The training
and resultant findings will capitalize on existing expertise and provide additional, focused training to allow for the
development of a multimodal research program that will position the PI to lead future federally funded
multidisciplinary studies with translational implications for populations of youth who experience trauma and/or
parental separation. The proposed research represents an important contribution towards advancing our
understanding of the risk and protective factors present for youth in foster care, and how to support foster parents
through parenting intervention in order to improve adjustment outcomes for foster youth. The institutional
environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing an independent research line that ultimately aims to
improve the psychosocial outcomes for youth who experience parental separation."
10887104,"Project Summary and Abstract.
Candidate: My primary career objective is to lead a research program focused on preventing secondary insults in spinal
cord injury (SCI) patients. This proposal is an extension of established skills in small molecule detection with focused time
to learn new skills; 1) defining associations between early interventions and rehabilitation trajectories, and 2) clinical trial
methodology. Environment: This proposal will be pursued under the mentorship of Drs. Shutter and Sowa, both
neurotrauma experts actively leading translational clinical trials with a record of training independent trialists. The U. of
Pittsburgh is a premier program with established infrastructure that includes institutionally approved protocols
incorporating the proposed research, a biobank of over 100 stored patient samples, and all necessary equipment and
supplies. Research: Traumatic SCIs result in devastating disability. Following the initial traumatic insult (i.e. primary injury)
local tissue injury initiates a cascade of mechanisms that lead to prolonged ischemic and cytotoxic cell damage (i.e.
secondary injury). We lack strategies to limit pervasive secondary cell damage known to amplify disability and undermine
recovery potential. The central hypothesis guiding this proposal is that cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) serotonin and
adenosine represent sensitive biomarkers detecting secondary injuries. This study represents the first step in developing
effective treatment strategies to ameliorate secondary injuries and limit SCI disability. This proposal includes two
independent phases, a retrospective analysis of hypoxic cell damage (K99), and a prospective evaluation of cytotoxic cell
damage (R00), both utilizing high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of CSF samples. All spinal serotonin
originates from brainstem raphe nuclei with descending projections to facilitate synthesis, delivery, and local intracellular
storage at terminals near sensory and motor synapses. Rodent SCI models demonstrate transient spikes in extracellular
serotonin with amplitudes correlating to degree of motor deficit; suggesting serotonin is a biomarker for cellular damage.
Using stored CSF samples from human subjects with traumatic SCIs, I demonstrate analogous serotonin spikes following
ischemic cell damage (i.e. secondary injury). The objective of aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that [secondary] ischemic
cord injuries increase CSF serotonin levels in human SCI subjects. Human neurons exhibit a limited capacity for structural
recovery, and serotonin release is theorized to be an indication of irreversible cell damage. It therefore benefits us to
identify biomarkers for “at risk” tissue, prior to irreversible damage. Extracellular (i.e. CSF) adenosine levels correlate to
degree of hypoxic stress with levels increasing during progressively severe and prolonged hypoxia. In aim 2 I will test the
hypothesis that CSF adenosine levels increase with degree of cord hypoxia, prior to ischemic injury. Spinal hematomas
and cord inflammation lead to non-ischemic cytotoxic cell damage as blood products and pro-apoptotic cytokines promote
cell damage/death. In aim 3 I will test the hypothesis that CSF serotonin is a sensitive biomarker for cytotoxic cell
damage. Future studies will compare the capacity for molecular, imaging and physiological biomarkers to direct acute
interventions that may limit SCI disability."
10887106,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Long term survival of pediatric heart transplant (HT) patients remains unacceptably low and is driven in part by
modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. Children with HT engage in low levels of moderate to vigorous physical
activity (MVPA), which is a major health problem for a population already at increased cardiovascular risk and
further contributes to their morbidity and mortality. Increasing MVPA may be a critical way to improve
cardiovascular health, quality of life, and survival in this population. While environmental exposures are
associated with physical activity in children without HT, their effects in those with HT are unknown, and likely
different. To design effective, equitable, generalizable, and sustainable interventions to increase MVPA, we
need to recognize the environmental determinants of MVPA and involve stakeholders in intervention
development. Jonathan Edelson, MD, is a pediatric cardiologist and physician-scientist passionate about
understanding how physical activity can improve outcomes of children after HT. With a mentoring team
specializing in implementation science, Dr. Edelson will 1) develop expertise in mobile health technology and
accelerometry; 2) hone the skills to design, launch, oversee, and complete a multisite, prospective
interventional study; and 3) gain methodologic expertise in geospatial and qualitative methodology. This study
proposes to leverage Dr. Edelson's existing mobile health studies of pediatric HT patients to evaluate the
macro and micro environmental determinants of MVPA in pediatric HT and to pilot an exercise intervention
using the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST). Specific Aims are to 1) Determine the association of the
macro-environment with MVPA in a socioeconomically diverse cohort of children after HT; 2) Use qualitative
methodology to identify micro-environmental determinants of participation in physical activity in pediatric HT
patients; 3) Determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a digital exercise program in pediatric HT
patients. Dr. Edelson will map participant addresses to neighborhood-level built and natural environmental
exposures to estimate the association of MVPA patterns with macro environmental factors. He will then
conduct semi-structured interviews informed by the COM-B (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behavior)
implementation science framework with patients and their families to identify determinants of physical activity
and desirable components of a mobile health exercise intervention. Finally, he will apply the knowledge gained
to the development and implementation of a prospective pilot longitudinal exercise intervention using MOST, a
strategy for developing multi-component intervention which has successfully informed physical activity
interventions. This K23 award will support Dr. Edelson's pathway to becoming an independent investigator in
the interventional space with skills that will support future R level proposals using exercise in a large multisite
cohort to improve long-term outcomes. This work will provide a novel framework for exercise interventions that
will be applicable to a range of populations, further highlighting the public health significance of this proposal."

Most biochemical reactions take from hundreds to billions of years to occur spontaneously. However, life depends
on highly organized networks of catalyzed chemical reactions that proceed not only rapidly, but specifically and
with high fidelity. Biological catalysts are enzymes, complicated molecular nanomachines that massively
accelerate reactions by positioning specific substrate molecules with such precision that they are compelled to
react. The molecular mechanism by which an enzyme executes this remarkable feat involves an exquisitely
orchestrated sequence of steps. The structures, mechanisms, and functions of enzymes are all products of
millions of years of evolution. Yet despite their fundamental biological importance, we have only a rudimentary
understanding of the atomistic basis of the evolutionary changes that create novel enzymes.
In this project, we will fully elucidate, at an atomistic level of description, the biophysical principles that underlie
the evolutionary changes in structure, dynamics, and mechanism producing novel enzymatic functions. We will
resurrect entire evolutionary lineages of ancestral enzymes, solve their structures, characterize their dynamics,
and determine their kinetic mechanisms, all correlated with the functional changes observed along these
evolutionary trajectories. While we are aggressively pursuing multiple systems to maximize success, our main
model system is the malate and lactate dehydrogenase (M/LDH) superfamily. Both enzymes are found in the
core metabolism of nearly every organism on the planet. M/LDHs are homologous enzymes that share a fold and
catalytic mechanism yet can possess extraordinarily strict specificity for their substrates. The evolution of this
family is marked by many important functional innovations, including (1) sharp alterations in substrate
specificity, (2) changes in catalytic rate, (3) gain of allosteric control by small effector molecules, (4) acquisition
of thermophilic, cryophilic, halophilic, and alkalophilic stability, and (5) the evolution of multimerization via new
protein-protein interfaces. Many of these novelties are convergent, having evolved several times independently.
How do complicated, highly orchestrated kinetic mechanisms evolve? How do substitutions far from the active
site affect activity? What is the molecular basis of epistasis? Does specificity increase during evolution? Were the
ancestors of M/LDHs promiscuous? By answering these questions, we will provide the first fine-grained
description of how enzyme structures and kinetic mechanisms constrain and channel genetic evolutionary
processes. The M/LDH superfamily is a classic, well-characterized system, with a common kinetic mechanism
and cofactor. Hence, the resulting evolutionary insights will apply broadly to other enzymes and may transform
our understanding of how enzymes can be rationally engineered."
10871812,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) hold promise for the treatment of a wide range of neurological disorders
common to Veterans such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Parkinson’s disease. In addition to providing cells
for transplantation-based therapies, NSCs are also an important source of human neurons and glia for drug
discovery and development. To realize the full potential of NSCs for human therapy, it is important to understand
the molecular mechanisms that regulate the production of specific neural cell types. Our long-term goal is to
understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which NSCs produce specific types of neurons and glia.
The postnatal and adult mammalian brain harbors NSCs in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ).
Importantly, V-SVZ NSCs retain distinct regional identities that dictate the production of different neuronal
subtypes. For instance, NSCs in the ventral V-SVZ produce neuron subtypes different from those born from
NSCs in the dorsal V-SVZ. How NSCs “remember” their regional identity has been unclear. Mixed lineage
leukemia-1 (Mll1) encodes a chromatin regulator that is part of an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional
memory system, and MLL1 is required for normal V-SVZ neurogenesis. Recently, we showed that MLL1 is
required for the maintenance of NSC regional identity. Even transient inhibition of MLL1 activity causes ventral
NSCs to “forget” their regional identity and generate neurons more typical of dorsal NSCs. This change in
developmental potential with transient MLL1 inhibition corresponds to persistent changes at the level of the
transcriptome and chromatin-state. The objective of this proposal is to understand the role of MLL1 in
maintaining NSC identity. Based on Preliminary Studies and our previously published data, our central
hypothesis is that MLL1 is required to maintain NSC identity via specific changes to chromatin architecture. In
this renewal application, we propose to investigate the function of MLL1 in maintaining key aspects of NSC
identity. Given that NSC identity is a critical aspect of their neurogenic potential, results obtained will have
important implications for our ability to produce specific types of neurons for human translational research and
transplantation therapies. The proposed studies may inform methods in which transient MLL1-inhibition is used
to broaden the developmental potential of NSC populations by “erasing” their regional and temporal identity.
Furthermore, these studies advance new basic, neurodevelopmental concepts regarding NSC identity, which
may be important to understanding how mutations in human MLL1 cause Weidemann-Steiner Syndrome, a
developmental disorder that includes intellectual disability and autism. Finally, discovering MLL1-dependent
mechanisms at genomic regulatory elements will likely be of interest to the broader fields of neurodevelopment,
epigenetics and stem cell biology. Our published results, Preliminary Studies, and expertise in V-SVZ and
chromatin biology support the feasibility of these Aims."

populations may contribute to higher incidence rates of chronic diseases among rural cancer survivors. Higher
rates of opioid use among cancer survivors and among rural populations are a concern, but few studies are
available on rural cancer survivors. The Population-Based Rural Cancer Survivors Cohort will include rural
prostate, breast and colorectal cancer patients diagnosed from 1997 to 2015. The cohort will be developed
with the Utah SEER Cancer Registry, which has data linked to the Utah Population Database (UPDB), and
includes electronic medical records, statewide healthcare facility data, residential histories, family history
records, and the All-Payer Claims Database (APCD). We will also develop cohorts for the same cancers in the
SEER-Medicare data focusing on the elderly population including all SEER registries in the data other than
Utah. The specific aims of our study are: 1) to assess the risk of diabetes, CVD and depression among rural
breast, prostate and colorectal cancer patients in comparison to their respective urban cancer patient groups in
a population-based cohort. We will further investigate whether cancer treatments contribute to adverse
outcomes among rural cancer survivors. 2) to evaluate the risk of opioid use disorders among rural breast,
prostate and colorectal cancer patients in comparison to urban cancer patients and the association of opioid
use disorders with survival, 3) to estimate the comorbidity trajectory over time after cancer diagnosis, as well
as risks of diseases in the major body systems among rural breast, prostate and colorectal cancer patients in
comparison to their respective urban cancer patient groups. Aim 3 will allow for capture of potential new
outcomes that may be more important among rural cancer survivors. Our study is innovative in assessing the
risk of long-term disease incidence among rural cancer survivors for the first time, with a longitudinal approach,
in a large-scale population-based cohort in Utah and in the elderly in the US. Our Population-Based Rural
Cancer Survivors Cohort will contribute significantly to rural cancer survivorship by identifying specific
outcomes that are more common among rural cancer survivors for prevention of disease and improved
survival. We will also identify potential modifiable factors that can be targeted for rural cancer survivors with
interventions such as access to care with telemedicine and tobacco cessation. Future directions include the
development of risk prediction modeling specifically for rural cancer survivors, that would help to identify rural
cancer survivors at high risk who would benefit from specific preventive interventions."
10871897,"The graduate-level training program “Interinstitutional Program in Cell & Molecular Biology”
addresses the demands of changing job prospects, an urgent need to increase diversity in the
scientific community, and the importance of enhancing ethics and rigor in research. The
program unites three internationally recognized research and educational entities, the University
of Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and Carnegie-Mellon University,
all in close proximity within one of America’s most livable cities. The merger of these distinct
entities capitalizes on pre-existing connections between these groups, such as the Pittsburgh-
area membrane trafficking group, which is now in its 18th year of organizing annual meetings
and courses. The merger of the three groups also broadens training potential, particularly with
respect to available expertise and infrastructure, and emphasizes the importance of scientific
collaboration to the trainees. Indeed, to capitalize on these strengths, each trainee will have a
co-mentor from one of the other institutions. The administrations at each institution are fully
committed to the research plan, and Faculty in the program were chosen based on past training
outcomes or (for younger Faculty) future potential. The Faculty encompass diverse areas of
expertise in basic cell and molecular biology, professional ranks and backgrounds, and will
participate in robust mentor training, which strengthens their ability to develop personalized
training programs and to mentor trainees both daily and at twice-yearly thesis meetings. The
result will be a personalized and supportive training plan that is rigorously monitored using
objective assessment tools. Faculty labs within the program attract outstanding and diverse
trainees with career goals that span a wide spectrum. Dual mentorship brings a breadth of
scientific approaches and an increased base of professional contacts. Thanks to culling from the
best of the participating departments, trainees will attend outstanding courses and seminars that
collectively hone critical thinking, enable broad knowledge, introduce cutting-edge technologies,
emphasize scientific ethics and rigor and reproducibility, and highlight career and professional
development opportunities. Additionally, instruction and practice in communication skills,
including participation in outreach and classroom teaching, will be an integral feature of the
program. In sum, the program will recruit and retain a diverse trainee cohort that will be provided
with a tailored and collaboration-focused pathway, preparing them for entry into a range of
career paths open to PhD recipients in cell and molecular biology."
10871898,"Pancreatic beta-cells synthesize large quantities of insulin. Growing evidence indicates that any of a number of deficiencies in insulin biosynthesis (genetic, or acquired) can lead to diabetes. We know that insulin biosynthesis begins with translation of preproinsulin. This short-lived precursor must be translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), signal peptide excised, and proinsulin properly folded in order to undergo successful export from the ER for delivery to the distal secretory pathway in which proinsulin-to-insulin processing and insulin storage in secretory granules finally occurs. In contrast, unsuccessful molecules may be degraded before they are even translocated into the ER, or may be restrained from anterograde export from the ER — indeed, strong evidence indicates that misfolded proinsulin molecules are targeted for degradation. Secretory pathway protein degradation also involves other endogenous substrates that contribute to the differentiated pancreatic beta cell phenotype. The competing continuation of this multi-P.I. R01 will help clarify how three major mechanisms of secretory pathway protein disposal – pre-translocation degradation; ER-Associated Degradation (ERAD); and Autophagy – are all critical for proper beta-cell function. This proposal continues the longstanding association of three tightly collaborative investigators (Qi, Tsai, Arvan) that are experts in exactly these processes: preproinsulin translocation into the ER lumen with the subsequent folding/misfolding of proinsulin, secretory pathway protein degradation via ERAD, and an ER-to-lysosome degradative pathway that we believe is primarily ER-autophagy (ER-phagy). We have strong reason to believe that defects in these quality control mechanisms are linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D) as a result of insulin insufficiency, and this belief is supported by preliminary data. In this proposal, we seek to examine three interlinked areas related to the early secretory pathway of pancreatic beta-cells. For one, we will pursue studies in which infidelity of preproinsulin translocation across the ER membrane is directly linked to deficient proinsulin and insulin biosynthesis, leading directly to diabetes. Second, we will follow-up on some remarkable preliminary data demonstrating that de-differentiation of pancreatic beta-cells is triggered by a loss of efficient ERAD function, also leading directly to insulin-deficient diabetes. Finally, we not only delve deeply into the ER factors that trigger ER-phagic degradation of misfolded proinsulin, but we also propose a deeper understanding of how ineffective or improper ER-phagy can trigger beta cell failure, which also leads directly to insulin-deficient diabetes. These new research directions lead us to pursue a novel therapeutic approach to beta-cell secretory pathway dysfunction focused on stimulating intracellular protein clearance mechanisms, in order to prevent diabetes onset and/or limit its progression."
10872302,"Technology Research and Development Project 5: Top-Down for the Masses
Abstract
Strong arguments exist for utilizing intact proteins as the primary unit of measurement in mass spectrometry-
based proteomics. The proteoform hypothesis, which suggests that it is specific proteoforms that are most tightly
linked to phenotype, resonates strongly with researchers performing both translational and basic science. In the
previous granting period, the NRTDP developed potent quantitative workflows for discovery science and applied
these workflows to myriad biological systems. In recognition of our duty to foster a broader community, we have
chosen to create an entire TR&D focused on making our quantitative workflows robust enough that they can be
exported to non-expert labs through Community Engagement. To accomplish this, each step in these
workflows, from sample preparation and separation to mass spectrometric detection and data analysis will be
innovated to improve robustness. New sample preparation technology coupled with more robust, higher flow
chromatography will alleviate issues related to nanoflow chromatography. Cleaner samples coupled with field
asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) will also improve mass spectrometer up-time. In addition to
improved hardware robustness, the resource will also publish updated software tools, including AUTOPILOT
ACQUIRE, TDPORTAL and TDVIEWER, which include streamlined quantitative data acquisition, processing, and
analysis workflows. The combination of these innovations will give the resource the capability to efficiently export
the experiments developed in-house to a community that has a growing appetite for performing experiments that
are proteoform-resolved."
10872330,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Half of incident disability in older and middle-aged, adults with chronic conditions occurs after hospitalization. Often this
cascade begins with mobility disability, a condition which affects 31 million adults in the United States and leads to loss
of independence, increased health care utilization, and earlier mortality. Higher levels of physical activity after hospital
discharge are associated with reduced disability; however, prospective interventions to promote and sustain healthy
physical activity are currently lacking. We have successfully piloted a novel approach using behaviorally designed
gamification and social support for physical activity promotion during a 12-week intervention among adults discharged
from the hospital (N=232). The intervention led to larger increases in physical activity among older and middle-aged
patients (age 50 to 65), those with higher social engagement, and lower baseline step counts.
Our proposed study will build on results of this pilot to target a broader population of at-risk adults hospitalized for 1 of 3
chronic Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions affected by physical activity (hypertension, diabetes, and mild-moderate
heart failure). Since high social support was found to lead to larger effects in the pilot study, we will add a virtual health
coach to the intervention design to help patients increase their support levels. The goals are of this study are to increase
physical activity after discharge from the hospital to reduce incident mobility disability associated with acute illness and
to reduce acute and post-acute care utilization. We will also evaluate the sustainability of this approach over a longer
period (6 months intervention, 6 months follow up) and qualitatively assess factors associated with higher or lower
performance in a population with significant ethnic/racial and socioeconomic diversity. To achieve these goals, we have
assembled an expert multidisciplinary team in behavioral economics, geriatrics, nursing science, clinical trials and
implementation. We will study the novel application of this approach to patients who are discharged from Penn Medicine
hospitals and follow them for 12 months after discharge. We will focus on 4 specific aims: 1) To evaluate the
effectiveness of a 6-month intervention using gamification with social incentives and personalized coaching to increase
physical activity among adults age ≥ 50 with chronic conditions at risk for disability (primary outcome); 2) To evaluate
the sustainability of increased physical activity during a 6-month follow-up period (secondary outcome); 3) To evaluate
the impact of physical activity on disability and acute care utilization during the study period (secondary outcomes); and
4) To conduct a mixed-methods process evaluation to explore factors associated with strong or poor response to the
interventions. Our approach aligns with NIA's strategic priority to develop effective interventions to maintain function
and prevent or reduce disability and also with national efforts to create an Aging Friendly Health System through the
spread of scalable, sustainable, and cost-effective interventions."
10869792,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects one in one hundred babies and is the leading cause of infant mortality
in the US1. Single ventricle (SV) physiology is among the most complex and high-risk CHD diagnoses, in which
patients are born with only one functional pumping chamber in the heart. These patients are typically palliated
with three open heart surgeries culminating with a Fontan procedure, subjecting patients to a lifetime of elevated
venous pressures and high rates of morbidity and mortality. As many as half of Fontan patients degenerate
into heart failure and required a transplant by the age of 25. However, for a subset of patients with borderline
SV physiology, drastic improvements in outcomes can be achieved if a bi-ventricular circulation can be restored.
Despite these advantages, current reconstruction procedures require “on the fly” surgical planning in which the
surgeon must customize a baffle design for each individual patient in the operating room. Computational modeling
is well positioned to address these needs by providing surgical teams with predictive simulations. However,
current simulation capabilities are hindered by several key factors: 1) anatomic models are laborious to construct,
2) there is a current lack of data characterizing CHD hearts, including material properties, fiber orientations,
and Purkinje system structure and these quantities are critically needed for accurate simulations, and 3) current
solvers do not combine all the relevant physics for whole-heart simulations. We aim to address these needs by
developing a pediatric cardiac simulator to support surgical planning in complex congenital heart disease
and to deploy it in a prospective clinical study. To accomplish these goals, we propose the following three
specific aims: 1) To Enable Rapid Patient Specific Model Construction of Topologically Unique CHD Hearts With
Machine Learning Methods Based On Signed Distance Fields. 2) To Characterize Mechanics and Microstructure
in CHD Hearts Using Ex Vivo MR Acquisition and Finite-element Based Inverse Modeling. 3) To Prospectively
Demonstrate and Validate a Novel Multi-Physics Cardiac Solver for Biventricular Reconstructive Surgical Planning
in CHD Patients. Our proposed study will tightly integrate image processing and machine learning, advanced
experimental magnetic resonance image acquisition methods, and development of state-of-the-art multi-physics
finite element solvers (combining fluid and solid mechanics, active contraction, valves, and electrophysiology)
to address an immediate clinical need in a high-risk and understudied patient population. A primary goal is to
demonstrate improvements in short-term clinical outcomes before the end of the project. This proposal brings
together an interdisciplinary team comprising experts in computational modeling of cardiovascular biomechanics,
advanced MRI methods, microstructural and mechanical tissue characterization, and pediatric cardiac surgery.
Our translational objectives are: 1) improve outcomes for borderline single ventricle patients, and 2) to advance
the state of the art in cardiac simulation capabilities for broad applicability across CHD and cardiac surgery."
10872109,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This application proposes renewal of an integrated program for predoctoral training in biostatistics, focused on
preparing trainees for careers in cardiovascular disease research. The escalating demand for skilled
biostatisticians equipped to address ongoing and emerging challenges in cardiovascular disease research calls
for out-of-the-box training. The proposed program formally integrates extensive experiences in multidisciplinary,
collaborative environments; mastery of the theoretical underpinnings of statistics required for rigorous application
of sophisticated biostatistical techniques and development of new methodology; and strong underpinnings in
communication and leadership skills. The program will be a joint effort of the Department of Statistics at North
Carolina State University (NC State), the Duke University Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics (B&B),
and the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI). It capitalizes on the long-standing partnership between the two
doctoral programs and the largest academic clinical research organization in the world, with internationally known
researchers at the forefront of cardiovascular disease and related research. The five-year program will support
five trainee positions in the NC State Department and two positions in Years 1-3 and three in Years 4-5 in Duke
B&B, with average duration of appointment 2-3 years. In addition, NC State will provide two additional matching
slots and DCRI will provide two additional slots in each year for trainees transitioning from training grant funding.
Trainees at each institution will pursue rigorous study of statistical theory, including probability, inference, linear
and other statistical models, advanced probability, and advanced statistical inference; and of statistical methods,
including clinical trials design/analysis, longitudinal data analysis, survival analysis, and cutting-edge topics, such
as record linkage, machine learning, parallel computing relevant to biomedical Big Data. They will also receive
training in fundamental aspects of biology and cardiovascular medicine as well as research responsibility and
ethics; and extensive formal and experiential training in communication and leadership skills. Trainees will be
introduced to DCRI cardiovascular disease research gradually and evolve to full collaborative apprenticeships
in which they are integrated as functioning members of DCRI project teams. Through this apprenticeship and
formal courses and seminars, trainees will develop considerable working knowledge of cardiovascular medicine
that will position them to make immediate contributions to cardiovascular disease research upon completion of
the program. Each trainee will be assigned an inter-institutional mentorship team comprising a biostatistician
mentor at each of NC State and B&B and a clinician mentor whose primary affiliation is at DCRI, which will
collaborate in guiding them through all aspects. Dissertation research will involve development and evaluation
of novel statistical methodology inspired by challenges encountered in trainees’ collaborations. Trainees will
benefit from exposure to different cultures across both institutions, broadening their perspectives and access to
courses, seminars, and other resources."
10872112,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Critical care is the most complex, resource-intensive and costly care setting contributing over $130 billion to
national health expenditures annually. Approximately 4 million patients are admitted to intensive care units
(ICUs) each year with average mortality rate ranging from 8-19. Recently COVID-19 has highlighted that
staffing interprofessional teams in ICUs is quite challenging. One feature of healthcare staffing that has
received much attention in settings outside of the ICU is continuity of care – whereby a patient is cared for by a
small team of identified professionals over time – has been long recognized as an essential attribute of high-
quality, patient-centered care. In primary care, greater continuity of patient care is associated with fewer
emergency department visits and hospitalizations, lower healthcare costs, and higher patient satisfaction.
Continuity-based acute care staffing models also exist, but are rarely adopted and sustained in practice,
particularly in ICUs where continuity-based assignments can be challenging to operationalize. Importantly,
although critical care is delivered by interprofessional teams of physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists,
continuity of interprofessional ICU teams has never been conceptualized or measured before. Without this
knowledge, it is difficult to know whether hospitals and administrators should prioritize continuity of ICU care,
which could be a missed opportunity to improve quality of patient care and outcomes in this critically ill, costly
patient population. The overall goal of our study is to examine the effect of continuity of ICU
interprofessional teams on patient outcomes and organizational economic outcomes, in order to
develop an interprofessional assignment decision-support tool that optimizes the continuity of
interprofessional ICU team care. We propose to examine the quality and costs of an interprofessional team
continuity staffing approach in ICUs to guide future interventions in 13 ICUs across two different healthcare
systems using data from over 2 years. We will examine interprofessional team continuity of shift-level ICU
clinician teams (a nurse, a physician, and a respiratory therapist) assigned to each patient during the ICU stay.
We define two dimensions of team continuity: intra-professional continuity, measuring each of the clinician’s
experience caring for the patient previously during the patient’s stay, and inter-professional continuity,
measuring the clinicians’ joint experience working together as a team. We hypothesize that care delivered by
shift-level ICU teams with higher intra- and inter-professional continuity will result in improved patient outcomes
and reduced costs. Our research team has a strong record of joint publications on attributes of patient care
teams including continuity of care with expertise in health economics, critical care nursing and medicine and
engineering. Completion of the study will generate the most robust evidence, to date, to inform organizational
priorities about continuity-based interprofessional staffing in ICUs, to improve care for critically ill ICU patients."
10869217,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Seventy percent of sepsis patients show some degree of acute diffuse neurological impairment. Importantly
about half show chronic neurocognitive impairments, ten percent of which are noted to be severe. In older
individuals the incidence of sepsis is significantly higher as is the risk of long-term severe cognitive impairment.
Given the rapidly increasing numbers of aged individuals and the significant economic and functional burden
that this poses to the individual and the families of these patients, identifying neuroprotective therapies to prevent
long-term changes in the brains of sepsis patients is of high significance to the field. This is particularly important
since increasing data suggests a strong link between sepsis and later development of dementia, an aspect that
is recapitulated in rodent AD models, were sepsis increases pathology associated with this disease. However,
despite the high incidence and clinical relevance of neurological disturbances during and after sepsis, the
pathological mechanisms underlying both acute and chronic neurological dysfunction are not fully understood.
To date, there are no effective therapies to treat or mitigate these long-term sequalae.
 A key emerging mechanism linking sepsis to cognitive impairment involves immune cell infiltration into the
CNS secondary to blood brain barrier dysfunction during the acute phase of the infection. To this end, we have
identified that the luteinizing hormone receptor agonist, hCG, which we have previously shown to protect
cognition in aging menopausal and AD mouse models, has powerful anti-inflammatory effects within the brain.
These are in line with the expression of this receptor by microglia and excitatory neurons in the brain but also
parallel the established role for this hormone in the periphery where, during pregnancy, it is a major regulator of
key immune cells (i.e. neutrophils and monocytes) that are known to infiltrate and cause cognitive dysfunction in
sepsis models. Therefore, we seek to address whether 1) hCG will prevent long-term cognitive dysfunction
associated with sepsis in aged mice and 2) whether these benefits are associated with the regulation of
peripheral cell infiltration and/or centrally mediated pro-inflammatory mechanisms. Notably, given the
involvement of this inflammatory mechanism in other neurological disorders (TBI, neurogenerative disorders,
stroke) the mechanistic evaluation of LHCGR agonists can be readily generalizable to other CNS conditions that
impact the aged brain."
10873161,"Shared decision making (SDM) occurs when patients and clinicians collaboratively make medical decisions
that align with a patient’s values and preferences. It is a core component of the patient-centered medical home.
It is especially important for adolescents with chronic conditions and their parents or guardians (hereafter
parents) given the frequent need for medical decisions among these patients and their families. Yet, there is a
critical gap: no SDM measure has been developed to measure adolescent SDM (aSDM). Without a reliable
and valid measure of aSDM, it is impossible to evaluate the extent to which: aSDM has occurred, aSDM
impacts outcomes, or interventions designed to facilitate aSDM are successful. In alignment with PA-16-424
(Developing Measures of Shared Decision Making), our objective is to create the first SDM measure to
explicitly incorporate the pediatric patient’s role in aSDM and measure their perspective. An SDM measure
developed specifically for use with adolescent patients is needed because SDM with adolescents is
fundamentally different than SDM with adult patients or with parents of younger children. Unlike most SDM,
which occurs between two individuals (the adult patient or young patient’s parent and the clinician), aSDM with
adolescents occurs among at least three people (the adolescent patient, their parent, and the clinician). Thus,
our measure will explicitly evaluate, from the patient’s and parent’s perspectives separately, the extent to which
each of these three individuals engages in aSDM.
To develop our measure of aSDM, we will employ PROMIS measure development methods. These methods
have never been used to develop and validate any SDM measure. Our specific aims are to: Aim 1: Refine the
dimensions of aSDM from adolescent, parent, and pediatric clinician perspectives. Aim 2: Develop a measure
of aSDM that incorporates aspects of the decision triad (adolescent, parent, clinician) and separately measures
aSDM from the adolescent and parent perspectives. Aim 3: Demonstrate the aSDM measure’s reliability,
validity, acceptability, and ability to feasibly measure SDM in clinical settings. We will conduct qualitative
interviews with adolescents with chronic conditions, parents of adolescents with chronic conditions, and
clinicians who care for adolescents to refine the dimensions of aSDM. We will demonstrate the measure’s
reliability, validity, feasibility, and acceptability in a sample of 500 adolescents with chronic conditions and 500
parents. The expected outcome of our proposal is a reliable and valid measure of aSDM that is feasible for use
in clinical settings for research, quality improvement, and performance measurement. Our proposal is
innovative because 1) it will be the first SDM measure developed specifically for adolescents and 2) the first
study to apply PROMIS standards to the development of any SDM measure. Our proposal directly addresses
multiple AHRQ priority populations: children, adolescents, and individuals with special health care needs."
10873162,"Underuse of evidence-based medications for chronic disease, driven in part by high out-of-pocket (OOP)
medication costs, accounts for substantial preventable morbidity and mortality due to exacerbation of chronic
illnesses. This underuse, and the resultant adverse health outcomes, are worse for patients who are Black,
Hispanic, or Latino, and those who live in rural areas. Addressing gaps in cost information may reduce OOP
spending and improve underuse. Sometimes clinicians prescribe more expensive agents when less costly,
equally effective medications exist, in part because, until recently, they lacked information regarding what
patients must pay for a particular drug. OOP cost information could also help patients and clinicians make
treatment choices that are consistent with patient preferences and goals. In 2019, the University of Colorado
Health System (UCHealth) implemented in all ambulatory care sites a Real-Time Benefit Tool (RTBT) that
shows clinicians a patient’s OOP medication costs—the cost the patient would pay at a pharmacy—in the
Electronic Health Record. Medicare policy supports RTBTs and will increase its implementation. Because cost-
related medication underuse is significant among racial/ethnic minority and rural populations, a RTBT has the
potential to increase guideline-concordant care in these populations and decrease disparities. On the other
hand, use of RTBT may be less frequent among populations with chronic conditions who are Black, Hispanic,
Latino, or in rural areas due to differences in where care is received (e.g. telemedicine), health literacy and
language, cultural identity and norms, medical system behaviors that erode trust, or interpersonal and
structural racism within the health care system. The project will focus on patients with asthma, atrial fibrillation,
diabetes, or depression—common chronic conditions for which there are both costly and low-cost clinically
effective drugs—and measure (1) outcomes among patients who are Black, Hispanic, or Latino, or who live in
rural areas and (2) how these outcomes differ compared with other patients with the same chronic conditions.
We will use unique UCHealth data linking clinical medication orders, pharmacy claims, patient data (including
race, ethnicity, other demographics, and health status), and RTBT data to assess variation in RTBT use and
whether the RTBT is associated with patients’ first medication fills. We will use the Colorado All-Payer Claims
data and a difference-in-difference design to measure the impact of the RTBT on use of medications consistent
with national evidence-based recommendations and on poor health outcomes. We will characterize via
interviews and focus groups whether and how RTBT affects experiences, is consistent with patient preferences
in their clinical encounters, and the factors associated with positive and negative experiences. This project will
produce evidence on the policy impact of an RTBT on access and quality of care for Black, Hispanic, Latino,
and rural patients with chronic conditions and on health disparities, and on implementation strategies to
maximize impact."
10873275,"Abstract:
Morbidity and mortality associated with ozone (O3) exposures are a substantial public health concern. Unlike
other environmental exposures, O3-related morbidity and mortality, is largely linked to respiratory causes and
associated with pre-existing respiratory conditions. However, specific mechanisms underlying this phenomenon
are poorly understood. Understanding how prior lung injury drives susceptibility to subsequent O3 exposure is
particularly important in the context on viral lung injury, such as pneumonia caused by seasonal influenza virus
or SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our overall hypothesis is that this is
driven by distinct alveolar macrophage (AMØ) subsets. During the past decade, work from several groups,
including ours, has demonstrated that long-living, self-maintaining, tissue-resident AMØ are the dominant
immune cell type in normal mouse and human lung. Tissue-resident AMØ are essential to lung homeostasis and
direct responses to pathogens and environmental exposures, including O3. We have previously reported that
murine O3 exposure expands tissue-resident AMØ, and their loss exacerbates O3-induced lung injury.
Conversely, monocyte-derived AMØ, recruited during lung injury (e.g. viral infection), augment inflammation. Our
group previously showed that monocyte-derived AMØ recruited after lung injury persist in the lung via autocrine
M-CSF/M-CSF receptor (M-CSF-R), maintain an activated phenotype, and drive chronic lung diseases.
Extending this to humans, we demonstrate that the abundance and activation state of monocyte-derived AMØs
negatively correlate with pulmonary function in patients with early pulmonary fibrosis. Cumulatively, our
published and preliminary data support that distinct AMØ subsets direct the balance between ongoing
inflammation and its resolution and suggest that AMØ composition, particularly the baseline presence and
activation of monocyte-derived AMØ, prior to exposure can enhance severity and persistence of O3-induced lung
injury. This baseline condition is particularly important as respiratory viral infections, including influenza and
SARS-CoV2, induce the recruitment of monocyte-derived AMØs. Leveraging mechanistic mouse models, state-
of-the-art lineage-tracing systems, single-cell genomics, and serial sampling in controlled human O3 exposures,
we will test the hypothesis that the abundance and activation state of monocyte-derived AMØs drive O3-
induced lung inflammatory responses via autocrine M-CSF/M-CSF-R signaling. Our specific aims are: Aim
1: To determine the role of autocrine monocyte-derived alveolar macrophage M-CSF/M-CSF-R signaling in
maintaining lung inflammation in mouse models of O3-exposure. Aim 2: To determine whether the abundance
and activation status of monocyte-derived AMØ predicts lung physiological and inflammatory responses in
controlled acute O3 exposures in normal human subjects and in individuals with prior SARS-CoV2 infection.
These results would support a novel translational paradigm with important public health implications, and identify
a novel therapeutic strategy to revert the adverse public health effects of O3 exposure."

the K01 award period include writing systematic reviews of the literature (i.e., manuscript on social network
approaches for youth), examination of K01 mentors' secondary datasets (e.g., manuscripts on adult social
identity mapping data and on emerging adult social network composition), and conducting the K01 research
study (e.g., manuscripts on methods for adapting the SIM approach, qualitative findings from the focus groups,
trajectories of social network and identity transitions among youth with AUDs, influence of social network,
social identity, and recovery capital on alcohol use outcomes). Findings from the research activities will be
disseminated in eight manuscripts submitted to peer-review journals and at relevant conferences. The K01

10894100,"Project Summary
The 2011 Medicare establishment of the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) is a great and underused opportunity to
respond to the National Cancer Institute’s calls for multilevel interventions that address both the supply and
demand for vastly underutilized preventive health services. Fewer than half of adults aged 65 and older are up-
to-date on cancer screenings and vaccinations recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task
Force (USPSTF), CDC, and Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and at the same time
many non-evidence-based services are delivered. Those at greatest risk for receiving poor preventive care
include racial / ethnic minorities and low income Americans. The free-to-the-patient AWV visit gives providers
dedicated time to focus on preventive health services.
We have developed a promising multilevel intervention to increase AWV use. This proposal’s goal is to refine
and implement a novel AWV Practice Redesign Toolkit to stimulate AWV visit use in small and mid-size
primary care practices, and to evaluate its effects on increasing delivery rates of evidence-based preventive
services and reducing rates of services not supported by scientific evidence. This multilevel practice redesign
intervention addresses the complexities of increasing AWVs at patient (demand for services), provider (supply
of services), and practice levels. It also uses electronic health record (EHR)-generated information and tools to
inform providers and patients about the preventive health services needed by individual patients. The R61
study aims are to: 1) demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining access to a mid-size practice’s EHR system to
create a population-based registry of patients in need of AWVs and preventive health services, and to notify
providers and patients of the need for these services; and 2) refine, pilot-test and demonstrate the feasibility of
implementing the AWV Practice Redesign Toolkit intervention in a mid-size practice. R61 results will inform
additional intervention refinements which will be implemented in the R33 phase. The R33 study aims are to
implement the AWV Practice Redesign Toolkit intervention in geographically and racially/ethnically diverse
practices, and to conduct a pragmatic trial to evaluate the effect of: intervention uptake on use of AWVs,
physician ordering of preventive health services, and use and overuse of preventive health services. Practices
will belong to unique nationwide practice networks - the DARTNet Institute (an electronic research network and
health data coordinating center) and the American Academy of Family Physicians National Research Network
(the largest practice-based research network in the United States, consisting of mostly small and mid-size
primary care practices which typically are under-represented in research). Implemented via video conferencing
and remote deployment of EHR tools, this low-cost intervention could be easily disseminated to small and solo
practices across the country. The anticipated increase in patient use of preventive health services will improve
population health and lower mortality, particularly in at-risk racial/ethnic minority patients."

The proposed Consortium of Food Allergy Research Clinical Research Center: Cincinnati Children's Hospital
Medical Center (CoFAR-CRC:CCHMC) aims to bring the experience, expertise, and scientific productivity and
the diverse patient populations of CCHMC to CoFAR. The patient population seen in the clinics and
participating in the research of the Division of Allergy and Immunology at CCHMC encompass varied
presentations and classifications of food allergy, including IgE-mediated food allergy (IgE-FA), eosinophilic
esophagitis (EoE), and food protein–induced enterocolitis (FPIES). The CoFAR CRC:CCHMC approach to
research is multipronged and self-sustaining by attracting patients with excellent care and creating and
maintaining databases and registries supported by biospecimen collection and biobanking. Those are utilized
in conducting mechanistic research that forms the basis of discoveries and clinical trials and advances
knowledge that improves patient care and attracts more patients. The description of the CoFAR CRC:CCHMC
will provide a) data on the capacity and readiness of the CRC; b) solid structure and wide range of services
available; c) recruitment abilities from the CRC databases and the community, specifically of difficult-to-recruit
populations, including minorities, infants, and adults; d) track record of initiation and successful and regulatory-
compliant execution of collaborative, multi-center clinical trials; e) support of professional development of
faculty and staff; and f) development and inclusion of junior faculty. We propose a network-wide, multicenter
clinical trial focused on maintaining acquired tolerance to food allergens and a center-specific research project
focused on defining the mechanism by which environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of food
allergies. For our potential network-wide clinical trial, we hypothesize that the gradual lengthening of the dosing
intervals in oral immunotherapy (OIT) in a similar pattern as in allergen immunotherapy protocols or cluster
dosing (4 days consecutive dosing + 3-day dosing holiday weekly) will maintain OIT-acquired tolerance as well
as daily dosing while providing a more manageable and acceptable dosing schedule for patients and their
families. We will conduct a prospective, open, 3-arm, non-inferiority trial of peanut OIT in children 3–8 years of
age; the primary outcome is passing an end-of-study (24 months) oral challenge to a serving size of peanut
protein. Mechanistic studies of changes in B cell receptors and basophil activation will explore novel
biomarkers for assessing long-term tolerance. For our center-specific project, we hypothesize that EoE and
IgE-FA are driven by environmental exposures that abrogate the aryl hydrocarbon (AHR) pathway; we propose
to investigate the mechanism of AHR function, therapeutic potential of esophageal delivery of AHR ligand-
producing bacteria, and metabolic composition of AHR ligands in food allergies, intersecting the AHR ligand
composition with cellular and molecular profiles of the epithelium and atopic manifestations."

The primary goal of this training program entitled “Research Training in Physiological Adaptations
to Stress” (PAS) is to provide a new generation of future scientists with authentic interdisciplinary
training and educational experiences that emphasize a translational approach to understanding the
physiological mechanisms which mediate organismal stress adaptation. Key aspects of the new
PAS program include using the One Health interdisciplinary public health framework as a lens for
solving human health and disease problems, better integration of entrepreneurial principles to
develop a discovery mindset, and applying with fidelity principles of rigor and reproducibility.
Familiarity with opportunities and challenges posed by generative artificial intelligence is another
key innovation, which we view as a training imperative to prepare our trainees for the 21st century
workforce. Value added training in entrepreneurship using a boot camp approach, and team
process through the Penn State MBA program will facilitate discovery. Graduate students presently
encounter little formal training in regulatory science, and the inter-disciplinary curriculum we
propose will better prepare our students for emerging academic and nonacademic biomedical
careers. An understanding of the business, legal and regulatory issues which shape key milestones
in the biomedical science pathway, and the ability to work in diverse teams will allow our trainees
to be leaders of innovation. Here, rigorous research design and core competencies necessary for
effective communication are also emphasized. The training program takes advantage of existing
faculty biomedical expertise in four academic colleges who have amassed an impressive training
record while maintaining research excellence, with an overall time to the PhD of 5 years with little
attrition. We propose selection of 5 students per year for a period of two years (total of 24 trainees).
Additional institutional matching funds will allow for the training of 7.5 additional trainees. The
institutional commitment to our training program is outstanding. A foundational course entitled
“Physiological Adaptations to Stress” has been designed specifically for the training program, and
will serve as a capstone experience to emphasize program goals using multiple levels of scientific
inquiry (cells to human). Defining a new conceptual framework for hypothesis-driven research to
inform mechanisms of stress adaptation within a rich academic environment with dedicated
mentoring, strong research support and institutional commitment is proposed. We envision trainees
will continue to participate in program activities at the conclusion of their tenure as a T32 Fellow."
10863760,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goal of this line of research is to improve physical therapy for fall prevention in people with
Parkinson’s disease (PD). Falls place an enormous burden on people with PD, leading to injury, isolation, and
often, death. Physical therapy can improve balance; however, its effect on falls is often limited. Barriers to
developing effective rehabilitative approaches include a lack of knowledge regarding 1) which specific aspects
of balance should be targeted to reduce falls in this group, and 2) how neural deficits contribute to altered
balance. For example, therapists are aware that reactive stepping (i.e., the quick steps to regain balance after a
loss of balance) are related to falls. However, there is limited evidence directly relating reactive stepping
responses to falls in people with PD, and no evidence regarding which aspects of stepping (e.g., size, speed,
latency) should be targeted during therapy to have the greatest impact on falls. Similarly, while there is some
evidence that standing balance (i.e., sway) relates to falls, the specific aspects of sway (e.g., area, relation to
base of support) most related to falls in people with PD are unclear. Finally, the brain changes that lead to altered
sway and reactive balance deficits in people with PD are poorly understood. These gaps impede our ability to
deliver effective fall-prevention interventions and develop targeted neurostimulation protocols to improve balance
in people with PD. This project will identify the specific aspects of reactive and standing balance that are related
to prospectively measured falls, as well as the brain regions that contribute to altered balance. These data are
necessary to design effective clinical trials to test rehabilitation approaches for fall reduction.
The goals of this project will be achieved by assessing reactive & standing balance, as well as neuroimaging
outcomes in 100 people with PD at risk for falls. We will then follow these individuals for 12 months to
prospectively track falls. Aim 1 will assess the individual relationship between 1) reactive and 2) standing balance
to prospectively assessed falls. Balance outcomes will be collected under dual-task conditions, given that falls
often occur when attention is divided. Aim 2 will assess the relative and cumulative importance of reactive and
standing balance for fall prediction in 1 model. To facilitate a better understanding of the PD-specific
pathophysiology leading to poor balance in people with PD, exploratory Aim 3 will identify the neural correlates
of poor reactive and standing balance in this cohort.
This work is a critical step in understanding and treating balance deficits & falls in people with PD; addressing
the question: “Which aspects of balance should clinicians target for fall-prevention therapy in people with PD?”
Data will provide information to clinicians regarding rehabilitative targets for fall-prevention balance interventions,
as well as a deeper understanding of the neural signatures of balance deficits in people with PD."

This career development award proposal describes a research and training plan that will provide Dr. Katherine
McDermott with the resources needed to establish a career as an independent clinical scientist developing and
testing scalable interventions for the treatment of chronic pain. Background: Chronic musculoskeletal pain is
one of the leading causes of disability, with millions of individuals suffering from its effects. Pain catastrophizing
is a key predictor of pain interference and is characterized by magnification of the intensity of pain, rumination,
and feelings of helplessness to cope. While some interventions target pain catastrophizing, they offer modest
effects and require extensive resources due to reliance on clinician involvement. Self-directed interventions that
parsimoniously and effectively target pain catastrophizing are needed. Specific aims and research design: This
project will involve the development, refinement, and preliminary evaluation of Pain Disengagement Training
(PDT), a self-directed intervention for pain catastrophizing. The aims of this project are 1) To develop PDT using
qualitative focus groups to solicit patient input on intervention components and protocol considerations (N=4
groups, ~20 participants); 2) To refine PDT using an open pilot (N=10) with pre/post intervention self-report
assessments and qualitative exit interviews to obtain feedback on the intervention experience and procedures; and
3) To evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and credibility of PDT in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N=50)
of PDT vs. Healthy Writing Control (HWC). Results will inform a multi-site feasibility RCT R01 submission.
Training and mentoring: Three primary training aims will be accomplished in the present proposal to fill key
gaps in the candidate’s training: 1) Qualitative and mixed methods, including the design of focus group procedures
and qualitative and mixed methods data analysis; 2) Chronic pain intervention development and refinement,
including developing protocols to optimize intervention acceptability and feasibility in a pain patient sample; and
3) Management of rigorous randomized clinical trials, including establishing standard operating procedures to
maximize fidelity and retention. This training will be provided by a team of expert mentors including Dr. Ana-
Maria Vranceanu, Dr. Francis Keefe, and Dr. Mark Lumley, who have a wealth of experience designing and
evaluating interventions for chronic pain. Additional training will be provided by advisors (Drs. Parker and
Yousif), didactics, scientific publications, and experiential training, including manuscript writing. Relevance to
NCCIH: This study is well-aligned with NCCIH’s focus on Whole Health research and support of impactful
clinical trials of complementary and integrative health approaches, including the advancement of the
complementary and integrative management of pain. Impact: The proposed project and training plan will provide
the candidate with the training needed to transition to independence as an intervention researcher committed to
creating scalable treatments to address the key predictors of chronic pain interference."
10864406,"Although it is recognized that systemic maternal immune responses influence the fetus, how local decidual and
placental inflammation, in the absence of an infectious agent, impacts the developing fetal immune system is
not understood. Developing a deeper understanding of decidual/placental inflammation will provide opportunities
for the development of targeted therapeutics either in utero or once offspring are born. Thus, the long-term goals
of this project are to understand how the in utero environment impacts the developing fetal immune system, and
to assess the long-term immunological consequences. The central hypothesis is that sterile inflammation at
the maternal-fetal interface (MFI) leads to skewing of the fetal immune system towards a pro-
inflammatory phenotype. To understand how sterile inflammation affects the fetal immune system, Tisseel, a
binary product where fibrinogen and thrombin are co-delivered to create rapid clotting, will be injected to the MFI
of pregnant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), resulting in clotting and placental infarct development, leading
to necrosis and inflammation.
Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that Tisseel injection into the MFI leads to sterile inflammation of
the decidua and placenta. Tisseel or sterile saline will be injected into the MFI in the late second trimester/early
third trimester (~GD90) of pregnant rhesus macaques. At ~GD155, the placenta and fetus will be obtained and
weighed, and the fetus will be euthanized. MFI tissues will be processed for histopathology, molecular and
immunological analyses, including spectral flow cytometry, scRNA-seq and Spatial Transcriptomics.
Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that Tisseel injection into the MFI leads to fetal immune system
programming towards a proinflammatory phenotype. At experimental delivery, the fetus will be euthanized,
fetal tissues will be collected and mononuclear cell (MC) suspensions prepared. MCs will be analyzed for gene
expression (scRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq).
Overall, the proposed project will address how sterile inflammation at the MFI impacts the developing immune
system. Because the fetal immune system is pliable, it makes this developmental stage an attractive opportunity
for targeted therapeutics that could prevent long-term health consequences. Completion of this K01 proposal
will also allow me to gain training in the development and use of experimental NHP models of pregnancy
complications, skills in advanced data analysis, and understanding of the fetal immune system. This will facilitate
my transition into an independent investigator in maternal-fetal health."

While the last 15 years have brought remarkable clinical advances in melanoma therapy, the current standard-
of-care targeted and immune therapies have hit a ‘ceiling’ that must be overcome to further improve patient
outcomes. The identification of novel targets holds tremendous promise to devise strategies to add to our clinical
armamentarium of melanoma therapies. Cancer cells adapt their metabolism to meet the metabolic requirements
of sustained proliferation, interaction with the tumor microenvironment, and outgrowth at disseminated secondary
sites. Metabolic enzymes with key roles in cancer cells are envisioned as actionable vulnerabilities. One such
enzyme is the phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), which mediates the first and rate-limiting step in the
Serine synthesis pathway. PHGDH plays an important role in melanoma formation and metastasis. Interestingly,
combining PHGDH inhibition with extracellular Serine starvation is detrimental to colon cancer cells, suggesting
that limiting Serine availability may be a strategy to target cancer cells. However, current PHGDH inhibitors are
not suitable for clinical use and may also cause systemic toxicities. Thus, alternative approaches to limit Serine
availability to target melanoma cells need to be devised. We discovered that oncogenic BRAFV600E signaling
stimulates PHGDH expression and MAPK pathway inhibition diminishes baseline and Serine starvation-induced
PHGDH levels in melanoma. Preliminary in vitro analyses showed that combining a BRAFV600E inhibitor with
extracellular Serine starvation induced melanoma cell death. We therefore hypothesize that reducing PHGDH
expression by inhibiting BRAFV600E synergizes with dietary Serine restriction to reduce melanoma growth. In this
proposal, we will first use genetic approaches to test if PHGDH depletion in established melanomas will affect
tumor growth in vivo in the absence or presence of dietary Serine restriction. Additionally, we will evaluate the
therapeutic potential of combining dietary Serine restriction with different small molecule inhibitors targeting the
BRAF/MAPK/mTOR axis, some of which are FDA-approved. Our study will preclinically assess the therapeutic
potential of a new treatment strategy of melanoma that could be rapidly translated into the clinic."

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research has transformed our understanding of human brain
function and disease and is flourishing under unprecedented international funding, including dedicated support
from the BRAIN Initiative. However, recent work has exposed an endemic lack of statistical power (i.e., ability to
detect effects of interest) in typical fMRI studies, leading to findings that do not replicate or uncover only a small
tip of the iceberg of true effects. This arises in large part because performing proper power analyses to guide
fMRI study design is not straightforward. First, it is difficult to estimate expected effects based on the literature,
and study sample sizes are already so small that even smaller pilot data may not yield helpful estimates.
Furthermore, fMRI data and inferential algorithms are complex, yet existing fMRI power analysis tools rely on
relatively limited simulations, parametric estimates, and omit the most popular inferential procedures. As a result,
fMRI researchers often perform misleading power analyses or avoid power analyses altogether, missing a critical
opportunity to optimally design studies to detect desired effects. To address this gap, we will create a power
analysis algorithm and tool tailored for standard fMRI studies that leverages: 1) large existing datasets to define
typical study effects, and 2) recently developed methods for benchmarking power of complex inferential
procedures. Finally, it will be designed to provide tailored recommendations and be easy to use, thus promoting
its utility to everyday researchers. In Aim 1 (K99), we will create database of effect size maps for typical study
designs using large, publicly available datasets and build a web app for exploring these maps. We will use this
database in Aim 2 (R00) to design a post hoc power calculator algorithm to estimate power for typical study
designs. Aim 3 (R00) will refine this algorithm by creating a meta-regression model that incorporates additional
study and participant factors to provide a more tailored estimate of power for an individual researcher. Finally, in
Aim 4 (R00) we will create and disseminate an easy-to use web-based tool for performing the “tailored” power
analysis, notably only requiring the user to specify information readily available to them. This proposal will result
in the first algorithm and tool to perform an empirical power analysis for fMRI study planning, with a potential
user base that includes all researchers planning an fMRI study using typical designs. This will enable researchers
to more easily and accurately plan well-powered studies, thus promoting more robust and reproducible findings
in the field. Furthermore, this proposal will provide training in production-ready web development, study
aggregation methods, and independence-oriented professional competencies, which will facilitate my transition
to an independent research career leading statistical methodology development in fMRI."
10866144,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Peanut allergy affects one in fifty children in the US with disparities in prevalence and morbidity. There is no
cure, and while progress is being made in treatment, the standard of care is peanut avoidance and ready
access to injectable epinephrine which can adversely impact quality of life. Based on solid evidence in the last
decade that early peanut exposure reduces allergy risk, current guidelines recommend screening (with allergy
referral or serum IgE level) followed by early peanut introduction, around age 4-6 months in infants considered
high-risk for peanut allergy, specifically those with severe eczema or egg allergy. However, barriers at the
caregiver, pediatrician and allergist levels have challenged the implementation of these guidelines. In response
to these challenges, our colleagues developed and evaluated the Intervention to Reduce Early (Peanut)
Allergy in Children (iREACH), a decision support tool integrated into the electronic health record (EHR), in a
multi-site cluster randomized trial. Compared with usual care, iREACH led to a 2-fold increase in pediatrician
guideline-concordant care among high-risk infants with severe eczema or egg allergy. Evidence supports that
the timing of peanut introduction in infancy is crucial, with the most substantial protective effect for introduction
prior to 6-7 months. Some guidelines recommend peanut introduction in high-risk infants without screening, in
part due to concern that screening, which can necessitate a visit to an allergist, may delay introduction.
However, determinants of delays in this population have yet to be well characterized. To facilitate timely peanut
introduction in high-risk infants, it is critical to understand determinants of screening and management.
In the proposed study and using iREACH data, we will explore multi-level sociodemographic determinants of
peanut introduction in high-risk infants (Aim 1). Then, using sequential mixed methods, we will further examine
facilitators of and barriers to guideline adherence (Aim 2). This information will inform a pilot intervention in an
urban Federally Qualified Health Center, utilizing virtual medical visits to facilitate peanut introduction by 6-12
months of age in infants at high-risk (Aim 3). The results of this study will lay the groundwork for a future multi-
site trial to facilitate timely, guideline-concordant care among infants at high-risk. They will provide insight to
help address other delays in care in communities with inequitable access and disease burden.
We have assembled a team of experts in the field of implementation science and health services research,
qualitative and mixed methods, intervention development, pragmatic trial design, maternal-child nutrition,
health equity, and telemedicine to support the project aims and training goals. We will leverage data from a
large multisite trial. The PI, Julie Flom, MD MPH, is a Pediatrician and Allergist/Immunologist with experience
in epidemiology and a current K12 in implementation science. The advanced training proposed in this K23 will
prepare her for a successful transition into an independent investigator focused on adaptation, evaluation, and
equitable implementation of interventions for food allergy and asthma."
10866206,"ABSTRACT
Latinas have the highest cervical cancer incidence rates compared to other racial and ethnic groups, and
disparities are greater among low-income and non-US-born Latinas. Routine cervical cancer screening and
timely follow-up of abnormal results are key to reducing cervical cancer mortality, especially among low-income
and non-US-born Latina patients in safety-net healthcare settings. Higher social capital (resources rooted in
social networks), which can be measured at the individual and community level, is positively associated with
cervical cancer screening among Latinas, but how this association operates by nativity status and how clinic-
based social capital interventions can be implemented in safety-net settings to address cervical cancer
disparities among this population has not been explored. The goal of this mixed-methods study is to investigate
multilevel ways in which social capital supports cervical cancer screening rates and follow-up and identify
important considerations for a clinic-based social capital intervention to improve cervical cancer prevention
practices among Latinas. The proposed study will explore two aims in the mentored phase: (1) test the
association between social capital (measured at the individual and population level) and healthcare treatment
delay; and (2) investigate the processes in which social capital influences cervical cancer screening and follow-
up among Latina patients and identify strategies for intervention design and implementation. In the R00 phase,
I will: (1) use Delphi method in a clinic-community engaged process to establish consensus on important
considerations of a clinic-based social capital intervention for Latina patients; and (2) develop and pilot test the
feasibility and acceptability of a social capital intervention in a safety-net clinic. The unique strengths of this
proposal include a) its focus on understanding of multilevel social capital and the established association using
national All of Us data; b) a unique focus is studying differences between U.S.- and non-US-born Latinas; and c)
using a multisectoral approach to better understand community (i.e., stakeholders) and clinic (i.e., patients,
providers, clinic staff) perspectives to inform an intervention aimed at increasing social capital that support
cervical cancer screening and follow-up. Finally, I will benefit from a strong team of mentors and scientific
advisory committee with specialties in health services research, health disparities, Latino health, multilevel
research design, implementation science, community research, cancer epidemiology, biostatistics, and social
capital. The proposed study is innovative in its plan to understand how social capital can improve cervical cancer
screening and follow-up among U.S.-born and non-US-born Latinas to reduce cervical cancer disparities. Results
of this study will provide preliminary data for a R01 application using a randomized controlled trial to test the
selected intervention among Latina patients in safety-net settings."
10871699,"An Investigation of Mental, Physical, and Sleep Health: The Role of Social Determinants
Summary
Sleep deficiency is an important public health concern and is known to significantly impact
mental and physical health. Sleep deficiency is an essential risk factor and marker for
chronic conditions that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minority populations and further contribute to health
disparities. Social determinants of health are considered a system of schemes providing an understanding of how health
is socially patterned, investigating causal pathways between social conditions and human health and disease.
Noticeably, sleep deficiencies seem to share similar determinants and causal pathways observed for health outcomes
with well-known health disparities. Limited studies have investigated whether social-environmental mechanisms and
pathways that result in health disparities for mental and physical health outcomes can explain sleep deficiencies. This
study will investigate the relative contribution of social-environmental factors at the individual (e.g., biological
vulnerability to elevated blood pressure), interpersonal (e.g., city stress), community (e.g., neighborhood
characteristics), and societal (e.g., societal structure, discrimination) levels and their influence as mechanisms to
understand sleep deficiencies impact on mental and physical health, thus enabling us to substantiate key drivers of
health disparities for racial/ethnic minorities. An understanding of the critical role of sleep deficiencies at the interplay
of upstream social-environmental influences and downstream mental and physical health outcomes will be instrumental
in moving the field toward a more useful integration of behavioral, biological, physiological, and socio-environmental
understanding, which may lead to culturally tailored interventions to reduce the societal burden of health disparities."
10880681,"Dr. Curtis seeks to become an independently funded investigator in sickle cell disease
with a focus on the understanding and treatment of chronic pain. Chronic pain is a critical issue
for people with sickle cell disease (SCD). This pain is primarily treated with opioids, but for
many people with SCD opioids are inadequate to treat chronic pain alone. Cannabinoids (the
primary active agents in marijuana) have been shown to be effective for chronic and
neuropathic pain and reduce inflammation in non-SCD diseases. Inflammation in SCD is not
only correlated with pain but is also correlated with high rates of end organ damage. Over one
third of people with SCD say they use cannabis for pain relief, but there is currently no evidence
to support this use. Further, there is no evidence to suggest what the adverse effects of this
use might be for people with SCD. There are no guidelines for what doctors should tell patients
with SCD who ask if cannabis products might help their pain.
 This proposal seeks to address this gap with a placebo-controlled, double-masked, 8
week-long study of dronabinol, an FDA approval oral agent which contains tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC), the primary active ingredient in cannabis. The aims of this study are 1: To determine
whether dronabinol will improve pain and QOL in adults with SCD and chronic pain, 2: To
assess dronabinol's effect on markers of inflammation in patients with SCD compared to
placebo, And 3: To determine the safety and tolerability of dronabinol use in adults with SCD
compared to placebo. If dronabinol is found to improve chronic pain, or quality of life, or to
reduce markers of inflammation, it should studied in a larger trial. Understanding the safety and
tolerability of dronabinol will guide not only future studies but will help clinicians and patients
understand some of the possible risks of cannabis use.
 Through this career development award Dr. Curtis will gain expertise in clinical trial
design and execution, longitudinal data analysis and advanced modelling techniques, and
clinical and translational aspects of the study of chronic pain. Her advisory committee consists
of experts in clinical trial development, pain in SCD, inflammation in SCD, and statistics.
Through working with a multidisciplinary mentorship team, the proposed research project, and
formal coursework, Dr. Curtis will be able to become an independent clinical investigator with
expertise in chronic pain treatment in sickle cell disease."
10880682,"Cannabis use, heavy cannabis use, and cannabis-related problems are becoming increasingly common in the
United States. Among those who use cannabis regularly, significant insomnia is common. For example, our
data from 800 patients seeking medical cannabis indicate that insomnia is a chief comorbidity, with 80% of
participants reporting that they regularly use cannabis to manage symptoms of insomnia. In addition, sleep
problems are often a barrier to reducing cannabis use among those with Cannabis Use Disorders. Cognitive
Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (CBTi) is highly effective in individuals with insomnia comorbid with other
health conditions, including those with heavy and/or problematic use of substances; although it has not been
fully tested in those with problematic cannabis use. In a recently-completed National Institute on Drug Abuse
R34 randomized controlled pilot trial, our group found that, compared to a telemedicine-delivered Sleep
Hygiene Education (SHE-TM) condition, a tailored telemedicine-delivered CBTi (CBTi-CB-TM) improved
insomnia and daytime functioning and reduced cannabis use more during short-term follow-up among non-
treatment-seeking adults using cannabis for sleep. In addition to important clinical questions related to the
treatment of insomnia in those who use cannabis, the specific mechanisms linking heavy cannabis use and
insomnia are poorly understood. We propose to evaluate whether a fundamental sleep regulatory system –
homeostatic sleep drive – is dysregulated in subjects with problematic cannabis use and whether changes in
this mechanism are associated with clinical outcomes. Thus, the aims of the proposed study are to recruit a
sample of 200 adults with problematic cannabis use and insomnia to evaluate (1) the efficacy of CBTi-CB-TM
vs. SHE-TM for sleep, cannabis use, and associated daytime symptoms and (2) the effects of CBTi-CB-TM on
the homeostatic sleep system and its association with clinical outcomes. Building on the success of the recent
R34, the proposed study will examine the longer-term outcomes associated with randomization to CBTi-CB-TM
and utilize state-of-the-art measures of sleep homeostasis to examine the factors underlying the links between
cannabis use, contents of the intervention, and objective sleep outcomes. These findings have important
implications for understanding the relationship between cannabis use and sleep, as well as for identifying
strategies to help improve outcomes in the large and growing group of individuals who report problematic
cannabis use and sleep problems."

American Indians (AIs) are disproportionately impacted by the current opioid epidemic. AIs experience an 88%
higher prevalence of OUDs (1.5%) than the US general population (0.8%), and AIs are second only to non-Latinx
whites in their experience of opioid overdose deaths (13.9 and 17.5 per 100,000, respectively). Fortunately,
medication-assisted treatment (MAT; e.g., buprenorphine + naloxone) is highly effective for reducing opioid-
related harm, including overdose, making it the gold-standard OUD treatment approach. A recent systematic
review, however, showed a median retention of 56% at the NIDA-recommended 12-month treatment length.
Further, most AIs with OUD do not attend traditional substance-use treatment (62%). This is concerning because
treatment retention is strongly associated with mortality rate reduction. Although no studies have documented
OUD treatment outcomes specific to AIs, research in Native communities has generally highlighted concerns
about the cultural acceptability of the highly directive, Western medical substance-use treatment approaches
(e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, 12-step programming) that are widely available. Further, previous research
has indicated that AIs with substance use disorders want greater representation of Native staff and better
integration of culturally adapted approaches in the services they receive. Culturally adapted approaches to
treatment are associated with reductions in use and associated problems. However, there are currently no
evidence-based, culturally adapted counseling approaches for AIs addressing MAT retention and opioid-related
harm. Accordingly, we propose a 2-phase R61/R33 development and evaluation project in response to RFA-DA-
19-013 - “Responding to Opioid Use Disorders (OUD) in Tribal Communities in the Context of SAMHSA and
CDC Funding.” This project will leverage recent federal OUD treatment initiative funding (SAMHSA TI-18-016,
CDC-RFA-OT18-18030101supp) as a platform for culturally adapting substance-use counseling focused on
improving MAT retention and reducing opioid-related harm within the Cherokee Nation Health System (CNHS).
The 2-year R61 Phase will entail 2 parts. First, we will conduct a mixed methods inquiry to inform research
methods and the community-specific, cultural adaptation of an existing, efficacious, harm-reduction counseling
approach. Second, we will manualize and pilot the resulting Counseling for Harm Reduction and Retention in
MAT at Cherokee Nation (CHaRRM-CN) together with a community advisory board comprising CNHS providers,
staff, and patients as well as researchers from Cherokee Nation, Washington State University, and the University
of Washington. The subsequent, 3-year R33 Phase will entail a 2-arm RCT (N=160) conducted within CNHS
testing the efficacy of CHaRRM-CN in improving 6-month MAT retention, reducing substance-related harm and
illicit opioid use, and increasing Native enculturation compared to a services-as-usual control condition (i.e.,
cognitive behavioral treatment)."

CDC Funding.” This project will leverage recent federal OUD treatment initiative funding (SAMHSA TI-18-016,
CDC-RFA-OT18-18030101supp) as a platform for culturally adapting substance-use counseling focused on
improving MAT retention and reducing opioid-related harm within the Cherokee Nation Health System (CNHS).
The 2-year R61 Phase will entail 2 parts. First, we will conduct a mixed methods inquiry to inform research
methods and the community-specific, cultural adaptation of an existing, efficacious, harm-reduction counseling
approach. Second, we will manualize and pilot the resulting Counseling for Harm Reduction and Retention in
MAT at Cherokee Nation (CHaRRM-CN) together with a community advisory board comprising CNHS providers,
staff, and patients as well as researchers from Cherokee Nation, Washington State University, and the University
of Washington. The subsequent, 3-year R33 Phase will entail a 2-arm RCT (N=160) conducted within CNHS
testing the efficacy of CHaRRM-CN in improving 6-month MAT retention, reducing substance-related harm and
illicit opioid use, and increasing Native enculturation compared to a services-as-usual control condition (i.e.,
cognitive behavioral treatment)."
10878130,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The proper evaluation of public policies on health and other outcomes is vital for determining whether a
policy was effective and also whether it should be continued or implemented in other regions. For example,
Philadelphia, along with six other U.S. cities, has implemented excise taxes on sweetened beverages with the goal
of decreasing consumption of added sugars which have been associated with obesity and other serious health
conditions. However, what if consumers try to avoid the tax by purchasing beverages in neighboring regions that
did not implement the tax? Consumers may also be encouraged by the higher price of sweetened beverages
to purchase other high-sugar snacks and drinks rather than purchase the taxed beverages. Without properly
understanding and accounting for these complex but common situations (called interference), researchers may
grossly overestimate the health impact of public policies. Further, policy evaluations often rely on survey data
for more granular insights on the causal mechanisms of a policy, like individual-level changes in consumption.
However, these data may not represent populations of interest, such as those that are underserved. To address
these challenges we propose new causal estimands, specify unique identification assumptions, construct doubly
robust semi-parametric estimators, and apply them to multiple studies of the Philadelphia beverage tax.
 This proposal addresses critical gaps in the evaluation of public policies. Our work is organized under the
following aims: Aim 1 will develop innovative causal methods to estimate heterogeneous policy effects under
diverse direct and indirect (e.g., spillover) exposures and generalize and transport these heterogeneous policy
effects to settings with different exposure, sociodemographic, and geographic contexts. Aim 2 will develop novel
causal methods to examine substitution effects using a potential outcomes framework under a set of newly estab-
lished identification conditions. Aim 3 will develop a novel synthetic control approach that allows the assessment
of individual-level outcomes obtained via surveys. The first two aims will apply these new methods to evaluate the
effects of the Philadelphia beverage tax on purchasing behaviors using volume sales data and transport these
effects to other U.S. cities. Here, we will also estimate beverage tax effects in regions that implemented similar
taxes (e.g., San Francisco, CA; Seattle, WA) to assess effect generalizability. The third aim will analyze the effect
of the tax on consumption and obesity outcomes using data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System.
User-friendly software will be produced and made publicly available for all proposed methods. This project will
provide robust and flexible tools for policymakers to evaluate, transport, and generalize public policies under
complex real-world settings."

Antibiotic treatment failure is one of the greatest global public health challenges of our generation. Antimicrobial-
resistant bacteria directly account for over 1.2 million deaths annually worldwide. Microorganisms that are
refractory to a new antibiotic often emerge shortly after the drug is introduced in the clinic. Besides becoming
heritably resistant to antibiotics, some bacteria in clonal cultures—coined persisters—can reversibly reprogram
their phenotypes and become transiently tolerant to a given drug. This can lead to infection relapse after a course
of antibiotics, rendering the treatment ineffective. Evidence further suggests that persisters have a higher
likelihood of acquiring resistance-conferring mutations. As such, the development of anti-persistence/resistance
therapeutic strategies can increase the success of antimicrobial therapy.
In this proposal, we focus on antibiotic persistence and resistance development in Escherichia coli and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells in slow/non-growing cultures, which are less responsive to antibiotics and more
difficult to eradicate than their growing counterparts. We aim to discover strategies to potentiate the activity of
existing and new topoisomerase inhibitors against these gram-negative pathogens. We recently found that
metabolic stimulation and loss of efflux pump action during topoisomerase inhibitor treatment reduce persistence
and resistance in non-growing E. coli. To build upon these findings, we will execute the following aims:
Aim 1: Discover metabolites that are abundant at infection sites that can modulate persistence and resistance
development of E. coli and P. aeruginosa toward first-in-class non-fluoroquinolone topoisomerase inhibitors that
are in clinical trials.
Aim 2: Investigate the impact of metabolic stimulation and loss of efflux pump action on bacterial metabolism,
DNA integrity, and viability during topoisomerase inhibitor treatment.
Aim 3: Deduce the effects of metabolic stimulation and loss of efflux pump action during topoisomerase inhibitor
treatment on the coordination of molecular events that are important for persister repair and resuscitation after
topoisomerase treatment terminates.
We envision that the successful completion of this project will expand our knowledge of persister survival
strategies and vulnerabilities. This will enable us to develop methods to enhance the activities of existing
antibiotics and preserve the efficacy of new drugs in development before their introduction to the clinic."
10878517,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The recent approval of immunotherapies has revolutionized the approach to managing bladder cancer (BCa).
Nevertheless, complete response is observed in only a minority of patients and there are no unambiguous
biomarkers to guide treatment selection. A key factor that controls tumor growth and response to cancer immune
therapy is the recruitment of immune cells to the tumor microenvironment by chemokines.
The chemokine CCL2 (C-C motif ligand 2) is best known for its ability to induce the trafficking of immune cells
by binding its primary receptor, CCR2. The recruitment of immunosuppressive myeloid cells by CCL2 promotes
cancer in several tumor types. In the bladder, however, we show an unexpected finding that CCL2 and its
receptor CCR2 are protective against cancer development and growth and the mechanism is T cell-dependent.
We also show that post-translational nitration of CCL2 by bladder tumors inhibits CCL2’s ability to recruit T cells
and its effects on tumor control. This may be one of the critical reasons behind the failure of chemokines in
clinical trials and may explain certain paradoxes that are seen between CCL2 levels and patient outcomes in
cancer. We propose delineating the effect of CCL2 nitration on the biology of BCa by using nitration-resistant
recombinant CCL2 (rCCL2NR) which may restore bladder tumor T cell recruitment and facilitate anti-tumor T cell
immunity.
Based on convincing preliminary data, we hypothesize that nitration of CCL2 in BCa ablates the tumor protective
function of CCL2/CCR2 by disrupting T cell recruitment to bladder tumors. To address this hypothesis, two
specific aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we test the hypothesis that blocking nitration of CCL2 by rCCL2NR reduces
BCa progression by enhancing the recruitment of CCR2+ T cells in the bladder. rCCL2NR treatment effects will
be tested by intravesically instilling rCCL2NR vs rCCL2 vs control PBS weekly in the bladder. We will also
delineate the specific mechanisms by which rCCL2NR exerts its tumor-protective effect and test whether rCCL2NR
increases CCR2+ T cell recruitment or increase the activation and cytotoxicity of already recruited CCR2+ T cells
in the bladder. rCCL2NR will be evaluated either as a single agent or in combination with standard BCa treatment
strategies. Aim 2 will test whether nitrated CCL2 level in human bladder tumors is a prognostic factor and
predicts treatment response to immune therapy in BCa patients. Multiplex immunofluorescence will be used to
detect unmodified and nitrated CCL2 levels in BCa tissue microarray. We will also test whether intravesical
human rCCL2NR treatment results in increased recruitment of T cells in a humanized murine model of BCa. The
focus of this proposal is to develop an in-depth understanding of a novel cellular trafficking mechanism of immune
cells in the biology of BCa and the development of a breakthrough immunotherapy strategy that will potentially
improve the landscape of BCa treatment. Overall, the R01 award will provide indispensable support for a new
investigator to establish her independent line of BCa immunology research (ESI)."
10878520,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Aging induces changes in the visual system, including decreased visual acuity, contrast and wavelength
sensitivity, and processing of visual information. These changes are reflected in retinal pigment epithelium
(RPE), retina and the visual cortex. RPE plays important roles in maintenance of the light-sensitive
photoreceptors. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the major cause of blindness in the elderly,
initially affects the RPE and gradually leads to secondary loss of photoreceptors. One of the two forms of AMD
is the “dry” form, for which currently there is no effective treatment. Consequently, there is an unmet medical
need for understanding the disease mechanisms during aging and developing new therapies for AMD. There is
a higher prevalence for AMD in women compared to age-matched men, and there are sex-related differences in
the pathophysiology of AMD. Specifically, sex hormone deficiency and its duration are associated with the
development and progression of soft drusen in women but not in men. Gonadal hormones have been related to
retinal disorders, and macular hole is reported to be more common among women than men, particularly in
postmenopausal women. Despite these reports, the Royal College of Ophthalmologists guidelines indicate that
the higher prevalence of AMD in female sex is due to their longer life expectancy and that female sex is not a
risk factor for AMD. Thus, whether gonadal hormones or sex chromosomes are risk factors in age-related retinal
degeneration remain elusive.
To determine the role that sex plays in age-related visual decline, we propose to
use the four-core genotype (FCG) mice, which will allow us to test the roles of sex chromosome complement
(XX vs. XY), female and male hormone secretions, and the combined or interactive effects of these factors on
RPE and visual cortex aging. The results of the proposed studies will further our understanding of how aging,
sex chromosomes, and gonadal sex contribute to the visual system function during aging."
10878522,"Abstract
Successful host defense against bacterial pneumonia requires a highly regulated balance between the
activation of sufficient inflammation and oxidants to kill inhaled pathogens and an anti-inflammatory and anti-
oxidant response to protect the host from tissue damage. The ESKAPE pathogens including S. aureus, K.
pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa are multiply antibiotic resistant bacteria associated with substantial morbidity
and mortality in hospitalized patients as the cause of pneumonia and sepsis. These bacteria share a
remarkable ability to alter their own metabolism and that of the host to limit phagocytic clearance and enable
persistent infection. These pathogens robustly stimulate itaconate and fumarate production, among the most
abundant metabolites in the infected airway, both with many anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant consequences.
We will test the central hypothesis that itaconate and fumarate function in the orchestration of an effective
immune response to these airway pathogens, limiting host damage but at the expense of enabling persistent
infection. We will establish how itaconate is linked to the activation of the major anti-oxidant transcription
factors, Nrf2, Atf3 and their downstream effectors that may interfere with the clearance of S. aureus and P.
aeruginosa by limiting the oxidant tone in the infected airways, important for bacterial killing. We will establish
how itaconate and fumarate skew immune cell phenotypes, promoting the anti-inflammatory M2-like
macrophage and myeloid derived suppressor cell dominated responses. Both itaconate and fumarate are
actively involved in the post translational modification of host and pathogen targets. We will establish how
itaconation and succination of bacterial proteins such as the carbon catabolite repressors enhances the ability
of these pathogens to persist in the infected lung. Our overarching goal is to establish how immunometabolites
contribute to the pathogenesis of persistent airway infection, how different organisms may activate distinctive
responses, and to identify targets to enhance our ability to prevent and treat health care associated
pneumonias."
10878458,"Summary
 Conventional chemotherapy regimens induce complete remission in the majority of patients with acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) and results in >95% reduction in tumor burden. However, the persistence of minimal
or measurable residual disease (MRD) is considered to be a key determinant of relapse and poor patient
prognosis in AML. The current clinical strategy at complete remission with MRD positivity is, depending on the
level, to either provide additional dose(s) of the initial treatment or switch to a new therapy at the time of
relapse. Our long-term goal is to instead target MRD by selecting a more optimal therapy before relapse as
there are many advantages to treating patients with MRD-only disease rather than waiting for clinical relapse.
This would be a transformative clinical advance for patients with persistent MRD if selective targeting of MRD
either forestalled or completely obviated clinical relapse. We hypothesize that an optimal assay performed at
the time of complete remission would not only predict therapeutic response but also identify relevant
heterogeneity that is present within the patient’s MRD. We are proposing to achieve this assay by integrating
Deepcell’s high-content label-free brightfield imaging and AI powered sorting with MIT’s high precision
biophysical measurements and DFCI’s clinical resources and expertise. We expect to deliver a novel platform
to enable real-time functional assessment of AML MRD therapeutic vulnerabilities with meaningful clinical
impact. Furthermore, technical advances and experience gained here will facilitate future application of a
similar device to the MRD state in other cancers."
10878461,"The majority of recurrent ovarian cancers spread to the peritoneal cavity in the form of ascites, where tumor cells
grow as spheroids, and metastasize to other organs causing morbidity and death. The overall goal of this
proposal is to define the mechanisms by which protein kinases control spheroid growth and metastasis of ovarian
cancer cells, and use this information to develop kinase inhibitor therapies for the treatment of recurrent ovarian
cancer. The Cdc42 downstream effector protein kinases MRCKα and MRCKβ (MRCKs) are highly expressed
in ovarian cancer and have been implicated in cell migration, invasion and metastasis. Strikingly, we recently
discovered that inhibition of MRCK impaired actin cytoskeleton remodeling and focal adhesion assembly
blocking cell migration and spheroid growth and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, revealing MRCK as a new and
untapped target for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. Moreover, our most recent findings showed
inhibition of MRCK blocked tumor growth and induced tumor apoptosis in ovarian cancer xenografts and ascites
models. Nevertheless, the mechanistic basis for MRCK support of ovarian cancer pathogenesis remains poorly
understood. Our overall hypothesis is that MRCKs control spheroid growth and invasion of ovarian cancer cells
through the regulation of actin cytoskeleton remodeling that involves the phosphorylation and/or interaction with
proteins associated with actin and myosin signaling. To test this hypothesis, we have designed two Specific
Aims, Aim 1: Identify MRCK protein interactors/substrates that contribute to ovarian cancer using proteomics
strategies and Aim 2: Determine the effect of MRCK inhibition on spheroid viability and invasion using in vitro
and in vivo ovarian cancer models. In Aim 1, we will perform a focused analysis of our current MRCK substrate
candidates using phosphoantibodies and mass spectrometry in 2D and 3D cultures, and will decipher the
function of MRCK phosphorylation events using site-directed mutagenesis. Next, we will apply unbiased
proteomics methods to define additional interacting partners, substrates and signaling pathways controlled by
MRCK. Together, we will establish bona fide MRCK substrates and will define the mechanisms by which MRCK
promote spheroid proliferation, survival and invasion in ovarian cancer. In Aim 2, we will inhibit MRCK and
monitor viability, invasion and actin remodeling of ovarian cancer spheroids, organoids and ascites isolated from
patients with metastatic disease. Next, using a panel of orthotopic ovarian cancer patient-derived xenografts,
we will inhibit MRCK and measure in vivo tumor growth, metastasis and ascites. Together, the work proposed
here will define the mechanisms by which MRCKs promote ovarian cancer growth and metastasis and establish
MRCK as a new target in recurrent ovarian cancer."

The objective of this training program is for Vanderbilt-Vietnam Genetic Epidemiology Training Program (V2-
GENE) will join efforts across Vanderbilt University (VU) and low-middle income country (LMIC) partners Hanoi
Medical University (HMU), and Vietnam National Cancer institute (VNCI) to train scholars in the genetic
epidemiology of NCDs. Non-communicable disease (NCD) is the leading cause of death globally, accounting
for about 71% of the 56.9 million deaths that occurred worldwide in 2016 and 74% in 2022. With a population
over 96 million, Vietnam ranks as the 14th most populous country in the world. Vietnam, a LMIC. The goal of
the program is to develop a team of researchers and educators prepared with the necessary training and
expertise to lead genetic epidemiology research of non-communicable diseases (NCD) across the lifecourse in
Vietnam and to enhance engagement of US-based researchers in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).
We build upon existing partnerships across VU and HMU/NCI as well as the substantial expertise in genetics
and genomics research in NCD and research training in LMICs from investigators in the Vanderbilt
Epidemiology Center and the Vanderbilt Genetics Institute. We will leverage Vanderbilt’s robust and existing
infrastructure that provides training for faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and PhD graduate students to lead this
program. Integrating our training with these existing resources will ensure the success of the trainees
supported through our program. Specifically, the V2-GENE program seeks to: 1. Train leaders and trainers in
genetic epidemiology research. We will target three visiting faculty members from HMU and VNCI for one-year
appointments who have existing and complimentary expertise in epidemiology and molecular genetics
research. They will receive mentorship and grant writing training during their visit to VUMC. 2. Train scientists
and future leaders in genetic epidemiology research. This will be accomplished through combined US- and
Vietnam-based training activities (three predoctoral PhDs [three-year appointment], three MPH students [two-
year appointment], and one postdoctoral fellow [two-year appointment] from Vietnam) that include didactic
courses and mentored research activities. 3. Guide our training with activities that ensure a long-term impact.
Our approach of training the trainers and building training infrastructure within Vietnam will provide
sustainability for the program. The long-term follow-up of alumni will also foster collaborations and continued
support beyond the duration of the training period. Direct outcomes of this training program will be expanded
workforce and development of future leaders in genetic epidemiology research within Vietnam and further
engagement of US researchers in global health research. This synergistic partnership across VU and Vietnam
as part of the V2-GENE program will significantly enhance the research and training capacity for genetic and
genomics of NCD within Vietnam. This program will build the necessary workforce within Vietnam to lead the
next-generation of genetics researchers."

It remains unclear why some tissue injuries regenerate and heal while others fibrose and scar. It is evident,
however, that the inflammatory response underlies these divergent outcomes. This immune system’s response
to injury depends on a multitude of cell types and organ systems that remain in communication to evolve
collectively, guiding tissue-level outcomes. My lab’s expertise is in the design of local drug delivery systems for
immune modulation. We will leverage these delivery platforms to explore immune systems interactions after local
therapeutic delivery, with applications toward tissue healing and arresting inflammatory disease progression.
Theme 1: How does cell-targeted delivery of therapeutics alter monocyte & macrophage crosstalk?
Macrophages are a primary component of the innate immune system, acting as first-responders to injury and
initiating the activation of other cell types – including their replacement by monocyte precursors recruited from
the bone marrow. Promoting a pro-regenerative macrophage phenotype is a promising therapeutic avenue under
widespread investigation. However, little is known about how macrophage polarization alters monocyte
recruitment and differentiation. This project area builds on my experience in therapeutic macrophage polarization
to develop cell-targeted therapeutics that promote a pro-healing macrophage phenotype at the injury site,
exploring the hypothesis that altered monocyte recruitment and differentiation, not the long-lasting generation of
pro-healing macrophages, is the critical axis supporting an immunoregenerative response. Theme 2: How does
the promotion of early post-injury inflammation alter adaptive immune response? The magnitude and
temporal sequence of cell signals, including chemokines and cytokines, is a critical regulator of cell migration,
differentiation, and polarization; these processes guide evolution of the injury immune microenvironment and
resulting tissue-level outcomes. It has been recently observed that exogenous delivery of inflammatory signaling
promotes tissue healing after ischemic injury. Here, we will explore the hypothesis that beneficial effects result
from the recruitment and differentiation of regulatory T cells by macrophage-derived signals, which can be re-
capitulated by sequential biomolecule release from injectable hydrogels. If successful, this project will elucidate
new design principles for guiding the injury immune microenvironment toward a functional orientation that
supports tissue healing. Theme 3: Can remote drug delivery systems modulate damaging systemic
inflammation? A sequela of dysregulated systemic inflammation often results from significant tissue insults
(heart attack, kidney injury) or chronic inflammatory disease (inflammatory bowel, rheumatoid arthritis). Such
insults are associated with deleterious multi-organ effects, including renal and pulmonary fibrosis,
atherosclerosis, and heart failure. This area of research explores the capacity to develop refillable drug reservoirs
for delivering immunomodulatory drugs to distant immune organs, thereby modulating inflammation at the
primary cell sources."
10890201,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol consumption is a major cause of liver disease worldwide. Severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH), an acute
manifestation of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), is associated with inferior short-term survival. Unfortunately,
there are few effective medical therapies for SAH outside of corticosteroids, to which about 40% of patients are
refractory. For these patients, liver transplantation (LT) is the only rescue treatment available. Until recently,
most transplant centers mandated at least six months of continuous abstinence from alcohol before LT.
Unfortunately, this “6-month rule” was(is) often unachievable for patients with SAH, due to recent alcohol use
and high short-term mortality. Several recent studies from Europe and the United States championed the concept
of early liver transplantation (ELT) in this highly vulnerable patient cohort, though post-LT alcohol relapse
remained a concern with adverse consequences like graft injury and cirrhosis.
To date, there is no consensus on the optimal LT candidate selection criteria in ALD, which can lead to uneven
and substandard post-LT outcomes, including alcohol relapse. This project will advance our field in several ways.
First, it will define the impacts of ELT and alcohol abstinence on the natural history of SAH. Second, it will develop
and validate a novel LT candidate selection tool in ALD. The project findings will support a planned multicenter
trial and R01 submission for the external evaluation of the candidate selection tool.
This proposed work represents an interdisciplinary approach toward the optimization and the standardization of
the LT candidate selection process in ALD. To conduct this study, I will integrate myself into the research
community of the NIAAA P50-funded Johns Hopkins DELTA Center for Alcohol Research, which will help me
establish a network of alcohol researchers for current and future collaboration. I will also actively engage in
formal coursework in biostatistics and addiction science as well as interdisciplinary career development
programs. Through the proposed career development plan, I will gain the necessary skills and experience to
establish myself as an independent clinical investigator bridging the fields of hepatology, transplantation, and
addiction medicine."
10890202,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The oral mucosal microbiota is a complex ecosystem primarily represented by bacteria and fungi. Most
oropharyngeal fungal infections are caused by the genus Candida and are assumed to result from an
overgrowth of indigenous species, primarily C. albicans. C. albicans is a commensal colonizer of the oral
mucosa in humans, but is also responsible for infections afflicting immunocompromised hosts. Persistent
oropharyngeal thrush is refractory to most antifungals and a significant clinical problem in pharmacologically
immunosuppressed patients. Corticosteroid-induced and chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression, are two
main risk factors for oropharyngeal candidiasis in humans. C. albicans also causes fungemia, a serious
consequence of cancer cytotoxic chemotherapy, which is thought to develop from fungal translocation through
compromised mucosal barriers. Changes in endogenous bacterial population size or composition and in the
host environment can transform fungal commensals into pathobionts. Work in our previous funding cycle
established a synergistic relationship of mitis group streptococci with C. albicans in the pathogenesis of oral
candidiasis. We identified mechanisms of synergy which involved both a direct effect on fungal virulence gene
expression and a modification of host responses. In this project we will build on our ongoing studies examining
the interplay of the resident oral mucosal bacterial microbiota and C. albicans. We will use mouse models of
commensal colonization or mucosal infection to interrogate oral bacterial microbiome parameters that promote
C. albicans virulence. In aim 1 we will characterize dysbiotic changes in mucosa-associated bacterial
communities in oropharyngeal candidiasis, using our established mouse models of cortisone- and
chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression. We will then test the hypothesis that certain endogenous bacterial
species isolated from dysbiotic states can exhibit pathogenic synergy with C. albicans. In aim 2 we will define
the regulatory mechanisms of fungal-bacterial mucosal biofilm growth in each immunosuppression state.
Finally, in aim 3 we will examine the role of the dysbiotic communities and host response in mucosal barrier
breach and bloodstream dissemination by C. albicans. The proposed studies have the potential to lead to a
paradigm shift in how clinicians and scientists view the microbiome changes characterizing mucosal Candida
infections. This project will identify certain oral bacteria as new, clinically relevant mediators of invasive fungal
infections thus providing justification for the combined use of antifungal and anti-bacterial treatments in at risk
patients. A better understanding of the relationship between fungi and the oral microbiome could also result in
new biomarkers of infection risk or identification of probiotic commensals that could lower the likelihood of
invasive mucosal candidiasis in high-risk populations such as patients undergoing intensive cancer
chemotherapy."

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the world's leading cause of cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver-related
mortality. Its burden is increasing around the world, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Even though
millions of people across sub-Saharan Africa are known to have chronic hepatitis B infection, very few
eligible patients are started on treatment. The complexity and cost of laboratory monitoring, liver
fibrosis assessments, and antiviral treatment are some of the major challenges preventing scale-up of
treatment.
My goal is to determine whether hepatitis B management guidelines can be simplified so that limited
healthcare resources are focused on expanding hepatitis B treatment in resource-limited settings.
Simulation models are evidence-based tools that are increasingly being used by investigators to
address complex questions such as this, by assessing the long-term clinical impact of existing as well
as novel hepatitis B treatment initiation strategies. I am an Infectious Diseases physician with a
research background in clinical epidemiology, simulation modeling, and cost-effectiveness analysis. I
am motivated to expand on my current skillset and gain training to apply these methodologies to
investigate HBV treatment strategies in sub-Saharan Africa.
The Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will afford me the opportunity to gain the
necessary skills to become an independent clinical investigator. I require specific training in (1) model
design and validation; (2) derivation of clinical and economic outcome data; and (3) designing and
executing cost-effectiveness analyses. I have designed a didactic curriculum to address each of
these training aims. I have also assembled a multi-disciplinary team of mentors and collaborators with
methodological and/ or content expertise who are devoted to my success in achieving the aims of this
proposal. By the end of the award period, I will have designed and validated a novel HBV simulation
model, populated the model with clinical and economic data from sub-Saharan Africa, and used the
model conduct a high impact cost-effectiveness analysis that has the potential to guide HBV
management across the continent."

 Transposable elements (TEs) comprise roughly half of the human genomes, and some TE subfamilies
can even contain hundreds of thousands of copies, such as LINE and SINE elements. Highly enriched
transcriptional factor binding sites in the TEs sequence enable TEs the huge regulatory potential to the host
genome. Mounting evidence suggests some of TEs escaped from epigenetic silencing and actively involved in
multiple biological processes of host genome. TEs are significant contributors to the origin of vertebrate long
non-coding RNAs, and some TEs are also found to play roles as promoters in early development and some
terminally differentiated tissues. Our recent study found that domesticated rodent-specific TEs can play roles
as promoters to initiate the tissue-specific transcription of more than 300 genes during mouse tissue
differentiation. However, how the domesticated TEs-derived promoters in the human genome to regulate the
gene transcription in distinct tissues and cell types, is not clearly characterized. For example, we do not know
how many genes can be transcribed by TEs-derived promoters in particular human tissues; we have no idea
about the usage of TEs-derived promoters in the different cell types from the same tissue; finally, how
domesticated TEs in the human genome created novel tissue-specific expression pattern of conserved protein-
coding genes, is still mystified. Thus, in this proposed project, we will focus on investigating the tissue- and
cell type-specific gene transcription controlled by the domesticated TEs-derived promoters in the
human genome. Leveraging the big data generated by large consortiums, e.g., ENCODE, Roadmap
Epigenomics, GTEx, and Human Cell Atlas, we will perform a systematic survey of the usage of domesticated
TEs-derived promoters in the human genome. Firstly, we will identify the TEs that were domesticated as
promoters of protein-coding genes and non-coding genes in the human genome, and further characterize the
tissue-level expression pattern of domesticated TEs-derived transcripts, by using our established transcripts
assemble pipeline to analyze the tissue bulk RNA-seq data generated by ENCODE and GTEx. Secondly, we
will investigate the cell-type-specific expression pattern of domesticated TEs-derived transcripts, by
reconstructing the single-cell RNA-seq data analysis with novel bioinformatics analysis tool. Finally, we will
apply comparative-genomics approaches to create the expression matrix of orthologous TEs-derived protein-
coding genes across multi-species, and construct the phylogenetic trees to explore the expression pattern
changes of TEs-derived protein-coding genes during evolution."

The University of Minnesota Department of Pediatrics and Masonic Cancer Center propose to continue a
highly successful training program in translational and genomic pediatric cancer epidemiology research. Our
program is sought nationally ‐by scholars, and provides opportunities for 1 predoctoral and 3 postdoctoral
students to enhance their research and experience across a spectrum of pediatric cancer research, with a
goal of interdisciplinary cross training. With 19 outstanding mentoring faculty, trainees work in a variety of
research settings including classical epidemiology, genomic epidemiology, laboratory studies, and clinical
investigations. Along with seminars specific to pediatric cancer, strong graduate school degree programs at
the University of Minnesota in Epidemiology (PhD) and in Clinical Research (MS) offer opportunities for
courses in epidemiology, cancer epidemiology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, cancer biology, genetic
epidemiology, immunology, clinical trials/methods, and field research. Further, students have several
unparalleled opportunities for supervised translational and genomic research projects in human, animal, and
in vitro data, study design and development, statistical analysis, and individual and team grant writing.
Predoctoral students are formally admitted to the graduate school PhD program in Epidemiology. The
postdoctoral trainees are drawn from the medical, basic and applied sciences through national advertising and
our Masonic Cancer Center members, and from the cohort of medical fellows in the Department of Pediatrics
who have completed advanced clinical training in pediatric oncology and are embarking on the research
component of their training. Spe‐cial attention is given to recruitment of individuals from underrepresented
minorities. We anticipate that two of our postdoctoral trainees will choose to obtain an MS in clinical research.
Criteria for selection of both pre and postdoctoral trainees include a strong academic performance and a
career orientation toward independent research in an academic, clinical, or public health setting. Each trainee
is guided by at least two senior mentors from complementary disciplines in their research projects. All trainees
participate in courses in pediatric cancer topics and readings in pediatric cancer epidemiology, weekly
pediatric cancer seminar meetings and pediatric tumor conferences, monthly seminars, annual retreats, and
presenters of their own research at national meetings. Postdoctoral students receive additional training in
grant writing/preparation. All receive instruction in the responsible conduct of research. Trainees who graduate
from this program will have the capacity to undertake high impact pediatric cancer research across a spectrum
of disciplines."
10890634,"The porphyrias are a group of metabolic disorders that are caused by defects in heme biosynthesis pathway
enzymes, and liver is commonly either a source or target of excess porphyrins. Treatment for most of the
porphyrias is limited, and often focused on symptomatic relief and palliative care. Thus, mechanistic-based
studies that emphasize therapeutic development are desperately needed. Previous work has identified the
Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway as a modulatable target in the 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine
(DDC) diet-induced mouse model of porphyria. Inhibition of b-catenin in mice subjected to DDC results in a
significant reduction in liver injury due to decreased porphyrin accumulation. We identified a network of key
heme biosynthesis enzymes such as δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthetase and ALA-dehydratase that are
suppressed in the absence of b-catenin, resulting in decreased production of porphyrin intermediates and
DDC-associated protein aggregation. Autophagy is also increased in mice lacking b-catenin, which may further
contribute to protection from injury. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of the proposal is that inhibiting
Wnt/b-catenin signaling in clinically-relevant models of porphyria will alleviate injury and progression of
disease through decreased production of porphyrin intermediates and/or increased autophagy. In aim 1, we
will determine the most proximal step in the pathway that is affected by b-catenin inhibition by treating
hepatocytes with ALA and measuring the appearance of porphyrin intermediates; investigate the mechanism
by which b-catenin regulates heme enzymes through site-directed mutagenesis, in silico studies, and chromatin
immunoprecipitation; and demonstrate therapeutic relevance of targeting β-catenin in patients by utilizing
immunohistochemistry to correlate the extent of b-catenin expression with expression of heme enzymes. In
aim 2, we will characterize the role and regulation of autophagy in porphyria after Wnt/b-catenin inhibition.
We will use RFP-EGFP-LC3 mice, a pH-dependent fluorescent reporter strain, and a genetic knockout of
glutamine synthetase, a component of the b-catenin/mTOR pathway, as well as in vitro assays, to
comprehensively address the contribution of this cellular process to the observed protected phenotype. In aim
3, we will determine whether inhibiting b-catenin in genetic mouse models of porphyria decreases porphyrin
accumulation and improves liver pathology. Two well-characterized porphyria models: the ferrochelatase
(Fechm1Pas) mutant mice, which mimics human erythropoietic protoporphyria with significant liver
involvement; and the T1/T2 mouse, which is compound heterozygous for hydroxymethylbilane synthase and
mimics acute intermittent porphyria upon stimulation with phenobarbitol, will be utilized to determine
whether therapeutic intervention with a b-catenin inhibitor can prevent progression or provide protection
during acute attacks. Thus, the proposed studies will further our understanding of the potential for inhibiting
b-catenin to treat porphyria, & will provide highly significant information for therapeutic and translational use."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the fastest growing neurological disease, outpacing even Alzheimer’s. A gap in the
effective treatment of PD is the reliance on capacity-based clinical assessments, such as the MDS-UPDRS III,
to guide clinical decision-making. Clinical ratings, while simple to administer, provide a poor estimation of PD
performance of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Declines in IADL performance are of particular
importance, as recent population-based cohort studies indicate that IADL decline pre-dates clinical diagnosis of
PD by 5-7 years and predict the transition from independence to dependent care settings. In order to advance
PD treatment and discovery, objective measures of disease symptoms during the performance of ‘real-world’
IADL scenarios must be created. Augmented reality technology, in which computer-generated images are
superimposed in the user’s real-world view, enable the presentation of digital scenarios to replicate IADLs and
objectively quantify user’s performance via integrated IMUs and depth camera. The primary aim of this project
is to develop an accurate, valid, and reliable augmented reality assessment platform for the quantification of
motor and non-motor performance of PD under clinical and IADL augmented reality environments. The
proposed Comprehensive Augmented Reality Test (CART) platform for PD will objectively quantify the cardinal
motor signs of PD, as well as IADL performance, to facilitate comprehensive treatment of symptoms and
precise tracking of disease progression that can eventually be used to optimize medication and deep brain
stimulation programming. A multi-disciplinary team of experts in the areas of software and biomedical
engineering, neurology, neurosurgery, neuropsychology, physical therapy and statistics will collaborate to
develop the CART platform and determine its accuracy, validity and reliability. Particular attention will be spent
on quantifying the interplay between motor and cognitive tasks, as dual-tasks performance is linked to gait
dysfunction and falls and historically has been overlooked in clinical assessments. Following the development
stage, a series of psychometric studies and analyses will be conducted to determine the accuracy, validity and
reliability of the CART platform in a cohort of 140 individuals with PD (n=35 in each Hoehn and Yahr Stage I-
IV) and 35 age-matched controls. The CART PD platform has the potential to transform the treatment of PD
globally by creating an equal emphasis on clinical symptoms and IADL performance through the use of an
affordable consumer-available electronic device that is suitable for the integration into treatment delivery
systems."

The degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons within the basal ganglia (BG) causes Parkinson's disease (PD).
One of its cardinal symptoms is the slowing of volitional movements of the hands, arms and/or legs, known as
bradykinesia. Although much has been learned over the past several decades about the physiological
consequences of DA neuron loss on the activity of neurons within the BG, much less in understood about how
dysfunction of the BG ultimately impacts downstream brain regions to impair motor and cognitive abilities. Our
long-term goal is to address this gap in knowledge in the hopes of identifying novel therapies to alleviate PD’s
motor and non-motor symptoms. This exploratory R21 proposal represents the first step in this endeavor: it aims
to distinguish the relative contribution of two main neural projections out of the BG – one feeding back to cortex
via the thalamus vs. one feeding forward to brainstem nuclei – to bradykinesia. This proposal leverages a
combination of imaging and optogenetic manipulations in mice performing a dexterous forelimb motor task before
and after DA neuron lesions with 6-hydroxydopamine. Our experiments will test the hypothesis that bradykinesia
results from impairments in BG feedback to cortex via thalamus by comparing and contrasting the activity of BG
output neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) that project to thalamus or brainstem using axonal
Ca2+ photometry (Aim 1) and by testing the ability of BG efferents to restore vigorous forelimb movements using
optogenetic manipulations (Aim 2). We will benchmark our findings to levodopa treatment to concentrate on
therapeutically-effective pathways and validate them in a mouse genetic model of PD in which DA neurons
degenerate progressively. Our findings will deepen our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of PD’s
symptoms and stimulate investigations into novel, DA-independent therapeutic targets outside the BG to provide
effective and continued symptomatic relief from motor impairments."

The South Carolina Department of Agriculture (SCDA) seeks funding support for costs associated
with maintaining a comprehensive and integrated animal feed safety program, allowing for six
final months of development followed by three years of maintenance with the Animal Feed
Regulatory Program Standards (AFRPS). Funding is also being sought to expand independent PC
and cGMP inspections under South Carolina state authority.
SCDA Consumer Protection Division (CPD) has been involved in the process of AFRPS compliance
since 2014. Initially, the primary obstacle to achieving conformance with the Standards was
insufficient staffing. To overcome this barrier, SCDA applied for and began the AFRPS
Cooperative Agreement Program (CAP) with FDA in 2017. Currently in the fifth year of this
agreement, three full time personnel are employed with AFRPS funding, one AFRPS Coordinator,
one Feed Safety Inspector, and one Feed Safety Compliance Officer are exclusively dedicated to
the successful development and maintenance of the SCDA Feed Program. The Feed Program
Manager and one additional Feed Safety Inspector have also been employed partially by AFRPS
funding to aid in the inspectional efforts of the Standards. These five personnel are also
anticipated to aid in the PC Funding Option requirements.

ESCRT protein complexes play essential roles in membrane remodeling for multivesicular body formation,
intercellular communication, formation of the nuclear envelope, and cell division. We recently showed that the
obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii repurposes host ESCRT machinery to acquire macromolecular
resources from infected cells. Host-derived resources critically fuel rapid growth of T. gondii acute stage
parasites, which are responsible for debilitating disease in immunodeficient or congenitally infected individuals.
Although we identified one parasite effector protein (GRA14) that directly binds the ESCRT-I complex protein
TSG101 and recruits it to the parasite’s replicative compartment, this protein only accounts for ~50% of TSG101
recruitment. Using a novel combination of CRISPR/Cas9 screening, high content imaging, and machine learning-
driven image analysis, in addition to GRA14, we identified 7 new parasite secretory proteins that putatively
contribute to TSG101 recruitment. Among the newly identified parasite proteins was ROP18, which is a major
virulence factor that is best known for effector function in evading innate immunity. Importantly, ROP18 deficient
parasites showed significantly less recruitment of TSG101, thus validating it as a hit and exposing a novel
function for this parasite kinase. However, additional studies are necessary to determine how ROP18 contributes
to TSG101 recruitment and which of the other 6 hits function in such recruitment. To meet this need, in Aim 1
we will determine if the kinase activity of ROP18 is required for TSG101 recruitment to the PV and identify
ROP18-linked parasite and host proteins that regulate TSG101 recruitment. In Aim 2, we will validate other hits
from the screen and determine if they are working in conjunction with GRA14 or ROP18. Together, these studies
will identify a novel protein network responsible for engaging host ESCRT machinery to ensure the successful
replication of an important human pathogen."

Immigration-related trauma, including deportation, detention, and discrimination upon arrival, is detrimental to
the health and well-being of children in immigrant families (CIF). Latinx people in the United States (US)
experience high rates of such trauma. A comprehensive understanding of adverse childhood experiences
(ACEs) among Latinx CIF experiencing immigration-related trauma would facilitate recognition of and response
to signs and symptoms of trauma. While pediatricians may suspect that CIF have experienced trauma, this
trauma is not being captured in settings best equipped to identify and intervene to address childhood trauma,
such as primary care. The objective of this proposal is to build and test a primary care trauma-informed care
questionnaire (TICQ) that screens for the unique traumatic experiences (ACEs) of Latinx children in immigrant
families. This study, entitled MOSAICO: Modifying and Optimizing a Screener of Adverse Immigrant Childhood
Occurrences for Trauma-Informed Care (TIC) in Pediatric Settings, seeks to adapt, implement, and validate a
TICQ for Latinx CIF by following the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS)
qualitative item development and review process. Aim 1 Step 1 generates items through thematic analysis of
focus group data, participatory ideation, and a priori identification of trauma screeners. Aim 1 Step 2 classifies
(“bins”) and selects (“winnows”, pile-sorts, and ranks) items with Latinx CIF and Latinx parents. Aim 1 Step 3
revises and reviews items via cognitive interviews with Latinx CIF. Aim 2 pilot implements this new trauma
TICQ in a pediatric primary care practice in Baltimore City that primarily serves Latinx CIF. Aim 3 calibrates
screening items included in the TICQ with adapted and piloted items through confirmatory factor analysis
(CFA) of a large sample of Latinx CIF. These research aims and career development plan provide Keith
Martin, DO, MS the skills to achieve his overall career goal of becoming an independent investigator focused
on TIC of CIF in primary care. Dr. Martin’s training plan includes experiential learning and didactic coursework
to achieve the following short-term training goals: 1) Gain expertise and understanding in the theory and
clinical application of the intersection between intergenerational migration and trauma; 2) Study and optimize
screening and intervention in primary care; 3) Apply practical implementation science and clinical informatic
strategies; 4) Develop skills in screening item development and construct validation; and, 5) Continue skill
building in the responsible conduct of re-search (RCR), manuscript writing, and grant writing. Dr. Martin will
receive focused mentorship and consultation from a team of experts in primary care level intervention (Dr.
Perrin), early life adversity (Dr. Johnson), implementation science (Dr. Bass), psychometric analysis (Dr.
Musci), and health disparities among Latinx CIF (Dr. Polk).The rich research environment at Johns Hopkins
University will allow Dr. Martin to fulfill his research and career development plans and begin to address his
long-term goal of improving the health of CIF by leveraging pediatric primary care to further child well-being."

Non-medical use of prescription opioids (NMUPO) is a timely and significant public health issue in the United
States (US). Young adults are the key population vulnerable to NMUPO. Existing literature indicates that
NMUPO in young adults is influenced by a robust array of psychosocial factors. Tailored interventions guided
by a psychosocial theory, such as the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model, are urgently
needed for addressing NMUPO in young adults. One innovative approach is to reach out to and deliver
psychosocial interventions to young adults via social media technology, yet limited efforts have sought to
develop such interventions for NMUPO among young adults. Thus the scientific objective of this K01 is to
gather data via IMB-guided formative study regarding psychosocial influences on NMPUO and then to use
these findings to inform the development of a peer-led social media intervention designed to reduce NMUPO
among young adults. The career development objective of this K01 is to obtain intensive mentored training
essential to improving the theoretical and practical expertise needed to develop innovative and implementable
peer-led psychosocial interventions for NMUPO in high-risk populations. The training will be supported by the
rigorous and highly productive research environment at the University of South Carolina and by a mentor team
with expertise in addiction treatment, health psychology, peer support group, formative assessment, social
media and psychosocial intervention design, mixed methodology, ecological momentary assessment, as well as
intervention development, implementation, and evaluation. Training progression is linked to three specific
research aims. In Aim 1, we conduct formative research, guided by the IMB model, to explore psychosocial
contents associated with NMUPO in young adults. We then use the findings from Aim 1 to develop a peer-led
social media intervention to reduce NMUPO among young adults (Aim 2) by integrating promising
psychotherapy principles and incorporating with peer leaders who are well-trained for recovery coaching. In
Aim 3, we conduct a pretesting of the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and preliminary efficacy on NMUPO
reduction and psychosocial changes of the theory-based social media intervention with a 12-week pilot
randomized controlled trial among 70 NMUPO engaging young adults (35 for intervention and 35 for control)
via pre-test, 12-week ecological momentary assessment (during the intervention), and post-tests (12-month
follow-ups). This project will contribute to future largescale and fully-powered psychosocial interventions for
NMUPO among young adults or other high-risk populations using innovative technology that can address
challenges in traditional substance use interventions."

Childhood adversity (CA) is one of the most potent risk factors for psychopathology across the lifespan, largely
due to enduring disruptions in the body’s stress response system. Further, the cascade of molecular and
neurobiological transformations following CA distinguishes patients from non-exposed counterparts, spurring a
more pernicious course of illness, greater symptom severity, more comorbidities, and less favorable response
to treatments. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify transdiagnostic mechanisms of risk. This proposal
facilitates the long-term goal of identifying intervention targets, guided by evidence that adolescence is a period
of vulnerability to stress that is accentuated by prior CA exposure. To date, investigations of neural,
physiologic, and behavioral stress response deficits following CA have been conducted in relatively separate
literatures, and the majority of these studies have taken a cumulative risk approach (i.e., “total adversity”)
without attention to shared features among certain types of CA. Further, investigations of regulatory processes
have generally examined either broad-level dysregulation or honed in on only regulatory strategy (e.g.,
reappraisal), neglecting to account for the dynamic nature of stress responsivity. This proposal addresses a
critical gap in current research by examining a comprehensive set of stress responses, including emotion
reactivity, emotion regulation (ER), and ER flexibility, each of which is a malleable target for intervention,
spanning multiple units of analyses. Specifically, this study will examine CA characterized by threat (e.g.,
abuse, witnessing domestic violence), physiologic reactivity across multiple systems (i.e., HPA axis,
parasympathetic and sympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system), and neural activation during an
fMRI paradigm that allows for an assessment of initial stress reactivity as well as ER strategy selection,
implementation, and flexibility (i.e., evaluation and modification of a strategy based on the stressor/context).
The sample will be comprised of 100 adolescents, aged 14-16 with varying levels of threat exposure. In
addition to the initial assessment, participants will complete a six-month follow-up to measure prospective
psychopathology symptoms, addressing a secondary focus of this proposal linking stress response patterns to
internalizing and externalizing pathology. Employing a multi-unit analysis of acute stress responses will
facilitate the characterization of precise CA-related decrements in reactivity and regulation that confer
psychopathology risk during a crucial developmental period."

The neuron is one of the highest energy-consuming cells within the body. It requires energy to
maintain complex electrical gradients for neuron activation and signal transduction via synaptic
vesicle release. The mitochondria are critical to efficiently create energy and their location within
the cell is tightly regulated through the use of motor protein complexes kinesin (anterograde)
and dynein (retrograde). General anesthetics have been shown to bind to kinesin motor proteins
and decrease their processivity. However, the effect of that binding on cellular machinery,
energy homeostasis and anesthetic sensitivity has not been studied.
This project explores the affect general anesthetics have on mitochondrial location, and by
extension energy, using both the zebrafish in vivo model organism and primary neural cell
culture. I define mitochondrial movement alterations when exposed to different anesthetics.
Next, I define zebrafish larvae and neural cells within two mitochondrial transport, kif5Aa and
actr10, as well as how that movement is altered in response to different anesthetics. Finally, I
will determine how changing the mitochondrial distribution within neurons affects whole
organism behavior by testing for changes in sensitivity to anesthetics within zebrafish larvae.
Completing this project will enhance my skills in neurobiology, mitochondrial biology, advanced
statistics and programming. With these skills I will be able to create a unique niche within the
field of anesthesia. This project will also give me to preliminary data to launch as an
independent investigator and write an R01."

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) carries a dismal prognosis and remains a critical unmet public health need. The recent recognition that a subset of pancreas cancer harbors potential neoantigens has intensified interest in defining the molecular and cellular mechanisms of immune evasion in PDAC to guide effective therapeutic strategies that leverage the adaptive immune system in this disease. However, difficulty in precisely defining the tumor-reactive T cell compartment has hampered prior efforts to delineate the full spectrum of mechanisms by which PDAC evades immune eradication. I hypothesize that a subset of PDAC escapes immune surveillance through dysfunction and/or altered localization of tumor-reactive T cells. Our preliminary studies, using neoantigen-expressing preclinical models of PDAC to evaluate tumor-specific immune responses, have revealed that a significant subset of tumors acquire the ability to evade immune clearance and that neoantigen-specific cos• tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) adopt multiple states of dysfunction. Additionally, we recently demonstrated that the CD155/TIGIT axis both promotes and maintains immune evasion in PDAC (Freed-Pastor et al. Cancer Cell, in press). In this proposal, I leverage recently developed preclinical models, advances in single-cell profiling, and highly multiplexed imaging modalities to interrogate the cytotoxic T cell compartment in murine and human PDAC. Specifically, I will evaluate the effects of TIGIT/PD-1 co-blockade plus CD40 agonism on the tumor-immune microenvironment in PDAC using single-cell transcriptomic and highly multiplexed immunofluorescence technologies. I will also utilize flow cytometry and multiplexed imaging to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of T cell phenotypes and localization during tumor progression in preclinical models, and compare T cell responses to different neoantigens. Furthermore, I will perform high-resolution profiling on TILs isolated directly from pancreas cancer patients. Collectively, these studies hold tremendous promise for accelerating effective immune-based therapies for PDAC. The proposed research will be performed at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, under the guidance of Dr. Tyler Jacks, an international leader in cancer biology and tumor immunology, with co-mentorship by Dr. Brian Wolpin, a leading pancreas cancer researcher at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Importantly, this research strategy is one part of a comprehensive training program to support my transition to an independent research career in basic and translational cancer biology and tumor immunology. My scientific advisors (Drs. Arlene Sharpe, Stefani Spranger, and Osama Rahma) are distinguished experts with experience highly relevant to the proposed research. My long-term goal is to lead an independent academic research group, focused on deciphering the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which PDAC evades immune clearance, such that these insights can be used to guide therapeutic strategies to combat pancreas cancer and other cancers. The K08 award will provide pivotal protected time for continued mentored research and enable a successful transition to independence."

Although the importance of synaptic Zn2+, as an emerging neuromodulator throughout the brain, has been widely
appreciated, the dynamics of synaptic Zn2+ release in response to naturally occurring stimuli remains largely
elusive. Genetically encoded Zn2+ indicators (GEZIs) derived from fluorescent proteins are popular tools for
imaging Zn2+ in the cytosol and intracellular organelles. However, fluorescence imaging of Zn2+ secretion in the
brain in live animals has not yet been achieved due to the limitations of current GEZIs (e.g., insufficient
extracellular membrane localization, mismatching affinity, and/or inadequate dynamic range and photostability).
This interdisciplinary multi-PI 4-year R01 project, led by Dr. Huiwang Ai with expertise in genetically encoded
indicators and fluorescence imaging and Dr. Thanos Tzounopoulos with expertise in studying the role of Zn2+ in
auditory processing, aims to (1) develop a new generation of GEZIs to address the hurdles for imaging secreted
Zn2+ in the brain in vivo, and (2) integrate the new GEZIs with our innovative ZnT3 cKO mice, which, for the first
time, allow for Cre-dependent expression of exogenous genes in ZnT3-expressing neurons and Dre-dependent
region- and cell type-specific conditional ZnT3 gene knockout, to identify the cell- and circuit-specificity of Zn2+
dynamics that shape cortical sound processing.
The project will lead to a novel capability of imaging synaptically released Zn2+ in the brain in awake behaving
animals. Our innovative strategy to optimize the exoplasmic location of GEZIs may be generalized to enhance
other genetically encoded indicators. Furthermore, because synaptic Zn2+ is a potent modulator throughout the
cortex, our findings on Zn2+ dynamics in the primary auditory cortex (A1) during sound processing will improve
the understanding of the roles of synaptic Zn2+ in cortical information processing beyond sensory cortices. We
expect our studies to catalyze an extensive array of studies on Zn2+-related neurobiology and neurological
diseases."

Statins are the most widely used medication in reducing blood cholesterol and preventing coronary
heart disease. However, adherence is poor; studies report fewer than half of patients take statins as
prescribed. One of the main barriers in statin adherence is symptoms related to myopathy which include
muscle discomfort, weakness, and rhabdomyolysis, a potentially life-threatening condition. Yet, the underlying
mechanism of statin-induced myopathy (SIM) remains poorly understood due to 1) complex pleiotropic and
myotoxic effects of statins, 2) limited accessibility of affected patients’ myocytes, and 3) lack of appropriate
animal models to investigate the differential susceptibilities of statin toxicity. Previous clinical and scientific
findings suggest off-target effects of statins in the mitochondria as the mechanism of SIM, but the results have
not been validated in human studies.
Recent advances in the generation of skeletal muscle cells (SkMCs) from human iPSCs present an
unprecedented opportunity to model skeletal muscle diseases such as SIM. Herein, I propose to investigate
the disease mechanisms of SIM by using a patient-specific iPSC platform. Specifically, I will test the central
hypothesis that SIM is mediated via skeletal muscle-specific off-target effects resulting in mitochondrial redox
imbalance, metabolic compromise and subsequent cell death. For this study, I will first characterize metabolic
consequences of statins in iPSC-derived SkMCs and patient myocytes (Aim 1). I will then investigate the
mechanism behind patient-specific differential myopathic susceptibility to statins by comparing iPSC-SkMCs
derived from patients tolerant of statins to patients suffering from SIM (Aim 2). Finally, I will identify novel
genes critical in the pathogenesis of SIM utilizing a genome-scale CRISPR interference screening technique
by specifically silencing genes involved in statin toxicity and thereby conferring statin tolerance (Aim 3). The
findings from this study will elucidate the molecular mechanism of SIM and facilitate the creation of precision
medicine tools to enhance the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of SIM."

Orofacial clefts are one of the most prevalent craniofacial birth defects in humans, which are characterized by
incomplete formation of oral and facial structures that separate the nasal and oral cavities. These congenital
disorders, if not successfully managed with a series of surgical interventions on lips, alveolus, hard/soft palates,
may lead to critical abnormalities of children’s growth development of the maxillary and the midface, insufficient
speaking, impaired respiratory function, and psychosocial problems such as low self-esteem. In current clinical
practice, the gold standard treatment for hard tissue reconstruction such as cleft palate with alveolar cleft is most
commonly involved with autologous bone graft; however, autologous tissue grafts are limited in availability,
require additional invasive surgery, and have donor site morbidity. More critically, the major shortcomings of the
autologous bone grafts include significant bone loss after grafting and their unpredictable success rate. In this
proposed project, our central hypothesis is that structurally, compositionally biomimetic bone scaffolds without
cell seeding could utilize host stem/progenitor cells for in situ orofacial cleft reconstruction. Thus, the objective
is to investigate the clinical feasibility of this novel bone scaffolding system using a clinically relevant animal
model for orofacial cleft reconstruction. To achieve this, we will utilize 3D bioprinting technology to fabricate a
personalized bone scaffold with clinically relevant size, shape, and structural integrity. In addition, we will utilize
a noninvasive real-time near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging platform to monitor mineralization for bone
regeneration along with scaffold degradation. We also hypothesize that this NIR imaging platform can provide a
comprehensive understanding of the relationship between scaffold degradation and in situ bone regeneration.
The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three Specific Aims: 1) Develop and characterize
compositionally biomimetic bone scaffolds for in situ orofacial cleft reconstruction; 2) Develop a novel
noninvasive monitoring system using NIR-functionalized bone scaffolds; 3) Validate 3D bioprinted
biofunctionalized bone scaffolds in a clinically applicable rabbit orofacial cleft defect model. Upon conclusion, we
will develop a clinically relevant 3D bioprinting workflow that can be utilized for orofacial cleft reconstruction. With
our successful completion of this project, we will apply this novel approach toward the creation of personalized
bone grafts as an effective treatment for orofacial clefts in children."
10886232,"Project Summary: Immunotherapies have revolutionized the clinical treatment of melanoma; however, these
treatment strategies have been ineffective in treating late stage and metastatic melanoma lesions with overall
patient response rates below 50% illustrating an unmet medical need in melanoma therapy.
We have previously demonstrated that mitochondrial metabolism played an important role in melanoma
metastasis and hence, I sought to investigate the role of mitochondria in facilitating this aggressive form of the
disease. Interestingly, our preliminary results indicate that specific deletion of mitochondrial complex I subunit
Ndufs4 in tumor cells led to a dramatic anti-tumor immune response. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses of
the tumor samples reveal that mitochondrial complex I inhibition induces an upregulation of proteins involved in
antigen presentation, and a shift of choline metabolism from choline-sarcosine pathway to choline-
phosphatidylcholine pathway. Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) analyses reveal a significant increase of NKT
cells. However, the mechanisms by which mitochondrial complex I inhibition induces antigen presentation,
metabolic flux shift and NKT cell activation are still waiting to be explored.
Based on our encouraging preliminary results, I seek to further explore the mechanisms whereby mitochondrial
complex I activity in tumor cells modulates immune response in tumor microenvironment by focusing on three
Aims. In Aim-1, I will determine the mechanisms of how mitochondrial complex I inhibition enhances MHC-I
dependent antigen presentation. In Aim-2, I plan to determine the mechanisms whereby mitochondrial complex
I inhibition causes the metabolic shift, choline-betaine to choline-phosphatidylcholine, and its potential roles in
NKT cell recruitment and activation. Finally, in Aim-3 I will evaluate the efficacy of combination treatment of
immune checkpoint inhibitors with mitochondrial complex I inhibition in preclinical mouse melanoma models.
While Aims 1 and part of 2 will be completed during the training stage, part of Aim 2 and the entire Aim 3 will be
conducted during the independent phase of the award.
The extensive training in different fields proposed in this application including proteomics, metabolomics and
immunology will provide the tools to for me to become an independent researcher and study the mechanisms of
which mitochondrial complex I regulates immune response in the tumor microenvironment. This training will be
received in the vibrant scientific communities of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School. This
environment will expose me to the collaborations and discussions necessary for career development and future
opportunities. Dr. Puigserver mentorship will be supportive to establish those connections and actively guide me
in talk and manuscript preparation, student mentorship, experimental design, and career development. Together,
the research and career development plans proposed in this application will strengthen my skills and
competitiveness to become an independent researcher at a major institution."
10886352,"ABSTRACT
 New SARS-CoV-2 variants and novel coronaviruses will constantly arise and affect large proportions of
the worldwide population. Although the current wave of infections with Omicron subvariants is much less lethal
than that caused by previous SARS-CoV-2 variants (e.g., Wuhan-Hu1, Alpha, and Delta), about 10% of Omicron-
infected patients develop prolonged post-acute neurological sequelae involving cognitive impairments (“brain
fog”), difficulty concentrating, anxiety, and depression. Histological studies of brains from COVID-19 patients
have often observed immune cell infiltrates and increased frequencies of glial cells with inflammatory phenotypes
indicative of neuroinflammatory responses. Currently, there are no approved prophylactic or interventive
treatments for SARS-CoV-2-induced neuroinflammation.
 There is a growing body of evidence that immune cells, microglia, and astrocytes express γ -aminobutyric
acid receptors (GABAA-Rs). The activation of these GABAA-Rs inhibits their pro-inflammatory activities and shifts
T cells, antigen-presenting cells, microglia, and astrocytes toward anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Taking
advantage of these properties, researchers have used homotaurine, a clinically applicable GABAA-R agonist that
can cross the blood-brain-barrier, to 1) reverse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) a model of
multiple sclerosis (MS) and 2) reduce the levels inflammatory cytokines in the CNS, decrease neuronal loss, and
ameliorate behavioral deficits in a model of autism spectrum disorder. Furthermore, we have shown that GABAA-
R agonists reduce circulating proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, viral replication in the lungs, the severity
of illness, and death in mice infected with two different coronaviruses: MHV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, in
clinical trials, homotaurine treatment has had some promising beneficial effects in Alzheimer’s disease patients.
 We contend that homotaurine is an excellent candidate for preventing and ameliorating SARS-CoV-2-
induced neuroinflammation. We will test this hypothesis in the hamster model of long COVID, arguably the best
rodent model available at this time. We anticipate that we will demonstrate the potential of an entirely new drug
class to help prevent and ameliorate SARS-CoV-2-induced neuroinflammation. Because homotaurine is safe for
human consumption, it could be rapidly tested in clinical trials. Since the mechanism evoked by GABAA-R
activation is unlike that of any other drugs being considered for treating long COVID, GABAA-R agonists are
likely to have enhanced therapeutic effects when combined with other treatments. Finally, the results may have
broader applications to treat other conditions involving CNS inflammation. Therefore, the results of our studies
may provide novel approaches to help improve the health of the global community."
10888228,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Many Americans (mostly children) have a genetic disease so rare it is termed an “orphan disease” with no
approved treatment and little incentive for investment in therapy given the rarity. However, it is now possible to
design, develop, and deliver gene-targeted treatments that work for as few as a single patient, i.e., as truly
individualized medicines. These “n-of-1” treatments began with a class of drugs called “antisense
oligonucleotides” (ASOs), first demonstrated in 2018 when a customized ASO was designed to target a
specific pathogenic genetic variant on behalf of a child with a fatal and otherwise untreatable genetic condition.
This effort created a blueprint for treating other individuals with orphan diseases. Not surprisingly, that pilot
case brought forth a multitude of hopeful families asking about their children’s eligibility for similar
interventions, and at least six academic institutions have launched efforts in this space to develop additional
individualized n-of-1 therapies. The development of customized investigational therapies for single or few
individuals is at present expensive, both in terms of cost and time, and raises a host of ethical, legal, and social
implication (ELSI) challenges, including justice, equity, therapeutic misconception, hope-therapeutic optimism,
informed consent, experimental treatment of children unable to consent or assent, best interests of the child,
and appropriate thresholds of evidence for safety and efficacy when dealing with fatal orphan diseases that
lack other treatments. There is a critical need to gather input from diverse stakeholders to address these
considerations and provide guidance, not only for sake of those interested in individualized ASO development,
but for other emerging gene-targeting therapeutic platforms that might be similarly individualized (e.g., genome
editing). The goal of this study is to develop and deliver empirically-informed guidance that addresses the
complex ELSI of individualized genomic medicine, and to chart a course that is just, fair, equitable, transparent,
and socially responsible. In Aim 1 we will conduct qualitative interviews with a diverse set of stakeholders: ASO
Site teams involved in the development of individualized therapies, Societal Issue experts (including leaders of
underserved communities), Parents of children with and without genetic conditions, Oversight experts without
n-of-1 ASO experience, and representatives of foundations and patient advocacy. In Aim 2, informed by our
experience and combined with domains and themes identified in Aim 1, we will combine a case-based
modified Delphi process, capped by a roundtable session to develop two tiered guidance for addressing the
ELSI challenges attendant to individualized therapy: 1) recommendations (“overall consensus”) and 2) points
to consider (key issues below the pre-determined threshold of “overall consensus”), along with a source
casebook. The two tiered guidance will inform evolving policies around the provision of individualized genomic
medicine for orphan diseases. Findings and recommendations will be broadly disseminated in a half-day
conference, as well as global professional meetings and in peer-reviewed journals."

Structural variants (SVs) have been associated with a wide range of cancers and Mendelian disorders, but
complexities associated with interpretation have slowed their adoption. It is still a challenge to determine which
SVs observed in a cancer patient are somatic and which SVs in a rare disease patient are pathogenetic. The
SV interpretation gap is especially stark when compared to the recent progress made with single nucleotide
variants (SNVs), which was driven by the release of large-scale population allele frequency estimates from
gnomAD. Given that variants that lead to cancer and rare disease should be rare in the general population, the
SNV allele frequency from 125 thousand samples is an extremely powerful metric. Allele frequency alone can
reduce the number of potentially pathogenic variants by two orders of magnitude. Unfortunately, there is no
equivalent resource for SV.
 There are high-quality SV call sets (SV VCFs) from large cohorts, but these static lists do not make
good allele frequency references. SV detection involves extensive filtering to reduce false positives, and
because filtering is never perfect, real SVs are inevitably removed making it difficult to draw a conclusion about
SVs that are in patients but not in VCF. The SV could be rare and absent from the population or could have
been filtered.
 We propose a new method (STIX) for SV characterization that dynamically searches the raw
alignments from thousands of genomes for evidence supporting a putative SV. From such a search we can
conclude that an SV with high-level evidence in many samples is likely to be a common variant and unlikely to
be somatic or pathogenic. With this method we show that many published somatic and de novo SVs are
actually present in reference populations, which implies that these variants are unlikely to cause disease. In
fact, STIX is as effective as using calls from a matched-normal sample at removing germline SVs from tumor
tissue calls. We also show that by relying on the raw signal, STIX recovers substantially more SVs from a
cohort than its corresponding SV VCF.
 In addition to large-scale SV searching, we propose a robust statistical framework for estimating SV
allele frequency and regional noise. We plan to make the searching technology and statics freely available for
nearly 30,000 genomes through a public web interface and integration with AnVIL. If funded, this project will
provide the means to accurately estimate SV population frequency by leveraging the data in tens of thousands
of genomes, which will greatly increase our ability to prioritize SVs in patients and pave the way toward
broader inclusion of SVs in medical genetics."

There is a strong scientific premise for the study of integrated substance use disorders (SUDs) and HIV-
prevention interventions for criminal justice-involved (CJI) populations. SUDs lead to increased rates of justice
involvement as well as increased risk for HIV-acquisition. Estimates of the proportion of the CJI-population with a
SUD reach 72%, and ~150,000 persons with HIV pass through a correctional facility annually. Although pre-
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), is a proven effective intervention for HIV-prevention, its maximal impact depends
on uptake, and adherence among those at high risk. To date, few published studies have examined PrEP uptake
among CJI populations. Our ongoing work with CJI women (San Francisco, CA) has identified high rates of risk
behaviors (including substance use), low levels of PrEP awareness, and high levels of interest in PrEP once
learning of it. Participants reported a strong interest in participating in a navigator-led intervention to screen and
link them to PrEP-related services; younger participants (i.e., those aged 18 to 29 years) were eager to
incorporate electronic health (eHealth) into navigation services. Navigator models use a one-on-one relationship
to promote the timely movement of an individual through a health care continuum by eliminating barriers and
have successfully increased healthcare access for CJI HIV-positive adults and individuals with SUDs. eHealth
approaches to SUD and HIV prevention also hold promise because they improve access to effective intervention
services, particularly for younger people. As a multidisciplinary team with expertise in behavioral health
(substance use and HIV prevention) among justice-involved populations, and eHealth supported and navigator-
led healthcare access and engagement interventions, we propose to develop and test an eHealth enhanced,
navigator-led substance use and HIV-prevention referral and linkage intervention for CJI-young adults. Study
aims are to: 1) Adapt an existing evidence-based navigator model (The Navigation Project) to incorporate
codeveloped eHealth technology, to refer and link CJI young adults (aged 18 to 29 years) to substance use
treatment and HIV-prevention services; 2) Refine and test the adapted, eHealth enhanced, navigator-led
substance use treatment and HIV prevention intervention for CJI-young adults for fidelity, satisfaction, and
appropriateness; 3) Assess the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of the adapted eHealth enhanced, navigator
program to refer and link CJI-young adults substance use treatment and HIV-prevention services. The proposed
study has the potential to: 1) reduce HIV-acquisition and improve access to substance use treatment among a
high-risk, underserved group of young adults in the US; 2) test the feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, effectiveness,
appropriateness, and satisfaction of implementing an eHealth enhanced, navigator-led substance use and HIV-
prevention intervention, and 3) create an intervention suitable for large-scale efficacy testing and translation to
other criminal justice settings."

Dormancy is a state in which virtually all intracellular activities, such as gene expression, are thought to have
(nearly) stopped. Many organisms and cells become dormant when they face dire conditions such as lack of
nutrients. Despite its ubiquity, the state of dormancy remains poorly understood and underexplored. A major
open question is which intracellular processes might still occur in dormancy, to what extent, and whether and
how they are important for surviving dormancy. This question is relevant to dormancy of microbial spores, cancer
cells, plant seeds, worms, cells in human body, and others. Microbial spores are particularly important because
many microbes in nature often exist as dormant spores rather than as vegetative cells. Many fungal spores are
of interest because they are infectious and are difficult to kill with existing drugs for unknown reasons.
 My laboratory's goal is to answer the critical question posed above for understanding dormancy. We use
the dormant yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) spores as a model system for studying eukaryotic dormancy.
With dormant yeast spores, we focus on two fundamental aspects of life:
(1) Dynamics and regulation of gene expression in dormancy
(2) Dynamics and determinants of aging in dormancy
 My lab makes quantitative measurements at single-cell and genome-wide levels and combines them with
mathematical models of gene regulations. We recently discovered that yeast spores express some genes while
dormant (i.e., in water without any nutrients) and that, surprisingly, some of the expression levels can be as high
as in vegetative yeasts. To extend this discovery, we adapted an RNA-Seq-based technique to detect all freshly
made RNAs in dormant yeast spores. We discovered that dormant yeast spores transcribe ~65% of their genes,
with ribosomal proteins being one of the most highly transcribed. With microscope-based techniques that detect
mRNA and protein productions in the same single spore and mathematical models that screen various forms of
gene regulation, we are now uncovering signs of globally (genome-wide) coordinated transcription and
translation whose mechanisms we aim to elucidate in the next five years. Our ongoing work is also uncovering
dormant yeast spores secreting molecules that help each other survive, extend lifespans, and regulate gene
expression. We will elucidate the mechanisms of this ""collective dormancy"" and signs of aging in dormant yeast
spores. A comprehensive library of gene-deleted yeast strains will help us determine how each gene accelerates
or decelerates aging in dormant spores and its role in collective dormancy. Our work will advance the still-
primitive understanding of eukaryotic, microbial dormancy by establishing foundational knowledge on gene
regulation and aging in dormancy with quantitative approaches that have rarely been applied to these topics.
More broadly, we expect that our work will provide conceptual insights into quiescent cells in general."

Rates of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and mortality continue to rise in the US and have
been exacerbated during the pandemic. The significant racial inequities in SMM and mortality
are a public health crisis and are a result of historical and contemporary structural and social
determinants including institutional and societal policies. Integrating a racial equity lens to
Medicaid policy interventions is a promising strategy for addressing the long-standing racial
inequities in SMM and broadly in maternal health. In the state of Pennsylvania, Medicaid is
implementing policy interventions that explicitly focus on Black populations. Three policy
interventions will be the focus of this study: the equity incentive payment program, the equity-
focused obstetric care bundled payment model and the reimbursement program for doula
services. These policy interventions are critical but will not successfully address racial inequities
without a multi-disciplinary, community engaged process that involves a constant critical
analysis for racial equity in the development and implementation of these policies. We will
conduct a multi-armed intervention study to assess the effects of the healthcare quality
interventions (equity incentive payment and equity-focused obstetric care bundle) and the
healthcare quality + doula care program vs. standard care. Because these interventions are
prospectively assigned to all PA Medicaid beneficiaries, we will compare within-state changes
pre-post interventions, as well as comparing changes in outcomes pre-post interventions among
PA Medicaid beneficiaries relative to Medicaid beneficiaries residing in similar states. Our
multidisciplinary team includes researchers and leaders across multiple academic institutions,
the Medicaid Research Center, Healthy Start Inc, the Pennsylvania Doula Commission and the
Maternity Care Coalition. Our study aims to: 1) estimate the effect of Medicaid healthcare quality
interventions on SMM, 2) estimate the effect of Medicaid healthcare quality interventions +
doula care, 3) Assess Medicaid beneficiaries’ experiences in receiving services and the
potential impact of integration of doula services and equity practices. Our central hypothesis is
that SMM rates will decline among Black populations after interventions relative to people of
other racial groups. This work will advance public health and health policy by implementing
innovative methods to engage with Medicaid beneficiaries who are affected by health equity
policies and provide quantitative estimates of the effects of health equity policy interventions on
outcomes among Black pregnant and parenting people. Results from this study will inform state
and federal health policymakers considering structural policy interventions within Medicaid as a
vehicle for addressing racial equity."
10888357,"Getting to Zero (GTZ) new HIV infections by 2030 is a public health priority. Increasing HIV prevention, self-
management, and harm reduction among at-risk populations is critical. HIV prevalence in sex workers is 12
times greater than the general population, highlighting the need for targeted prevention efforts. Increasing
optimal use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in this population will advance progress toward GTZ 2030.
Community empowerment interventions reduce HIV risk among sex workers because interventions are
collaboratively designed, implemented, and evaluated by the target population. A community-empowered PrEP
navigation approach may be feasible and acceptable among sex workers. One such approach is a group
healthcare model called Centering Healthcare (Centering), which originated as a group prenatal care model
and has since been modified for various patient populations. Centering's three core components: healthcare,
interactive learning, and community building, disrupt typical healthcare power hierarchies by creating a
respectful and collaborative interactive learning environment that honors group needs. The model's positive
impact links self-management goals and health assessment with interactive activities to foster health
promotion. Using an implementation science framework and building on Centering intervention
effectiveness, this study will be the first to evaluate whether Centering is feasible and acceptable for
PrEP education, navigation, and adherence among sex workers. Preliminary qualitative research with 39
sex workers in Chicago highlighted that stigma and healthcare discrimination dissuaded sex workers from
regularly accessing HIV prevention information, services, and treatment. In collaboration with sex workers and
a Community Advisory Board (CAB), we culturally adapted the Centering curriculum and facilitator's guide to
meet the stated needs of sex workers. Guided by an Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment
framework (EPIS), the overall goal of this study is to expand on my formative research and evaluate if this
culturally adapted Centering PrEP (C-PrEP+) model is feasible and acceptable for addressing education,
navigation and PrEP adherence needs of HIV negative sex workers in Chicago. Specific aims of this study are
to 1. Produce an implementation plan for integrating C-PrEP+ into a Federally Qualified Health Care (FQHC)
system. 2. Conduct a pilot feasibility and acceptability trial of C-PrEP+. 3. Complete an evaluation of C-PrEP+
to document implementation barriers and facilitators. The research plan will be augmented by expert mentoring
and didactic research training at University of Illinois Chicago and University of California San Francisco. This
proposal, mentoring, and coursework will provide essential career development in: 1. Quantitative methods, 2.
Health intervention study design, preparation, implementation, and 3. Mixed-methodological evaluation. This
foundation will uniquely position the PI to lead a fully powered multi-site RCT to determine if C-PrEP+ is an
efficacious and sustainable model to address HIV prevention among sex workers."

 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are often associated with human papillomavirus
(HPV) infection. The incidence of HPV+ HNSCC has been rapidly rising during the past 2-3 decades. Thus, it is
critical to gain better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of HPV+ HNSCCs in the context of immune
recognition and elucidate the mechanistic determinants underlying therapy responsiveness vs. resistance in
HPV+ HNSCC. The effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are highly heterogeneous in HNSCC patients;
however, it remains incompletely understood whether anti-HPV responses contribute to ICI efficacy. Recent
studies showed that HPV+ HNSCC responded better than HPV− HNSCC in a neoadjuvant anti-PD1 trial,
suggesting that effective HPV-related responses may benefit ICI treatment. The goal of this proposal is to
determine whether and how effective anti-HPV immune responses may contribute to ICI efficacy by testing if the
breadth and depth of T cell receptor (TCR) responses against HPV antigens affect the outcomes and therapy
responses of HPV+ HNSCC using human samples from clinical trials and murine HNSCC models.
 Prior studies focused on defined E7-derived peptides for HPV-related cellular therapy. However, HNSCC
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) contain much more HPV E2-reactive CD8 T cells than E7-reactive ones.
Hence, we will test TCRs against different HPV antigens (e.g., E6/E7 vs. E2) and elucidate the mechanistic
connection between HPV-specific TCRs and therapeutic responses. Our proposed studies may overcome the
barrier of the HNSCC field and develop a new toolbox of targeting HPV+ HNSCCs with maximal breadth and
depth of TCRs. We will employ a novel “window of opportunity” trial open at our institution (HCC 18-139) that
tests the effects of anti-PD1 (nivolumab) vs. anti-PD1 + anti-CTLA4 or anti-LAG-3 in a neoadjuvant setting before
surgery resection of locally advanced resectable HPV+ HNSCC. Additionally, we will employ a HNSCC mouse
model (mEER) expressing HPV16 E6/E7 antigen in which a small fraction of tumor-bearing recipients responded
to anti-PD-L1 treatment, allowing unambiguous identification of responders vs. non-responders. Using these
neoadjuvant trial samples, we will test whether anti-HPV immune responses underlie ICI responses and examine
whether HPV-reactive TCR clonal dynamics and T cell transcriptomics in TILs correlate with ICI responses. Our
mouse model allows functional validation of expanded HPV-reactive TCR clonotypes correlating with ICI
responses and permits antigen manipulation to enhance clinical responsiveness as well as lay the groundwork
for future clinical and targetable trials."
10878104,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 35% of individuals with hepatocellular cancer (HCC) are on the US waitlist for a liver transplant.
These patients initially had non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and progressed to HCC. Yet, signaling
mechanisms controlling cellular transformation from NASH to HCC are incompletely understood. Sirtuin 6
(SIRT6) is a protein deacetylase that limits the activity of lipogenic transcription factors. SIRT6 levels decrease
in human fatty liver disease and altered in cancer. SIRT6 also protects against liver fibrosis by inhibiting TGF-β
signaling via deacetylating SMAD2 and SMAD3. SMAD3, with its adaptor βII-spectrin (β2SP, encoded by the
SPTBN1 gene), activates SIRT6 transcription, providing a regulatory loop in fibrosis and fatty liver disease.
TGF-β induces fibrosis and promotes tumors, yet also has tumor suppressor functions that remain poorly
understood. We explored these paradoxes and identified β2SP as a critical regulator of TGF-β signaling and a
promoter of lipogenesis. In support of this observation, liver-specific knockout of β2SP (SPTBN1-LSKO)
protects mice from diet-induced fatty liver and HCC and blocks NASH in human microfluidic cultures.
Furthermore, we have identified in a human HCC a top “hit,” which reflected high expression of a β2SP
mutation, D1089Y, which impairs SMAD3 activity- providing functional insight into β2SP-SMAD3 interactions.
Based on these exciting findings, we hypothesize that disrupting the reciprocal regulation between SIRT6
and TGF-β signaling contributes to fatty liver disease, inflammation, and progression to HCC. We
further posit that β2SP plays a pivotal role in these events. If the regulatory network connecting SIRT6, β2SP,
and TGF-β signaling is impaired, lipid homeostasis and tumor suppression ability are compromised. In this
renewal, we advance these studies and investigate the role of β2SP, the effects of acetylation and
deacetylation, the functional consequences of D1089Y (β2SP) mutation, and the therapeutic efficacy of
targeting β2SP in steatosis and HCC with the following three specific aims.
AIM 1: We will examine how acetylation and SIRT6-mediated deacetylation regulate β2SP functions as a
partner for SREBP1 and SMAD3.
AIM 2: We will determine the functional effects of the HCC-associated mutation β2SP-D1089Y on SREBP1-
regulated lipogenesis and HCC in the context of steatosis in SIRT6 global and cell-specific knockout mice.
AIM 3: We will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting β2SP in the progression of steatosis and HCC in
SIRT6 global and cell-specific knockout mice.
Our studies aim to elucidate the central role of β2SP in the pathways involved in dysregulated lipogenesis and
hepatocyte transformation and provide a new molecular target for preventing obesity-driven cancer. Since
β2SP is critical in many human pathologies, including heart and neurogenerative diseases, our studies will
open new avenues of research by setting a precedent."

The ability of cancer cells to acquire resistance to anticancer drugs, resulting in eventual treatment failure, is
one of the most challenging problems in cancer therapy. Osimertinib (AZD89291), an EGFR mutation-selective
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), is FDA-approved for patients with EGFR mutant (EGFRm) NSCLC
that has become resistant to 1st generation EGFR-TKIs via T790M mutation and for EGFR mutation-positive
advanced NSCLC as front-line treatment. Despite promising clinical efficacy, acquired resistance inevitably
occurs to osimertinib, limiting its long-term clinical benefit. Thus, a thorough understanding of molecular
mechanisms accounting for the emergence of acquired resistance to osimertinib and other 3rd generation
EGFR-TKIs and the development of effective strategies to manage acquired resistance is an urgent and critical
area of unmet need in the clinic. Telomere maintenance via telomerase reactivation is directly linked to
uncontrolled cell growth and thus is a hallmark of cancer cells. While telomerase activity is silenced in most
human adult somatic or well-differentiated cells, it is reactivated in up to 90% of tumors. Thus, telomerase
represents an attractive target for highly selective cancer therapeutics. Intriguingly, we found that osimertinib-
treated human EGFRm NSCLC cell lines possess substantially reduced mRNA and protein levels of human
TERT (hTERT), a catalytic protein subunit of telomerase complex that determines its activity. In EGFRm
NSCLC cell lines with osimertinib acquired resistance, basal hTERT levels were elevated compared with their
parental cell lines and became insensitive to osimertinib modulation. hTERT elevation was also detected in the
majority of EGFRm NSCLC tissues relapsed from EGFR-TKI treatment. Knockdown of hTERT or chemical
inhibition of telomerase sensitized osimertinib-resistant cells to osimertinib. These preliminary data suggest a
critical role of hTERT/telomerase in modulating the responses of EGFRm NSCLC cells or tumors to osimertinib
or other 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs. Thus, we hypothesize that effective suppression of hTERT/telomerase is a
critical event in maintaining long-term therapeutic efficacy of osimertinib or other 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs in
the treatment of EGFRm NSCLCs. This hypothesis will be tested by accomplishing the following three aims: 1)
To understand the molecular mechanisms by which osimertinib suppresses hTERT expression in EGFRm
NSCLC cells; 2) To demonstrate the biological significance of hTERT/telomerase modulation in regulating the
responses of EGFRm NSCLC cells to osimertinib including development of acquired resistance; and 3) To
develop efficacious strategies for managing (delaying and overcoming) acquired resistance to osimertinib by
targeting hTERT/telomerase. The objectives of this proposal are to fully understand the mechanisms by which
osimertinib inhibits hTERT expression and telomerase activity, to demonstrate its critical role in mediating cell
response to osimertinib and other 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs including the acquired resistance, and to develop
effective therapeutic strategies to manage osimertinib acquired resistance by targeting hTERT/telomerase."
10878573,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
T cells are required for protection against intracellular infections such as leprosy and tuberculosis; however,
the specific mechanisms by which they contribute to host immunity remain unresolved. Leprosy, caused by the
intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium leprae (mLEP), provides an accessible model to investigate human
immune responses to intracellular bacterial infection. The spectrum of clinical manifestations of leprosy
correlates with the immune response to mLEP. Patients with tuberculoid leprosy (T-lep) develop protective
immunity and eliminate the infection, whereas those with lepromatous leprosy (L-lep) sustain a progressive
infection. The dynamics of T cell immunity can be studied in the context of the reversal reaction (RR), in which
patients upgrade from L-lep to T-lep. We established that in patients with leprosy, T cell subsets differ
dramatically between the blood and lesions, indicating the importance of studying the immune response at the
site of disease. During the first 38 years of this R01, we discovered new mechanisms by which CD4+ and CD8+
T cells engender antimicrobial activity against mLEP in infected human macrophages (MØs), which we also
showed to be relevant in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. These include 1) cytolytic T lymphocyte release
of the antimicrobial protein granulysin; 2) Th1 cell secretion of IFN- which activates vitamin D-dependent
induction of the antimicrobial proteins cathelicidin and DEFB4 in MØs; and 3) Th17 cell release of the
antimicrobial protein IL-26, which enters myeloid cells targeting intracellular bacteria. None of these
mechanisms exist in mice, necessitating the study of human disease. By integrating scRNA-seq and spatial
transcriptomics, we identified an ecosystem of T cells, MØs, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells
that together express 66 genes involved in the antimicrobial response in leprosy. We also discovered that
TREM2 MØs are a major MØ subpopulation in the disseminated L-lep form of leprosy, representing the mLEP-
infected foamy MØs that are unable to eliminate the pathogen. We hypothesize that T cell-dependent
antimicrobial mechanisms can overcome immune suppression in TREM2 MØs and thus eliminate mLEP. Our
specific aims are to: Aim 1: Elucidate the mechanisms by which T cells mediate an antimicrobial response to
intracellular mycobacteria, Aim 2: Define mechanisms by which TREM2 MØs contribute to the pathogenesis of
progressive infection in leprosy; and, Aim 3: Identify immune pathways that can augment antimicrobial
responses in leprosy, including in CD8+ T cells and TREM2 MØs. The proposed studies will provide insights
into the mechanisms of pathogenesis and host defense in intracellular bacterial infections."

Limb-salvage therapy has reduced the incidence of disfiguring amputations, however many sarcomas involve
crucial anatomical structures precluding this approach. Additionally, five year survival for metastatic sarcomas
is only 16%, underscoring the need for new therapeutic targets. The Hippo pathway is a highly conserved
serine/threonine kinase cascade which negatively regulates the TAZ and YAP transcriptional coactivators. TAZ
and YAP have emerged as important oncogenes in a number of cancers including breast, colon, liver, lung,
pancreas, and thyroid cancers. We have shown that TAZ/YAP are activated in the majority of sarcomas (66%),
however upstream mechanisms regulating TAZ and YAP are poorly understood, representing a significant gap
in knowledge. Our objective in this proposal is to dissect the signal transduction cascades that activate TAZ
and YAP in sarcomas. Our central hypothesis is that histone deacetylation of the regulatory regions of the core
Hippo kinases and MAP4 kinases works in tandem with PI3 kinase signaling to activate TAZ/YAP. This
hypothesis is supported by studies showing that loss of expression of the Hippo kinases is common in both
sarcoma clinical samples and cell lines as well as pharmacological studies showing that inhibition of histone
deacetylases (HDACs) lead to reconstitution of the Hippo kinases thus inhibiting TAZ/YAP. A parallel set of
studies utilizing genetically engineered and xenograft mouse models and sarcoma cell lines have shown that
TAZ and YAP differentially mediate PI3 kinase signaling in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and pediatric
rhabdomyosarcomas. We plan to test our central hypothesis with the following specific aims:
Aim 1) Identify how TAZ and YAP differentially contribute to PI3 kinase-mediated sarcomagenesis.
We will stimulate PI3K signaling in rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines that are wild-type, TAZ knockout, YAP
knockout, and TAZ/YAP knockout and determine how TAZ and YAP differentially contribute to the PI3 kinase
transcriptome by RNA-Seq gene expression analysis. We will also stimulate PI3K signaling in the muscle of
sarcoma-prone mice that are Trp53fl/flPtenfl/fl and that are Tazfl/flYapfl/fl, Tazfl/fl, Yapfl/fl, or Taz/Yap wild type and
compare tumor latency and gene expression profiles.
Aim 2) Determine if histone deacetylation of MST1/2 and the MAP4 kinases activates TAZ and YAP.
We will inhibit HDACs and assess occupancy of H3K27ac at promoter/enhancer regions of MST1/2 and the
MAP4 kinases (MM kinases) in rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. To test the importance of the MM kinases in
tumor progression in vivo, we will delete genes encoding the LATS1/2 kinases (that are downstream of the MM
kinases) in sarcoma-prone mice. To achieve this we will inject Trp53fl/fl mice that are Lats1fl/flLats2fl/fl or are
Lats1/Lats2 wild-type with intramuscular adeno-Cre virus.
Aim 3) Determine if inhibition of HDACs and the PI3K-Akt axis diminish proliferation and metastasis.
We will determine if combinatorial inhibition of histone deacetylases and the PI3 kinase pathway will inactivate
TAZ/YAP. This will be tested in vitro with proliferation and cell cycle analysis assays. The effect of combination
therapy on spontaneous metastases will be tested in a sarcoma xenograft mouse model.
 The proposal is innovative because it targets two incompletely understood parallel pathways upstream of
TAZ/YAP, expanding the focus of the field beyond targeting TAZ/YAP themselves, and thus addressing a
significant gap in knowledge. The project is significant because it identifies upstream pathways regulating
TAZ/YAP that can be inhibited pharmacologically, providing a mechanism to make therapeutic targeting of TAZ
and YAP clinically feasible for sarcomas and potentially other cancers."
10878206,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Allergies mainly occur in barrier tissues and are driven by the concerted action of the immune and nervous
systems. Following allergen sensitization, overt disease develops when allergen-primed immune effectors are
mobilized to promote inflammation at barrier tissues in response to allergen re-encounter. Barrier dysfunction
is central to the etiology of atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases. Loss of the barrier integrity not only
permits allergen penetration across the epithelial layer but also prompts a homeostatic-to-inflammatory shift in
epithelial gene expression. Inflammatory signals derived from epithelial cells of barrier-disrupted skin act on
nearby immune cells and nerve endings, dictating their dynamics and function. Skin colonization by
Staphylococcus aureus has emerged as an important feature of atopic dermatitis, yet it remains unclear
exactly how this bacterium contributes to the development of allergic skin disease. The central hypothesis for
the proposed research is that S. aureus colonization drives allergen sensitization and allergic inflammation by
causing skin barrier damage and triggering epithelial inflammatory signaling. Our preliminary data point to a
role for a protease derived from S. aureus in these pathologic processes. To verify this hypothesis, we will
pursue the following specific aims: to determine the role of staphylococcal proteolytic activity in skin barrier
disruption and percutaneous allergen sensitization (Aim #1); to establish the epithelial signaling pathways
linking staphylococcal protease action to the inflammatory gene expression program (Aim #2); and to elucidate
the contribution of staphylococcal protease-activated epithelial signaling to reshaping the skin neuroimmune
landscape and driving allergic skin inflammation (Aim #3). This research project will leverage the
complementary expertise of the participating investigators and technical support from well-established core
facilities. The goal of the proposed research is to decipher the molecular underpinnings of atopic dermatitis and
other diseases linked to barrier dysfunction and translate this knowledge into effective clinical strategies for
their treatment."
10878440,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cannabidiol (CBD) is now a legal, widely consumed, substance in the United States, but research regarding
CBD’s effects in healthy populations remains sparse. Although findings of studies conducted in both healthy
and clinical populations suggest that CBD may produce sedative effects, conclusions have been hampered by
small sample sizes and other methodological limitations. Given that sedation and drowsiness could ultimately
impair driving performance and increase drivers’ risk of motor vehicle collision, understanding the effects of
non-prescription CBD on driving performance and cognitive function in non-clinical populations is paramount.
However, only 3 studies involving 83 adults worldwide, have investigated CBD’s effects on driving performance
and each have methodological limitations. To close this research gap, a 5-year project is proposed to further
our understanding of whether and how CBD may impact driving performance by dose and biological sex in a
sample of young healthy adults using a driving simulator and a battery of well-validated self-report instruments
and cognitive tests. Our long-term goal is to definitively determine the effects of CBD on driving performance
and motor vehicle collision risk among all drivers. The specific aims of this project are 1) determine the
effects of CBD on the driving performance of healthy adults aged 18-30 years by dose and biological sex, 2)
determine the effects of CBD on participants’ drowsiness, sedation, and cognitive function by dose and
biological sex, and 3) determine whether changes in participants’ drowsiness, sedation, and cognitive function
are associated with driving performance. The research strategy will involve a randomized, parallel-group,
double-blind, sex-stratified, three-arm trial. Three hundred participants will be randomized to receive either: (1)
300 mg of pure CBD oil (N=100), (2) 150 mg of CBD oil (N=100) or (3) placebo oil (N=100) matched in
appearance and taste. After baseline cognitive testing, treatment consumption, and a 120-minute wait period,
each individual will then participate in a 40-minute driving simulation and re-take the cognitive tests. Our
central hypothesis is that, relative to placebo, increasing doses of CBD will be associated with greater
impairment in driving performance, as well as increased drowsiness and sedation, and a decline in cognitive
function. We also anticipate greater impairment in these outcomes among males vs. females based on our
pilot study results. Given that CBD products are growing in popularity at an exponential rate, and their effects
in a healthy population are virtually unknown, the potential impact of this study is the collection of essential
data regarding the unintended consequences of CBD, which may be unknowingly endangering the public by
impairing drivers and increasing collision risk. This aligns with the National Institutes of Health’s mission which
is to, “foster fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis
for ultimately protecting and improving health.”"

This project aims to investigate a novel approach to mitigate the risk of vascular thromboses, which imposes a
significant economic burden in the US. Our strategy is to develop a technology that, by specifically targeting the
lipid-binding domains of factor X (read factor ten) and prothrombin, two essential coagulation factors, regulates
the rate at which factor Xa and thrombin are produced and, consequently, controls the formation of blood clots.
This approach is unique compared to current pharmacologic methods that either directly (DOACs) or indirectly
(heparins) target the active site of clotting proteases or impair the proper synthesis of a family of proteins to
which multiple coagulation factors belong (warfarin). We propose this approach will offer potential benefits for
patients with prothrombotic antiphospholipid antibodies who experience limited effectiveness with existing
medications. Antiphospholipid antibodies are a defining feature of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is an
acquired autoimmune disorder. Additionally, there is evidence of their involvement in infectious diseases,
including COVID-19. By using an in vitro selection process, our preliminary studies identified a nanobody suitable
for testing this hypothesis, which we called NanoProTEN. Aim 1 of this project aims to investigate the biochemical
characteristics of NanoProTEN, including its affinity and specificity towards coagulation factors and plasma
proteins involved in the blood clotting cascade. We will then assess its anticoagulant potential in human plasma
and with purified coagulation factors, and its ability to interfere with antiphospholipid antibodies. These studies
will define the molecular interactions of NanoProTEN, evaluate its potential off-target effects, and establish its
anticoagulant potential compared to existing therapies. Studies in Aim 2 will define the unique mechanism of
action of NanoProTEN through structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy. By determining the structures
of NanoProTEN bound to prothrombin and factor X, we will uncover the structural elements contributing to its
dual selectivity. These studies will determine how NanoProTEN interacts with these factors, offering mechanistic
insights into its mode of action and providing essential information for enhancing its activity. In conclusion, the
primary outcome of this research project is the development of an innovative technology represented by
NanoProTEN. This technology holds promise as a versatile research tool and a potential candidate for a new
class of anticoagulants for improving outcomes in patients with prothrombotic autoantibodies and potentially
other thrombotic disorders."

Lumbar spine surgery for degenerative disease is one of the most common and most expensive surgeries
performed in the United States. However, there is substantial variation in lumbar surgery rates, approaches,
and patient-reported outcomes at the surgeon, hospital, and regional levels. One major cause of these
inconsistencies is the lack of evidence-based tools to both predict outcome and personalize treatment
recommendations. For example, while there has been growing recognition that pain symptoms reflect a
complex interplay of biochemical, psychological, and social factors that influence surgical outcomes, these
factors are not typically incorporated into surgical treatment plans. One important factor preventing the
expansion of evidence-based treatments, particularly related to behavioral and cognitive interventions, is a lack
of precision tools to measure dynamic symptom profiles for pain and related psychosocial comorbidities. In
particular, traditional patient assessments use cross-sectional (i.e., one-time) questionnaires that are subject to
recall bias and fail to capture longitudinal symptom dynamics. Mobile health (mHealth) technology has enabled
a fundamentally new approach to collect intensive longitudinal patient-reported and biometric data to support
individualized decision-making. In particular, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is an emerging tool that
leverages brief mobile surveys to obtain momentary, longitudinal assessments of core disease constructs.
Complementing EMA, mobile fitness trackers, such as Fitbit, passively collect biometric data (e.g., activity,
heart-rate, and sleep) that reflect the physiologic manifestations of lumbar spine-related disability and impaired
psychosocial health. These innovative tools may provide a newfound ability to capture important
biopsychosocial features that impact surgical outcome. Recognizing these evidence gaps and the value of
emerging mHealth technology, this study’s overall objective is to establish the utility of using real-time
patient-reported and biometric data to prognosticate and stratify lumbar spine patients, and to establish the
value proposition for implementing these methods. This objective will be accomplished through the following
Aims. In Aim 1 I will investigate the ability of mHealth assessments to identify novel disease features with
prognostic importance for degenerative lumbar spine surgery patients. In Aim 2, I will use real-time mHealth
assessments to identify novel phenotypes of lumbar disease. In Aim 3, I will define the value proposition and
implementation context for using mHealth assessments to address functional and psychosocial influences on
lumbar surgery outcomes. These research activities will be combined with a rigorous mentored training
program incorporating chronic pain research, machine learning, behavioral intervention development, and
implementation science. At the completion of this award, I will be prepared to submit an R01 application
integrating data analytics, implementation science, and the biopsychosocial model of pain to test interventions
to improve lumbar spine surgery outcomes."

Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive scarring disease with limited therapeutic options. Fibrotic
lung diseases are characterized by an accumulation of excess extracellular matrix (ECM), contributing to the
destruction of lung architecture, inability to perform gas exchange, and even death. My mentor published
pioneering work that IPF patients have abnormally high levels of lactate in their lungs. Lactate in turn decreases
the local pH, which activates latent TGFβ, resulting in a pro-fibrotic feed-forward loop that drives fibrosis and
dysregulated metabolism. We and others have demonstrated that increased tissue stiffness in lung fibrosis also
drives fibroblast differentiation, expression of matrix proteins, and cross-linking, resulting in further increases in
tissue stiffness. While tissue stiffness and altered lactate metabolism are independently recognized as
pathogenic pathways and potential therapeutic targets, I have now identified the mechanoreceptor Piezo2 as a
potential link between altered tissue mechanics and aberrant metabolism. In this revised project application, I
will use patient-derived non-fibrotic and IPF lung fibroblasts to characterize the mechanism by which Piezo2
drives metabolic adaptations in response to increased matrix stiffness, and how these metabolic adaptations
contribute to a feed-forward loop that drives fibrosis. I will also use well-characterized pre-clinical mouse models
of pulmonary fibrosis to investigate the role of Piezo2 in vivo using genetic knockdown and pharmaceutical
inhibition approaches. To further support the clinical relevance of my results, the metabolic adaptations identified
in the cell culture and mouse models will be compared with my new evidence of metabolic disruptions in the
lungs of IPF patients obtained by metabolomics analysis of exhaled breath condensate. This project will support
my career goal to transition to a tenure-track faculty position as an independent investigator. To complete my
technical training needs for this project, I will work with my co-mentor Dr. L. Ashley Cowart to participate in
extensive hands-on training in metabolomics data analysis, as well as attend training courses at the highly
regarded West Coast Metabolomics Center at UC Davis. My co-mentor Dr. Patricia Sime will guide me in my
professional development as an independent scientist by providing additional training opportunities in
translational research, grant writing and scientific communication, lab management and administration, teaching,
and mentoring others. I have established a strong mentor committee and strong relationships with internal and
external collaborators. Virginia Commonwealth University is a highly productive scientific environment and is
very supportive of my development as an independent scientist. My training and research experience under this
career development award will yield novel insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis, giving
me foundational skills and my own research project to carry me into independence."
10887120,"Summary
Clinically, AOM is the leading reason for pediatrician visits and antibiotic usage by children. The
predominant causative agents of AOM are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus
influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. While currently licensed capsule-based vaccines have
dramatically lowered in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease, the incidence of
mucosal infections such as AOM has remained relatively unchanged. Likewise, non-typeable H.
influenzae currently predominates the AOM landscape following introduction of the Hib vaccine.
Additionally complicating matters is the potential concern that a vaccine targeting an individual
otopathogen may not reduce overall incidence of AOM due to the non-targeted pathogens
becoming more predominant following the removal of an individual pathogen. We have
engineered a safe, effective, and highly manipulatable platform for delivering protein epitopes to
the mucosal surface to target multiple otopathogens simultaneously while engendering
protective immunity at the mucosal surface. Leveraging a combinatorial approach for eliminating
multiple AOM pathogen simultaneously using a live vaccine platform to maximize mucosal
antibody responses represents a novel strategy for reducing the burden of AOM in children."
10834040,"Personalized medicine will greatly improve the effectiveness of cancer care; however, the development of practically attainable patient-specific strategies has remained challenging. One unique opportunity exists with B cell-derived malignancies, which often express surface immunoglobulins (sIgs) with variable regions (idiotypes, Ids) within their B-cell receptors (BCRs). As malignant cells originate from a single clone, such sIg-Id molecules are specific to the tumor and unique to each patient. Targeting sIg-Ids can hence enable personalized disease identification and treatment strategies. Early studies using patient-specific anti-sIg-Id antibodies yielded promising results but were deemed unsustainable. A technology to generate personalized ligands in a time-efficient and cost-effective manner remains an unmet need in sIg-Id-based diagnostics and therapeutics. 
Aptamers, i.e., single-stranded oligonucleotides that specifically bind to biological targets, offer an attractive solution to this unmet need. Aptamers are isolated from a randomized oligonucleotide library via an in vitro process known as SELEX, which is traditionally labor-intensive, time-consuming (up to a month), and impractical for personalized aptamer generation. In contrast, we have developed a microfluidic platform, called microSELEX (μSELEX), which has been used to isolate aptamers for protein biomarkers, including Id regions of monoclonal antibodies from patients with multiple myeloma and COVID-19. Given a monoclonal protein from a patient sample, the platform is capable of rapidly isolating personalized anti-Id aptamers within ~10 hours. 
We propose to explore time-efficient and cost-effective μSELEX isolation of patient-specific DNA aptamers targeting sIg-Ids of tumor B cells for B-cell hematologic malignancies. We will first establish an optimal μSELEX protocol using B cell-derived cell lines, then isolate anti-sIg aptamers against tumor B cells obtained from peripheral blood samples of B cell lymphoma patients, and finally demonstrate noninvasive peripheral blood-based monitoring of minimal residual disease by using the aptamers to detect circulating tumor B cells. 
In addition to enabling timely identification of minimal residual disease for more precise clinical decision making, anti-sIg-Id aptamers can also be used as therapeutic ligands to enable personalized and precisely targeted therapy for more effective disease treatment. Such personalized aptamers can hence potentially lead to transformative changes in the care of patients with B-cell hematologic malignancies."

The Data Analysis Core (DAC) of the HuBMAP Pregnant Female Reproductive Tissue Mapping Center (PFR
TMC) will perform analysis of each data type generated by the Organ Specific Project (OSP), as well as
integrative analysis of multiple data types aimed at building 3D multiscale tissue maps of the developing and
term pregnant placenta, and term uterine endomyometrium and fallopian tubes; exploration of extracellular RNA-
mediated signaling between the placental and maternal tissues; and tracking of cellular differentiation and
migration in the developing placenta across gestation. These integrative analyses will be facilitated by two
strategies: 1) collection of bridging datasets (datasets that link two data types, such as the 10x Multi-ome assay,
which collects snRNAseq/snATACseq indexed to the same nuclei, or GeoMX DSP WTA, in which the operator
uses tissue morphology and immunohistochemistry to select features for spatial transcriptomic profiling, thus
linking morphology and/or protein expression with transcript abundance); and 2) combining broad surveys of
small numbers of samples for many samples with deep spatial profiling of multiple serial sections from selected
exemplar tissue blocks to build detailed models of tissue architecture. The DAC will collaborate with the HuBMAP
Integration, Visualization & Engagement Collaboratory (HIVE) to build an atlas of 3D tissue maps in the context
of the whole human body. The DAC is responsible for data processing, annotation, metadata curation, analysis,
and map construction within the PFR TMC. The DAC interacts closely with the OSP and coordinates interactions
with the other HuBMAP TMCs, HIVE and NIH Program staff. The DAC ensures that data, metadata, software
and tools will be open, findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR) and maintains flexibility to adapt
processing and analysis capabilities to emerging technologies within the HuBMAP Consortium. The DAC has
assembled a PFR TMC Data Release Team comprised of experts in each of the included data modalities that
interfaces directly with the HIVE to ensure data quality control, metadata standards and facilitate data transfer.
The DAC collaborates closely with the HIVE to optimize secondary analysis pipelines and to implement the
Registration User Interface to register tissue sections to reference organs and a Common Coordinate Framework
to fully integrate spatial and molecular data across individuals. Since the establishment of the PFR TMC 15
months ago, the DAC has been involved in development of Consortium-wide metadata standards, data quality
metrics, analysis techniques and data structures, particular in the areas touching upon the specific data and
tissue types utilized by the PFR TMC."

There is a critical need for training junior investigators to conduct high quality research focused on the needs of older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and other serious illness and their families. This proposal for the Research Education Component (REC) program of our Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) aims to develop research leaders through creation of a dedicated program of academic and research development for junior investigators in the field of geriatrics and palliative care. The ultimate goal of the REC is to provide a strong foundation in the fundamentals of research for older adults with ADRD and other serious illness to put these investigators on a path to obtaining external funding and ultimately become successful independent researchers. In this proposal we have outlined a detailed plan to recruit talented, junior investigators (faculty or research fellows) from different disciplines and provide them advanced training in research methodology, a plan for individualized career development, a relationship with an experienced mentoring team, and funds to support an original research project focused on older adults with ADRD or other serious illness. Candidates for this core include those junior investigators who are immediately out of training and are starting a research path or are career switching from a predominately clinical career track to research (very early investigators); those investigators in the “pre-K” stage who are preparing for or are in the process of submitting an NIH or foundation career development award; and those individuals who are transitioning off a career development award and need additional support as they apply for an R01 grant or equivalent mechanisms (“K to R”). The curriculum for the REC scholars consists of two core elements, designed to leverage OAIC and institutional resources while avoiding having to duplicate coursework: 1) a core curriculum in research design, methods and statistics currently offered by the Graduate School at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) and 2) curriculum addressing research elements related to geriatrics and palliative care led by OAIC faculty including new initiatives and collaborations for training in dementia-focused research. Training and weekly mentoring will occur in a variety of venues and will include clear roles and responsibilities for REC scholars and mentors alike. We have incorporated the use of individualized development plans and project tracking grids that infuse a spirit of accountability and provide a structure for monitoring progress. Regular and rigorous evaluation of the scholars as well as the program is in place. Oversight assures that the core’s co-leaders interact on a regular basis with our OAIC’s Leadership and Administrative Core and the Executive Committee to assure that the REC is successful. In addition we have created a REC Advisory Committee that will work with the REC leaders to assure that the core operates smoothly and efficiently to create a group of well-supported junior investigators dedicated to improving the care of older adults with ADRD and other serious illness and their families."

The goal of the OSP is to generate the data needed to build three-dimensional multiscale maps of the human
placenta from healthy uncomplicated pregnancies. OSP1 will interact with the OAC and DAC, as well as other
HuBMAP Centers, to facilitate data and resource sharing across the Consortium and with the broader scientific
community. The placenta is the interface between mother and fetus, mediating exchange of nutrients and
metabolic wastes and producing endocrine signals that promote maintenance of the pregnancy and proper
fetal growth. The placenta is comprised largely of cells of fetal origin, including stromal cells, capillary
endothelial cells, and three types of trophoblast: proliferative cytotrophoblast; hormone-producing and
transport-mediating syncytiotrophoblast; and invasive extravillous trophoblast. The placenta also contains fetal
and maternal immune cells, which mediate immunologic responses to infection and may play roles in placental
development. Abnormalities in placental development and function have been linked to the most common and
serious complications of pregnancy, but details of the mechanisms leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes
remain to be elucidated. The complementary strengths of our investigative team enable us to obtain prenatal in
vivo MRI and ultrasound imaging data and post-delivery molecular profiling data from the same organs.
Rigorous pre-analytical and characterization pipelines will ensure collection of high-quality biospecimens and
generation of reproducible data. A range of advanced molecular profiling techniques will be used, including
bulk and single-nucleus transcriptomic, chromatin accessibility, and extracellular matrix proteomic profiling, and
high-resolution multiplexed spatial transcriptomic and imaging mass cytometry technologies. We will combine a
survey approach (in which we will collect data from a small number of samples/sections from many subjects,
which will allow us to detect potential differences associated with variables such as fetal sex, mode of delivery,
or maternal factors) with a deep dive approach (in which we will collect data from many serial sections from a
small number tissue blocks, to build a detailed model of tissue architecture). To generate foundational
knowledge to serve as the basis of future studies aimed at identifying the structural and functional
perturbations that underlie placental dysfunction-mediated pregnancy complications, we propose two Sub-
Aims: C.1. To generate a reference dataset from normal term placentas, uterine endomyometrium, fallopian
tubes, and maternal serum, to enable construction of 3D multiscale maps of these normal pregnant
reproductive tissues at term, and to map extracellular RNA-mediated signaling between the placenta and
maternal tissues; and C.2. To generate a reference dataset from placentas across gestation, to enable
construction of 3D multiscale maps of the developing human placenta, and tracking of the differentiation and
migration of the cells within it."
10871850,"Abstract
Asian American women experience more favorable cancer survival than other US racial/ethnic groups, even
after accounting for known prognostic indicators. Breast cancer, which follows this pattern, is a useful model for
understanding factors contributing to this intriguing survival advantage, given that it is the most common
cancer in Asian American women, and has established clinical, biological/genetic, and lifestyle prognostic
factors. Thus, studying the breast cancer survival advantage in Asian American women has the potential to
identify protective factors that may benefit all patients. We propose to investigate multilevel factors (health
behaviors and contextual factors, clinical characteristics, treatment, and tumor immune response) in relation to
overall and breast cancer-specific mortality in Asian American breast cancer cases. However, the Asian
American population is heterogeneous, with lifestyle factors and disease risks (e.g., breast cancer survival
rates) varying by specific ethnicity and by immigration status. Many studies have shown the importance of
population disaggregation to uncovering meaningful differences among Asian American ethnic groups, but no
single study to date includes adequate Asian American ethnic group population samples. To overcome this
limitation, we will conduct the proposed research in integrated data and biospecimens from four established
cohort studies enriched with Asian American breast cancer cases. These studies together include 4,219 Asian
American patients (1,848 Chinese, 602 Japanese, 1,538 Filipinas) and 5,386 non-Latina White women with
breast cancer as a comparison group. In Specific Aim 1, we will assess contributions of individual-level lifestyle
and health behaviors and multilevel neighborhood social context and sociocultural factors to survival
differences among the Asian American ethnic groups relative to non-Latina Whites. In Specific Aim 2, we will
evaluate how specific treatment factors impact survival for 4,373 Asian Americans compared to 4,373 non-
Latina Whites, taking advantage of electronic health record data from an equal-access healthcare system. In
Specific Aim 3, we will characterize the immune infiltrates in the breast tumor microenvironment from 1,200
Asian American (from Aim 1) and 714 non-Latina White (from TCGA) patients using immunogenomic profiling,
and to determine the associations of immune phenotypes with patient survival among Asian Americans and
with exposure factors from Aim 1. Thus, using existing resources, this study will comprehensively assess
factors including health behaviors and neighborhood context, lifestyle, treatment, tumor immuno-biology, and
their contributions to the survival advantage in Asian American women. The proposed study makes efficient
use of data from numerous breast cancer studies to gain insight for strategies that may advance knowledge
about the management of breast cancer for all women."

Specific Aim 1: To prepare a cadre of well-trained translational researchers by creating and periodically
reviewing research career development plans to ensure they are individualized, comprehensive, and goal-
oriented.
Specific Aim 2: To prepare trainees for a team science-based research career by exposing them to diverse
training experiences and linking each scholar to a comprehensive mentoring team.
Specific Aim 3: To increase the number of under-represented minority researchers by increasing the diversity
of the selection and mentoring teams and the applicant pool.
 The program is designed to accelerate the translation of basic science discoveries into clinical care and
improvements in population health by preparing a qualified clinical and translational research workforce. The
program provides early-stage investigators with research training, funds and time to engage in inter-professional
educational opportunities and opportunities to learn multidisciplinary team skills by engaging with experienced
investigators from different disciplines. The program integrates team science into trainees’ research development
by imbedding trainees as active members of multidisciplinary research teams that include clinical and basic
science investigators. Scholars are supported either by NIH funds (KL2) or local institutional funds.
 Thus far, the evaluation of the program has been measured by its impact on the research productivity
and career trajectories of trainees. To date, 26 scholars have been recruited into the program, including 23
scholars who have completed training in the program and 3 current trainees selected last year. Of this group, 18
of 23 graduates have received funding beyond their KL2. Between 2014-2018, KL2 graduates published 50
manuscripts, were awarded 33 grants totaling $8,748,110, and received 17 awards and honors. Progression of
scholars through the ranks of academic medicine is clear with 13 having been promoted to Associate or Full
Professor. In addition, scholars have taken leadership roles including two as Department Chairs, one Interim
Chair, two as Division Chiefs and one as Medical Director."
10871852,"Project Summary
This proposal represents the continuation of our long-running program to understand the biology of polyamine
metabolism in the trypanosomatid parasites and to exploit the pathway for drug discovery. Trypanosomatids
are the causative agents of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), Leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, all of
which are listed by the WHO as neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Collectively 18-20 million people are
infected with one of these parasites, yet drug therapies remain inadequate for all three diseases. Polyamines
are small organic polycations that are synthesized from L-ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine. In eukaryotes,
the polyamine spermidine is absolutely essential for growth due to its role as a substrate for the hypusine
modification of the translation factor eIF5A. Eflornithine, which inhibits the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme
ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), is a frontline therapy for the treatment of HAT. Interest in understanding the
biology and regulatory mechanisms of this pathway led to the finding that, while the trypanosomatids share in
common the essential role for hypusination, they have evolved both unique polyamine-containing metabolites
and their own regulatory strategies in comparison to other eukaryotic cells. This includes our discovery that two
of the biosynthetic enzymes S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) and deoxyhypusine synthase
(DHS) each require oligomerization with inactive pseudoenzmes for activity. Despite significant understanding
of the metabolism and biological roles of polyamines in trypanosomatids, a number of key questions remain
unexplored and are the subject of this proposal. In Aim 1, we plan studies to build on our observation that the
AdoMetDC pseudoenzyme (termed prozyme) is translationally regulated in response to perturbations that
reduce levels of the product decarboxylated AdoMet, suggesting dcAdoMet functions as a novel metabolic
signal for regulation of the polyamine pathway. In Aim 2, we will focus on unexplored metabolic pathways and
functional roles of the upstream polyamine metabolites L-Orn and Put. Our questions are: does Put play
additional roles beyond its requirement as a precursor for Spd synthesis; and can T. brucei synthesize L-Orn
using an uncharacterized amidinotransferase. In Aim 3, we will study the function and composition of enzymes
(DHS and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH)) required to modify eIF5A with the hypusine cofactor. Our
approaches will be a combination of genetic strategies and pharmacologic tools to perturb cell metabolism, state
of the art metabolomics, genomic strategies to identify candidate genes, and biochemistry (protein expression,
enzyme assay and crystallography). While our work will focus on T. brucei, the unusual metabolic features of
this pathway have been found in all three pathogenic trypanosomatids, so it is likely that the discoveries we
make in T. brucei will translate to T. cruzi and Leishmania. Finally, while our past grant also focused primarily
on biological discovery, the results from our work laid the foundation for us to spin off two separate drug
discovery programs targeting the trypanosomatids."

 Endothelial cells (ECs) are key components of both blood and lymphatic vessels, and aberrant EC
proliferation due to abnormalities in various signaling pathways contributes to a wide range of vascular anomalies
including vascular malformation and tumors. Lymphatic malformation (LM) and lymphangiosarcoma (LAS) are
vascular anomalies originating from lymphatic ECs. While LM mostly remains as a benign disease, a fraction of
LM patients progress to the highly aggressive and deadly LAS. Although LM (e.g. chronic lymphedema in breast
cancer patients) has been recognized as a risk factor for LAS, very little is known about underlying mechanisms
regulating the progression of LM to LAS. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to understand the
molecular and cellular mechanisms of LM progression to LAS in order to develop new strategies for effective
prevention and treatment of this deadly disease. In prior funding periods, we developed a mouse model with
inducible EC-specific deletion of Tsc1 tumor suppressor gene (Tsc1iΔEC mice), which recapitulates salient
features of human LAS. Using a new tumor cell line derived from Tsc1iΔEC mice, we further showed that
autophagy blockade by knockout or knockdown of different autophagy genes inhibited vascular tumor cell
proliferation in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Transcriptional profiling and additional mechanistic analysis
suggested a role for the autophagy-dependent expression of osteopontin and its potential autocrine stimulation
of Jak/Stat3 signaling in promoting tumor cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. More importantly, by generating
EC-specific double conditional knockout of an essential autophagy gene Fip200 in Tsc1iΔEC model, we found that
autophagy inhibition, while not affecting the initial LM development, blocked LM progression to LAS. We also
prepared a new Tsc1/Fip200-4A double conditional knockin mouse for further analysis of the mechanisms of
regulation of LM progression to LAS by FIP200-mediated autophagy in vivo. In addition, we performed a genome-
wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identified several genes with tumor suppressive functions for vascular tumor
growth in vivo, including Rasa1 encoding a negative regulator of Ras signaling, suggesting potential synergy
between Ras/MAPK and mTORC1 signaling in LM development and progression to LAS. Based on these strong
supporting data and using our unique mouse and cell models, we propose to 1) determine the mechanisms of
autophagy regulation of vascular tumor cell proliferation and tumorigenicity; 2) examine targeting of autophagy
and its downstream pathways to block LM progression to LAS; and 3) explore the potential synergy between
Ras and mTORC1 signaling in the development and progression of vascular tumors. Together, these studies
will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of LM progression to LAS,
that may contribute to the future design of effective prevention and novel therapies for this devastating disease."
10871818,"Patients with end-stage heart failure (HF) require mechanical circulatory support, and if eligible, heart
transplantation (HTx). The supply of donor hearts has reached a plateau since the only current source of donor
hearts consists of patients with irreversible complete brain damage (donation after brain death, DBD). However,
the number of eligible HT recipients increased exponentially. Unfortunately, due to this demand-supply
mismatch, up to 20% of patients die while listed for HTx. Thus, there is an urgent need to expand the heart donor
pool. A potential new source of such donor hearts is from DCD (donation after circulatory death) donors. DCD
donors have increased the transplantation rates of solid organs, including liver, lungs and kidney, by 50%.
Unfortunately, DCD protocol induces a sustained warm ischemic time that damages the myocardium precluding
its use for clinical transplantation. Thus, the ischemia (ISC) from DCD protocol, the potential myocardial injury
from storage, and reperfusion (REP) associated injury combine to represent additional risks to exacerbate injury
in the DCD heart, precluding their routine use in clinical transplantation. A limited number of HTx are performed
utilizing DCD hearts under strict protocol with very short ischemia times (<20 minutes). Extending the acceptable
ischemia time (35 minutes) will allow significant additional DCD hearts to be utilized for HTx. Although the warm
ISC is inevitable in DCD hearts, REP injury can be decreased through interventions applied at the onset of
REP. We propose that the development of new strategies to prevent REP injury will reduce damage to the DCD
heart. Mitochondria are critical targets and mediators of cardiac injury during REP. Mitochondrial permeability
transition pore (MPTP) opening is considered a final step to induce cell death during ISC-REP. Since MPTP
opening predominantly occurs during REP, there is a window of opportunity to decrease MPTP opening by
applying intervention at the onset of REP. Cyclosporine A (CyA) is a classic MPTP inhibitor that decreases
cardiac injury in hearts following ISC-REP. We propose that administration of the CyA at the onset of REP can
reduce cardiac injury in the DCD hearts. Calpain1 and 2 (CPN1/2) are calcium-dependent proteases that are
activated during ISC-REP. Activation of CPN1/2 impairs cardiac function by degrading structural proteins,
including spectrin and junctophilin-2 (JPH2). Activation of CPN1/2 also contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction
during ISC-REP. In addition, activation of CPN1/2 increases inflammation by cleaving and activating caspase-1.
Therefore, we will test if the administration of CPN1/2 inhibitor (MDL-28170, MDL) can decrease cardiac injury
in DCD hearts. We will further test if the combined treatment with CyA and MDL can provide additional protection
compared to individual CyA or MDL treatment in DCD hearts, especially with a longer ischemia period. Aim 1
will evaluate the MPTP opening and CPN1/2 activation in rat DCD hearts, especially with a longer period of ISC.
We will further study if REP after DCD hearts with a prolonged period of ISC further increases MPTP opening
and CPN1/2 activation. Aim 2 will study the effectiveness of CyA or MDL treatment in decreasing cardiac injury
in DCD hearts individually and in combination with a prolonged period of ISC. Aim 3 will study the protective
effect of CyA or MDL in heterotopic transplanted rat hearts with a longer duration of follow-up (2 weeks). To
establish the translation potential of our work, we will test the benefits of CyA and MDL in a DCD pig heart auto-
transplantation model. Our planned experiments and the anticipated results will increase DCD hearts' availability
for HTx even with longer periods of ISC-REP. Using an integrated treatment approach as proposed, we aim to
move towards using DCD hearts for clinical transplantation."
10869327,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neuronal damage in glaucoma occurs following pathologic mechanical strains and fibrosis of
the optic nerve head (ONH). Despite an abundance of evidence implicating mechanical strain
and matrix fibrosis in glaucomatous damage, it is not known to what extent and how ONH cells
signal to each other to produce matrix fibrosis in response to mechanical strains. This is due, in
part, to a lack of adequate model systems to test mechanisms of matrix fibrosis following
mechanical strain. In this exploratory R21, we propose to overcome limitations of existing
models by establishing an in vitro 3D culture system that (a) accounts for native tissue stiffness,
(b) permits dynamic matrix remodeling, (c) includes human ONH astrocytes and lamina cribrosa
(LC) cells, and (d) allows for targeted manipulation of cell type-specific molecular pathways. We
will then use this system to examine fibrotic signaling pathways between ONH astrocytes and
LC cells in response to mechanical strain. Specifically, our preliminary data have identified the
extra domain A isoform of fibronectin (FN+EDA) – Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling axis as
critical to matrix deposition by ONH cells. We will use our model system to test the role of the
FN+EDA-TLR4 signaling axis in mechanical strain-induced matrix fibrosis. The experiments
proposed in this R21 will advance our understanding of ONH mechanobiology by (i)
investigating whether crosstalk between ONH astrocytes and LC cells is critical to
mechanodysfunction, (ii) establishing quantitative models to test mechanisms of mechanical
strain-induced matrix fibrosis, and (iii) investigating the potential of ONH matrix proteins to act
as key signaling molecules to enhance ONH fibrosis. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1, Generate quantitative models of the fibrotic response of human ONH astrocytes and LC
cells after mechanical strain, in monocultures and co-cultures.
Aim 2, Test whether astrocyte-derived FN+EDA stimulation of LC cell TLR4 promotes
mechanical strain-induced matrix fibrosis.

underprepared. Multiple studies have confirmed that students lack competency in this domain, having difficulty
performing and interpreting the results of MSK examinations, leading to reduced patient outcomes.
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the creation and availability of a new simulation system can address this
problem by supporting enhanced learning interactions and increasing knowledge transfer for clinical education.
Specific Aims: A Fast-Track project is proposed where the Phase I aims will be to: 1) Consult with expert
advisory panel and perform final independent evaluation, 2) Prototype knee joint mannequin
materials/mechanical design, and 3) Develop simulation electronics and functionality. If the Phase I meets its
transition criteria of success the follow-on Phase II program will: 1) Collect expert feedback on design and
educational utility, 2) Perform additional skeletal/joint engineering and implement a suite of simulation curricula,
and 3) Validate the system utility through human subject testing and expert evaluation."

This proposal seeks support to develop novel data integration methods using electronic health records (EHR)
from multiple CTSA hubs to create predictive models of multi-system diseases. The proposed project directly
addresses the areas of emphasis in PAR-19-099 to “engage new collaborators in pre-existing collaborations to
solve a translational science problem no one hub can solve alone”.
Research gap: The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop the Predictive Analytics via Networked
Distributed Algorithms (PANDA) framework, which will enable accurate risk prediction to help healthcare
providers reach accurate diagnoses earlier. Our proposed methods directly address two major barriers: 1) lack
of predictive models for multi-system conditions; 2) lack of algorithms that effectively combine data from
multiple sites in a privacy-preserving and communication-efficient fashion.
In this proposal, we will develop and evaluate the PANDA framework using two prototypic multi-system
conditions, with different levels of prevalence: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, a type of vasculitis,
prevalence of 74 per million) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) (1500 per million), with the expectation that the
approach will be readily applicable to other diseases. These two conditions are particularly well-suited to the
development of our predictive methods given the commonly encountered delays in diagnosis that can range
from months to years. These delays may be associated with high morbidity and early mortality. We have
three Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Develop predictive models for granulomatosis with polyangiitis and psoriatic arthritis, and data
 integration algorithms to enable secure and efficient data sharing among multiple institutions.
Aim 2. Test the predictive models from Aim 1 using aggregated data (not IPD) from a separate set of
 CTSA sites to validate the data integration methodology.
Aim 3. Develop a “toolbox” of resources through which the PANDA processes of algorithm generation
 and data aggregation can be easily shared with and adopted for use by all CTSAs and others.
The success of this project will lead to novel analytic tools for facilitating efficient and privacy-preserving data
sharing and collaborative risk predictions across CTSA sites. The PANDA process of novel analytic tools to
assist clinical diagnoses and interventions should then be studied through pragmatic trials to evaluate its
potential to decrease diagnostic delays and alter patients’ health trajectories. This project is highly feasible and
is potentially transformative for both data science and clinical medicine."

Despite significant advances in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) therapy, 25% of patients relapse.
Recent evidence suggests that failure to eliminate dormant leukemia-initiating cells (L-IC) underlies relapse.
Efforts to prospectively isolate L-IC from ALL patients to define the critical pathways of L-IC dormancy and
chemoresistance have thus far been unsuccessful.
Research from my lab has shown that mouse double negative DN stage 3 (DN3) thymic progenitors are enriched
in L-IC that contribute to resistance to Notch targeted therapy, however the L-IC remains an undefined subset of
the leukemic DN3 population. To identify the L-IC, we profiled leukemia progression in vivo at the single cell level
and uncovered dormant and proliferative DN3 clusters that are transcriptionally distinct. In Aim 1, we will use
nucleosome labeling to track the mitotic history of dormant and proliferative DN3 leukemic cells to functionally
assess their ability to initiate leukemia and tolerate chemotherapy in vivo. We will also use scRNA-seq to profile
chemotherapy response in vivo in order to determine whether chemotherapy enriches for dormant DN3 or selects
for additional DN3 heterogeneity. We find Btg2, known to mediate T cell quiescence by deadenylating Myc,
enriched in mouse dormant DN3 leukemic cells and in ALL patient label retaining cells and ALL patients with
minimal residual disease, leading us to hypothesize that Btg2 regulates dormancy in mouse and human L-IC.
We will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by deleting Btg2 in mouse DN3 cells and examining effects on Myc
expression, dormancy and L-IC frequency. Dormancy may also reflect Polycomb repressor complex (PRC) 2
mediated silencing of the Myc enhancer as we find PRC targets enriched in dormant DN3. We will use CUT&Tag
to interrogate the Myc enhancer to uncover how Myc is suppressed in these Notch1-active dormant DN3 cells.
The work proposed in Aim 3 builds on our siRNA screen to identify glucocorticoid (GC) resistance genes
associated with relapse. We identified Estrogen Related Receptor b (ESRRb) as a novel GC resistance gene
that we find under-expressed in therapy resistant ALL patients. We demonstrate that ESRRb silencing interferes
with GC target gene expression by unclear mechanisms. We will determine if ESRRb increases glucocorticoid
receptor (GR) binding and mediates chromatin looping to potentiate GR transcription. Finally, the knowledge
gained in mouse T-ALL models will be translated to human T-ALL by determining the effect(s) of ESRRb
activation on the GC response and overall survival in GC resistant or relapsed pediatric T-ALL patient-derived
xenografts. Together, these studies will advance understanding of T-ALL pathogenesis and therapy failure by
identifying the dormant L-IC signature, revealing Btg2 and Myc as critical regulators of L-IC dormancy and by
developing novel GC re-sensitizing strategies to prevent relapse in pediatric T-ALL patients."

Obesity can pose a lifelong threat to health and quality of life for many autistic people. Across the lifespan in
autism, obesity prevalence is increased relative to non-autistic peers. One third of autistic adults have obesity
and there are concerning associations between obesity and in-hospital mortality, risk of type II diabetes, and
cardiovascular disease. Prevention in childhood should be a priority; however, ~100,000 autistic youth will
transition to adulthood each year in the United States, and there is no existing comprehensive treatment for
obesity designed specifically for autistic individuals transitioning to adulthood and greater independence. The
overall objective of this study is to identify stakeholder-generated and testable treatment components to inform
obesity intervention specifically designed for transition-age autistic youth. Comprehensive obesity treatment
programs are prime candidates for the engineering-inspired Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST)
framework that optimizes multicomponent behavioral treatment packages to expedite implementation and
maximize scalability. The proposed online study, grounded in activities for the MOST Preparation Phase, will
use a simultaneous exploratory mixed methods study design to gather perspectives on obesity treatment directly
from transition-age autistic youth with obesity. Thirty transition-age autistic youth with obesity (16-25 years) will
complete qualitative interviews to identify stakeholder-generated factors that impact obesity treatment (Aim 1).
Transition-age autistic youth with obesity (N=120), caregivers of transition-age autistic youth with obesity (N=60),
and clinical providers (N=60) will rate and prioritize the perceived effectiveness of obesity treatment components
(e.g., diet modifications, text message prompts, parent training, goal setting) that could be included in a
comprehensive obesity intervention program tailored for transition-age autistic youth (Aim 2). Then, in
partnership with a Community Advisory Board, we will integrate Aim 1 qualitative and Aim 2 quantitative findings
to iteratively develop a set of treatment components specifically tailored for transition-age autistic youth with
obesity that can be subsequently tested in a MOST framework optimization trial. The resulting Obesity Treatment
Blueprint for Transition-Age Autistic Youth will also provide initial steps toward adaptation of existing
interventions that can be leveraged for use within the proposed tailored treatment package. Aligned with NICHD
Scientific Theme 4, ‘Improving Child and Adolescent Health and the Transition to Adulthood,’ this program of
work will meet the pressing need for effective obesity treatment to improve health and quality of life for autistic
individuals across the lifespan."
10869249,"A breast cancer (BC) diagnosis is a significant life event that can adversely impact health-related quality of life
(HRQOL) in BC survivors by inducing major stress associated with diagnosis and treatment over the short-term.
Over the long-term, BC survivors can also experience major stress associated with persistent symptoms and
treatment-related late effects, as well as related psychological, social, and financial stress that persist long into
survivorship, adversely affecting HRQOL in long-term BC survivors. There is growing evidence that in addition
to these individual-level stressors, neighborhood-level stressors of the social and built environments also
adversely impact cancer survivorship outcomes, including HRQOL. Most prior studies of HRQOL, however,
examined individual-level stressors only and were focused on short-term BC survivors, primarily from non-
Hispanic White (NHW) populations. There is a significant gap in knowledge about multi-level stressors that
adversely impact HRQOL among long-term BC survivors, and it is not known whether key stressors differ among
survivors from different racial and ethnic minoritized (REM) and immigrant populations who likely have a greater
burden of both individual-level and neighborhood-level stressors. We will conduct the R21 pilot study in the
Northern California Breast Cancer Family Registry (NC-BCFR), a prospective population-based cohort enriched
with African American, Asian American, and Hispanic women with incident BC diagnosed from 1995-2009 who
have been actively followed for 14-28 years since diagnosis. From the 1,116 active long-term BC survivors who
completed the latest follow-up (2019-2022), we will select a representative sample of BC survivors who self-
identified as African American, Asian American, or Hispanic. We will collect questionnaire data online or by
phone interview on HRQOL, individual-level stressors (cancer-specific and social stressors), and updated
sociodemographic characteristics for 270 participants (90 African American, 90 Asian American, 90 Hispanic
survivors). Using geospatial data from the American Community Survey, we will append census-tract level
neighborhood characteristics and derive social neighborhood-level stressors to geocoded addresses. We will
collect blood samples for 176 participants and measure C-reactive protein (CRP) and a panel of cytokines to
explore associations with multi-level stressors and with HRQOL. In Aim 1, we will explore associations between
multi-level stressors and HRQOL and identify key stressors in each racial, ethnic, and nativity group. In Aim 2,
we will assess variation in inflammatory biomarkers by multi-level stressors and by HRQOL. The findings from
this R21 pilot study will inform the design of a larger study of stress, inflammation, and HRQOL among long-term
BC survivors. The identification of specific long-term BC survivor groups with low HRQOL and specific stressor
profiles will inform survivorship care and lay the foundation for future targeted multi-level strategies and
interventions to reduce multi-level stressors and improve HRQOL in all racial, ethnic, and nativity groups of BC
survivors, with the ultimate goal of achieving high HRQOL, improved survival, and health equity for all survivors."

Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) remains one of the leading causes of neonatal
morbidity and mortality, affecting 1-8 per 1000 live births in the developed world and even more
in the developing world. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a reduction in death or
disability in newborns with moderate or severe HIE treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH).
The gold standard for assessment of brain injury after HI is brain magnetic resonance imaging
with spectroscopy (MRI-MRS). However, this study is not obtained until the 72-hour TH
treatment is complete. Therefore, there is a need for informative and real-time bedside tools and
biomarkers to continuously monitor cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism and guide
intervention, to prevent further brain injury, provide prognostic information to families, and
potentially improve neurodevelopmental outcome. Building on our extensive history of success
monitoring infants with non-invasive bedside optical methods, we propose to design and build a
novel, 8-wavelength, low-cost, wearable, wireless oxCCO near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
device. This device will quantify the oxidation state of cytochrome c (oxCCO) providing a
measurement of cerebral metabolism, in addition to hemoglobin concentration (Hb) and
hemoglobin oxygenation (SO2). Prior work by other groups has demonstrated a relationship
between oxCCO and brain injury severity. We will extend this work by continuous monitoring
throughout TH, rewarming, and after rewarming. This oxCCO-NIRS technology is an extension
of our LED-based wearable device, called FlexNIRS, which has been used and tested by the
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) team in phantoms and humans to verify performance
and demonstrate accuracy in measurements. The device will be tested initially in term neonates
with transient respiratory distress in the MGH NICU to demonstrate changes in oxCCO during
periods of mild oxygen desaturation. Finally, the device will be used to continuously monitor 20
neonates being treated with 72 hours of TH, during rewarming, and 1-2 days after rewarming to
test our hypothesis that an increased frequency of dynamic changes in cerebral metabolism
during each epoch of time will correlate with brain injury presence and severity. Our goal is to
provide a non-invasive bedside monitor of cerebral metabolism to guide early prognostication
and to provide an opportunity for individualized intervention in real-time to reduce brain injury
and improve neurodevelopmental outcome. This “proof of principle” pilot study will set the stage
for a larger trial using this device in the future."
10870429,"Title: Racial and Ethnic Differences in Emergency Medical Services Interventions for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac
Arrest
Abstract: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) represents a significant public health concern, affecting an
estimated 347,000 individuals in the United States annually. Despite various efforts, the mortality rate after
OHCA remains distressingly high, with a mere 9.0% of patients surviving to hospital discharge. Prior research
has highlighted racial and ethnic disparities in patient outcomes following OHCA; notably, Black and Hispanic
patients display lower rates of survival to hospital discharge compared to White patients. However, the
underlying reasons for the disparities have yet to be fully explored. In particular, the influence of racial and
ethnic differences on resuscitation practices employed by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel
remains unclear despite the integral role of EMS in OHCA management.
To address these crucial knowledge gaps, we aim to scrutinize racial and ethnic differences (Black or Hispanic
as compared with White) in prehospital resuscitation interventions for OHCA, using the Resuscitation
Outcomes Consortium (ROC) Epidemiologic Registry, a comprehensive prospective OHCA registry at 10 sites
in North America. In this proposal, we will focus our investigation on racial and ethnic differences in three key
EMS interventions: time to defibrillations, time to epinephrine administration, and time to termination of
resuscitation (TOR). These practices are not only associated with patient outcomes after cardiac arrest but
also modifiable through educational and clinical interventions. Additionally, it remains unclear whether racial
and ethnic differences in EMS interventions diverge based on patients’ sex (intersectionality). We will evaluate
the intersectionality, assessing whether sex is an effect modifier on racial and ethnic differences in time to the
EMS interventions. Lastly, we will quantify the contribution of racial and ethnic differences in EMS interventions
to racial and ethnic disparities in survival using mediation analyses.
Our overall objective is to augment our comprehension of these potential disparities in prehospital practices
and identify modifiable areas for enhancing OHCA care. We will leverage OHCA as a representative case for
time-sensitive conditions, with the objective of evaluating racial and ethnic disparities in EMS practices as
potential contributors to the prevailing health inequity. Our team is comprised of experts in cardiac arrest
research, health disparities research, causal inference, and statistical modelling with extensive experience with
the ROC dataset, ensuring the feasibility of the proposed project.
We anticipate that our study will identify specific areas where interventions can be implemented to mitigate
racial and ethnic disparities in patient outcomes after OHCA and serve as a pioneering step toward the further
evaluation of health inequity in relation to other time-sensitive conditions within EMS systems."
10865446,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Aging is an incredibly plastic process that is dictated by coordinated repair and regenerative
mechanisms. Loss of this coordination marks the start of tissue decline and aging, thereby increasing disease
susceptibility. Alarmingly, age-dependent diseases are disproportionately rising in young age groups without
known cause. Early-Age Onset Colorectal Cancer (EAO CRC) is a prime example, which African Americans
experience the highest disease burden.
Rationale: Previously, we discovered a novel Hedgehog (Hh)-dependent mechanism that balances cellular
repair and regeneration to sustain healthy tissue aging. Specifically, we identified the Hh effector Patched (Ptc)
as a critical switch for balancing autophagy-based cellular repair and Hh-dependent regenerative proliferation.
Importantly, loss of Ptc function drives accelerated cellular aging. Hypothesis: We propose that the cells are
aging rapidly relative to chronological age, due to the loss of this Hh-dependent coordination of autophagy and
proliferation. We predict factors that promote aberrant Hh signaling predispose individuals to EAO CRC onset.
Specific Aims: To test this hypothesis, I will delineate the mechanism of Hh signaling in balancing autophagy
and proliferation to preserve cellular aging (Aim 1); define the Hh-dependent transcriptome during aging, with a
particular interest in identifying genes that are dysregulated in cancers impacting African Americans (Aim 2);
and functionally test the intersection of Hh signaling and genetic determinants of cancer disparities using both
the Drosophila intestines model and patient-derived colon organoids (Aim 3). This study will precisely define
fundamental mechanisms and aging-dependent cellular markers that are applicable to diseases impacting
African American communities. The culmination of this investigation will hone the required knowledge, technical
skillsets, and professional networks to successfully launch my independent research program, focused on
elucidating regulators of the autophagy-proliferation balance to reduce aging-related disease disparities."

Regeneration is widespread and variable in the animal kingdom. Regenerative capacity of the human central
nervous system (CNS) following injury or disease is poor, yet several mechanisms exist in several vertebrate
organisms that lead to functional regeneration of the CNS. What is different between what happens at injury
sites in these organisms and in humans? Are lost neuron types and neuronal wiring patterns restored upon
regeneration of neural circuitry in animals that can achieve this feat? I propose to develop a novel experimental
vertebrate regeneration system that will enable identification of mechanisms that naturally promote nervous
system regeneration. Specifically, I plan to focus on Danionella cerebrum, a miniature and transparent fish
species that has the smallest vertebrate brain on record, with ~650,000 neurons in total. Because of its minute
size, optical transparency, complex behavioral repertoire, and genetic tractability Danionella cerebrum is
potentially unparalleled as a vertebrate for tissue-wide single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and for whole-
body and -brain imaging applications targeted to evaluate cellular dynamics in the adult state. I have two main
aims: In aim 1, I plan to generate a complete Danionella cerebrum scRNA-seq atlas that includes
homeostatic and regenerating states. Generation of a single-cell transcriptome atlas of the whole body of a
vertebrate will be a powerful resource for a myriad of central problems in vertebrate biology and neuroscience.
The proposed resource combined with the small size of the Danionella nervous system will enable utilization of
scRNA-seq experiments in the future to probe a host of problems that involve body-wide manipulation of neural
development and circuit activity, and recovery following injury. This dataset will also allow characterization and
manipulation of circuit components within distinct areas of the central and peripheral nervous system, and will
identify genes with appropriate cell-specific expression to enable genetic cell ablations, cell-specific labeling, and
imaging of regenerating neural circuits. Because of its optical transparency, I have complete access to the
Danionella nervous system for validation and future functional imaging studies. In aims 2 and 3, I propose to
develop strategies to study and manipulate neural dynamics during regeneration, and in the absence of
it (i.e. following inhibition of regeneration). This aim will include generation of cell type-specific nitroreductase
expression-based genetic cell ablation lines, surgical injury strategies, learning and memory paradigms, and a
calcium imaging platform to enable characterization of functional regeneration in the nervous system. Success
with this aim will enable future work elucidating the “rules” for functional integration of new neurons following
acute and chronic ablation in the nervous system. The molecular and cellular insights gained from the proposed
aims will accelerate discovery and understanding of fundamental aspects of neural regeneration with potential
for developing approaches that could be taken to generate therapeutic intervention in the cases of nervous
system injury and degeneration."
10868134,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT:
Hyperactive, postzygotic mutations in the GNAQ gene (encoding for Gaq proteins) have been identified in
vascular anomalies. Patients affected by this class of vascular anomalies experience extensive disfigurement
and can develop a life-threatening coagulopathy termed Kasabach-Merritt Phenomenon (KMP). Despite these
genetic findings, animal models for GNAQ-related vascular anomalies and KMP do not exist. This has severely
hindered the preclinical development of effective targeted therapies for these patients.
In our preliminary experiments we generated a transgenic murine model of mutant hyperactive GNAQ-driven
vascular anomaly which recapitulates common histopathological findings in patients and a coagulopathy
reminiscent of KMP, a potentially lethal disease complication. Furthermore, our studies showed that in patient-
derived lesional tissue with GNAQ Q209L mutation, the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway is hyperactive as well as
increased EC proliferation. We have exciting data that the MEK/ERK inhibitor Trametinib extended the life span
of GNAQ mutant mice suggesting this may be a promising therapy for patients.
To date there are no studies examining the role of mutant active GNAQ (p.Q209L) in vascular development and
disease. This proposal will culminate with the development of innovative in vivo, in vitro, and Vessel-on-Chip
models that we will use for the identification of cellular and molecular mechanisms implicated in vascular disease.
Furthermore, with our powerful murine model we are uniquely positioned to develop a comprehensive research
program to investigate the GNAQ role in vascular lesion formation and expansion with the goal of identifying
highly needed therapeutic targets for vascular anomalies and related complications such as coagulopathies.
Additionally, our studies will provide cellular and mechanistic insights to advance our understanding of
pathological and physiological vessel formation and size maintenance."

The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal survey of a nationally representative sample of
U.S. families that began in 1968. Together with the PSID Child Development Supplement (CDS) and the PSID
Transition into Adulthood Supplement (TAS), the overall PSID data archive has been instrumental in advancing
social, behavioral, and economic research within a life course and intergenerational perspective. A growing
body of evidence suggests that genetic factors play a key role in health, behavioral, and socioeconomic out-
comes in childhood, over the life course, and across generations. However, such information is currently ab-
sent from the PSID data archive. In the 2014 wave of CDS (CDS-14), 2,513 saliva samples from children and
their primary caregivers (typically a parent) were collected and subsequently sequenced to obtain genome-
wide genetic data. These genomic data provide unprecedented new opportunities to study a variety of social-
genetic effects on childhood and life course outcomes that capitalize on the existing strengths of PSID. How-
ever, with an extremely large dataset that contains >37 million variables and occupies more than 3 TB disk
space, genomic data pose insurmountable challenges to all but the most sophisticated analysts. We will ad-
dress these challenges by undertaking important enhancements that will help researchers to use genomic data
efficiently and effectively with minimal start-up time. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) develop im-
portant secondary data that are essential for genetic analyses, including a genetic relatedness matrix, popula-
tion-level and ancestry-specific genetic principal components, and imputed genotypes for the unmeasured non-
primary caregiver parent of each child; 2) produce additional genomic data products, including polygenic
scores and candidate SNP files for a variety of social/behavioral traits and health outcomes; 3) prepare com-
prehensive documentation of the CDS-14 genomic data and derived measures and publicize their availability to
current and prospective data users. The enhancements will allow researchers to efficiently and effectively in-
corporate genomic data when addressing crucial scientific questions about how genetic propensity and the so-
cial environment intervene to shape health, behavior, and well-being in childhood, over the life course, and
across generations. This project will also lead to the first formal dissemination of PSID genomic data and pro-
vide an important foundation for future work as we continue to expand and enhance genomic data in PSID and
CDS."

10880688,"SUMMARY
In pregnancy, women typically gain 16-40 pounds and undergo numerous physiological changes with potentially
long-lasting consequences. Yet, research on pregnancy as a window of susceptibility to environmental
exposures has focused primarily on the child and largely overlooked women’s long-term weight gain and
cardiometabolic health. Emerging risk factors for obesity include air pollution that acts via respirable fine particles
<2.5 μm (PM2.5) and psychosocial stress. Our preliminary data identify pregnancy as a unique window of
vulnerability to PM2.5 and stress for women, indicating that effects of air pollution and stress during pregnancy
may be critical for women’s health over their lifecourse. Pregnancy requires the development of a new organ—
the placenta—which has long been recognized as a mediator of fetal programming. Increasing evidence
implicates micro (mi)RNAs as regulators of this process, but their role in long-term maternal programming has
not been considered. Supported by previous work and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that exposures
during pregnancy disrupt miRNA signals released by placental trophoblasts within nano-sized extracellular
vesicles (EVs) into the maternal circulation, programming maternal tissues toward obesity and cardiometabolic
conditions. To our knowledge, the joint effects of air pollution and stress on mothers during pregnancy have not
been studied, nor have EV-miRNAs been investigated as potential long-term, pregnancy-specific mechanisms
regulating maternal outcomes. We will address these gaps in the PROGRESS study, a high-risk population in
Mexico City with high but variable PM2.5 exposure and high psychosocial stress exposure. By studying
PROGRESS mothers recruited in pregnancy, we can cost-effectively conduct a longitudinal study from the 2nd
trimester through 10 years after pregnancy. We will also conduct state-of-the-art plasma metabolomic profiling
to enhance capacity of identifying early metabolic changes. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of higher
PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy on weight retention 1 year post-partum, as well as on adiposity (weight, BMI,
waist/hip circumferences, body fat %), cardiometabolic biomarkers (blood glucose, insulin resistance, lipids,
adipokines) and ultrasound-based measures of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis longitudinally over 10 years.
In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of higher levels of stress from life experiences (violence, depression,
negative life events) and stress biomarkers (diurnal salivary cortisol rhythms) during pregnancy on those same
adiposity and cardiometabolic endpoints—independently and/or jointly with higher PM2.5 exposure during
pregnancy. In Aim 3, we will investigate the impact of PM2.5 and stress on placenta-specific EV-miRNA during
pregnancy and on the women’s metabolome 1 month and 4 years after delivery. In Aim 4, we will apply statistical
causal modeling to characterize the patterns linking EV-miRNA and metabolomics with PM2.5, stress, cortisol
rhythms, and maternal adiposity and cardiometabolic health. If successful, our work will impel interventions that
may help millions of women to prevent lifelong changes in body weight and adverse cardiometabolic outcomes."
10880691,"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of chromosome 6 and the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor
(KIR) region of chromosome 19 are among the most variable and medically important regions of the human
genome. The MHC encodes the highly polymorphic human leukocyte antigens (HLA) that are central to immunity
and reproduction, and another 140 genes, many with supporting roles in immunity. A subset of HLA allotypes
interact with KIR, which are expressed by Natural Killer (NK) cells, modulating their activities in initiating and
controlling the immune response. Specific alleles as well as compound genotypes of MHC and KIR have been
implicated in susceptibility or resistance to infectious, allergic, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases, as well
as to outcomes of hematopoietic cell transplantation and reproductive success.
Asthma is one of the most common inflammatory diseases affecting over 30 million Americans, with 5,000 deaths
per year. Atopic dermatitis (AD) occurs in 20% of children and predisposes to asthma. Together they pose
significant burden on the health and economy of the country, costing an estimated $82 billion per year. Common
to these diseases are a strong genetic component, an environmental or infection trigger, and complex interplay
between innate and adaptive immunity. Accordingly, there are long standing associations with MHC diversity
and asthma susceptibility, which have been confirmed by recent large scale genome studies, but they remain
poorly refined due to the complexity and difficulty of sequencing the region. For the same reasons, the KIR region
has never been studied to high resolution in AD or asthma.
To overcome difficulties in analyzing these complex genomic regions, we developed a targeted sequencing and
bioinformatics approach to analyze MHC and KIR regions at high throughput and resolution. In Aim 1 we will use
the methods to analyze the complete MHC genomic regions from 5,000 patients and 5,000 controls, investigating
each gene as well as their pathways of interaction. We will study well defined cohorts of individuals from diverse
backgrounds, focusing on African ancestry, which associates with the highest prevalence and poorest outcome.
We will sequence the entire MHC with high accuracy to determine the full context of any variants associated with
asthma susceptibility. In Aim 2 we will perform the first high resolution analysis of NK cell diversity in asthma,
supported by directed functional analyses of the activity and specificity of NK cells in disease. By combining high-
resolution analysis of KIR and HLA genes with known functional properties of these interactions, we will be able
to determine the role of NK cell diversity in asthma. To enhance our methodology and solve the most difficult
genomic structural variation, in Aim 3 we will design and implement the first methods to target long-read
sequencing specifically to the MHC and KIR regions, and a bioinformatics pipeline to annotate and analyze the
data. In doing so we will expand the MHC reference set and tools for large-scale analysis. Through these three
Aims we will accelerate understanding of the natural immunity of atopic asthma and begin to identify novel targets
for intervention"
10880694,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in the US and is the primary cause of chronic heart failure.
For patients with coronary artery disease, some advancements have been made clinically to restore blood flow
in diseased arteries and reduce myocardial injury from the resulting ischemia and subsequent reperfusion.
However, even with these advancements one quarter of patients will die or develop heart failure within 1 year.
Damage to the myocardium during ischemic injury includes deficiencies in metabolism and energetics. Some
key epigenetic regulators can prevent or reduce ischemic injury and pathological remodeling in murine models,
however, their ubiquitous expression has made them unsuitable for therapeutic targeting in humans, thus far. In
contrast, we recently identified the only known myocyte-specific epigenetic regulator of mitochondrial energetics
and metabolism – the histone lysine methyltransferase Smyd1 – which holds great therapeutic potential given
its tissue-specific expression. Specifically, we performed the first analysis of Smyd1 function in the adult
myocardium using inducible, cardiomyocyte-specific Smyd1 knockout mice and showed that loss of Smyd1 leads
to dysregulated cardiac metabolism and suppressed mitochondrial respiration, ultimately leading to heart failure
(published in AJP). Subsequently we showed that down-regulation of mitochondrial energetics is an early event
in these knockout mice (occurring before the onset of cardiac dysfunction) and results, at least in part, from
Smyd1’s regulation of PGC-1α transcription (published in PNAS). To further understand Smyd1’s role in
regulating cardiac physiology we recently generated transgenic mice allowing inducible, cardiomyocyte-specific
overexpression of the Smyd1a isoform (the mouse ortholog to human SMYD1) and subjected these mice to
permanent occlusion of the LAD. Our unpublished preliminary results show that Smyd1a gain-of-function can
enhance mitochondrial respiration and protect from ischemic injury, although how this is accomplished
molecularly is unknown. In addition, our preliminary data from these mice show increased mitochondrial cristae
formation and stabilization of respiratory chain supercomplexes within the cristae, concomitant with increased
Opa1 expression, a known driver of cristae morphology. These results implicate Opa1 as a novel, functionally
important downstream target of Smyd1a whereby cardiomyocytes upregulate energy efficiency, protecting them
from ischemic injury. Our overarching hypothesis is that Smyd1a protects from ischemic injury by regulating
mitochondrial energetics and enhancing respiration efficiency in the cardiomyocyte through regulation of both:
1) PGC-1α expression (a regulator of electron transport chain gene expression) and 2) OPA1-mediated cristae
remodeling and stabilization of electron transport chain supercomplexes. We will test this hypothesis in our
transgenic mice which conditionally overexpress Smyd1a. In addition, we will examine these pathways in cells
and human tissue with a putative SMYD1 loss-of-function variant, N101S, which we identified with collaborators
at the U. of Pittsburgh (Dr Lina Gonzalez) in a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure."
10878226,"Project Summary/Abstract
Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by acute, intermittent and recurrent episodes of
inflammation that can be induced by a specific allergen. CD4+ T cells contribute to this process by producing the
Type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and inducing B cell production of IgE in response to T cell receptor (TCR)
recognition of allergen peptides bound to MHCII molecules on host cells. In both murine models of disease and
asthmatic patients, quiescent allergen peptide:MHCII (pMHCII)-specific CD4+ memory T cells can persist in
lungs and lymphoid organs long after resolution of inflammation. Upon subsequent exposure to allergen, CD4+
memory T cells rapidly drive asthma-induced immunopathology making these cells attractive targets for allergen-
specific immune modulation. Little is known, however, about the function and maintenance of Th2 memory cells
that orchestrate the asthmatic response due to the challenge of tracking small populations of CD4+ T cells that
express allergen pMHCII: specific TCRs. To address this lack of knowledge, we produced an MHCII tetramer
containing a peptide from the Der p1 protein of the house dust mite (HDM), Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus,
the most common cause of atopic asthma. Using this tetramer and a novel magnetic bead-based cell enrichment
method of our design, we have found that IL-2 dependent, functionally heterogeneous populations of Th2 tissue
resident memory cells reside in the lung for long periods of time. The central hypothesis of this application is that
these distinct yet synergistic populations of Th2 “effector Trm” and B cell helping “Tfh Trm” contribute to asthma
pathogenesis in unique ways. The goals of this proposal are to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms
that lead to Th2 Trm cell heterogeneity and determine how these cells persist in different regions of the lung.
This innovative approach could provide the means for targeting specific pathologic functions of memory Th2
cells by immunotherapy or eliminating them altogether."

One of the hallmarks of HIV infection is chronic immune activation/inflammation, which is strongly associated
with and predictive of HIV disease progression, even in patients that were successfully treated with anti-retroviral
therapy (ART). We and other have shown that chronic elevation of type I IFN signaling in HIV+ individuals is a
major driver in immune activation. Alleviating chronic activation may reduce disease progression and prevent or
slow down progression of HIV-associated diseases, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND),
which is fueled by inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). In recent years, studies have suggested
that major components of cannabis, namely THC and CBD, may have anti-inflammatory properties. However,
the individual and combined effects and mechanisms of THC and CBD on immune activation during HIV infection
remain elusive. In this project, we aim to study the individual and combined effects of THC and CBD on immune
cell activation and CNS inflammation during HIV infection. We hypothesize that THC and CBD regulate IFN-I
mediated inflammation differently by binding to and signaling through diverse cannabinoid receptors. We will
carefully evaluate if treatment of THC and CBD have the potential to reduce chronic inflammation and improve
immune function against HIV infection."
10886865,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Myeloid malignancy is characterized by the acquisition of mutations in a stereotyped order with distinct patterns
of cooperating mutations. Mutations in genes that alter polycomb repressive complex (PRC) function, such as
BCOR, are strongly associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) arising from myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS). BCOR inactivating mutations disrupt non-canonical PRC1.1 complex assembly and cause the de-
repression of target genes involved in leukemogenesis. We found that among patients with U2AF1 mutations,
BCOR mutations were enriched exclusively in those with the S34F mutation. This proposal seeks to leverage
this unique U2AF1 codon-specific co-mutation to define the mechanisms by which BCOR/PRC1.1 inactivation
promotes splicing factor mutant MDS progression. I have assembled a cohort of 4,193 patients with myeloid
malignancies and generated isogenic K562 cell lines and genetically engineered mice to model U2AF1S34F and
BCOR co-mutation. My preliminary data indicate that U2AF1 mutation context affects the transcriptional output
of BCOR/PRC1.1 inactivation and the combination of U2af1S34F and Bcor deletion in mice causes the most
severe hematologic abnormalities. My central hypothesis is that U2AF1S34F enforces the conditional selection of
subclonal BCOR/PRC1.1 inactivation by modulating PRC1.1 target gene expression to promote clonal
expansion and worsening ineffective hematopoiesis, hallmarks of MDS progression. Aim 1 will define the clinical
and genetic pathways of BCOR/PRC1.1-mediated MDS progression. Aim 2 will determine the differential effect
of U2AF1S34F versus U2AF1Q157P mutations on BCOR/PRC1.1 localization, function, and target gene expression.
Aim 3 will determine the impact of Bcor/PRC1.1 inactivation on U2af1S34F mutant hematopoiesis in vivo. The
long-term goals of the proposed research are to gain fundamental insights into how PRC1.1 and splicing factor
dysfunction interact to promote MDS progression and inform therapeutic strategies for patients.
The applicant, Dr. Rahul Vedula, is an oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). He spends 80% of his
time engaged in translational research and 20% of his time in clinical practice caring for patients with hematologic
malignancies. Dr. Vedula has outlined a five-year career development plan that will enable him to meet his goal
of becoming an independent translational investigator focused on myeloid disease progression. Dr. Vedula will
perform the proposed research under the mentorship of Dr. Coleman Lindsley, an expert in myeloid biology and
clonal hematopoiesis. Dr. Vedula has assembled a scientific advisory committee of internationally recognized
experts to provide scientific and career mentorship. He will obtain additional training in the use of mouse models
for hematologic malignancy research, computational biology, and biostatistics through collaborations and
coursework. Dr. Vedula will conduct the proposed research at DFCI, a rich research environment with a long
track-record of training successful physician-scientists."
10886971,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The airway epithelium serves as a barrier between the aerosol environment and the underlying
submucosa. Inhaled air often carries noxious agents and pathogens that can injure the lung. Severe lung injury
can lead to persistent inflammation, dysplastic repair, and permanent loss of gas exchange surface area. Injury
from common respiratory viral infection, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2, can lead to chronic lung disease
or exacerbation of lung conditions. Airway cells contribute to regeneration following lung injury, although the
heterogeneity of airway cell identity following lung repair is incompletely understood.
 My research centers on rare airway cell types and their function in the post-viral lung. We have
previously studied the differentiation of an unexpected airway cell type, tuft cells, during repair. Using single
nucleus expression and accessible chromatin sequencing to survey airway cells following influenza injury, we
identify a rare airway cell present in the post-viral lung, Microfold (M) cells. M cells have not been studied in the
lung but in other contexts associate with lymphoid follicles, where they function to capture and deliver luminal
antigens and secrete chemokines. The proposed research will identify pulmonary M cell progenitors and
determine mechanisms required for M cell differentiation. This proposal uncovers M cells as part of a follicle
associated epithelium (FAE) overlying induced bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT), implying M cells
function to promote mucosal immune responses. The proposed aims will define the role of M cells in lung
immune surveillance. My future research program will test the role of M cells in secondary bacterial infection,
as much of the morbidity of pulmonary influenza infections can be attributed to secondary bacterial infection.
Examining interactions between M cells and the immune compartment will contribute to our understanding of
immune regulation during post-viral chronic inflammation.
 A second outcome from my focus on airway repair following severe influenza infection is an effort to
promote the resolution of basal-like scar tissue into normal alveolar epithelium. Bronchiolization of the distal
airway is a hallmark of multiple human lung diseases, and providing regenerative therapies will require detailed
understanding of the regulation of basal-like cells. I propose defining a genetic mouse model that promotes
differentiation of alveolar basal-like cells into alveolar epithelial cell fates.
 My primary mentor is Dr. Xin Sun, a leader in the field of lung biology who has made fundamental
discoveries in lung development and disease. I will receive guidance from my mentorship committee, a group
with expertise in lung biology and physiology, immunology and epigenetics. The proposed experiments and
training plan will further my skills in bioinformatics and immunology. This research will be conducted at
University of California San Diego, a leading research institution with necessary resources and a collaborative
scientific community."

Cardiac arrest remains one of the leading causes of death and disability in the U.S.A. This proposal is a
competitive renewal application. In the previous funding cycle, we defined the pathophysiological mechanisms
impairing functional recovery following asphyxia cardiac arrest (ACA). Because CA promotes significant
cognitive deficits, our central emphasis in the previous cycle was to understand the mechanisms behind ACA
induced synaptic deficits and to establish novel, mitigating therapies against these deficits. Furthermore, new
evidence in heart failure (HF) patients indicate that brain alterations in these patients are similar to regions
affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting that HF may be a major risk factor for AD. We discovered, in
our previous studies, that physical exercise (PE) following ACA significantly enhances cognitive recovery. To
require ailing, elderly CA patients, however, to adhere to a chronic exercise regimen presents a major obstacle.
Therefore, we focus this competitive renewal on defining the mechanisms by which PE ameliorates cognitive
deficits following ACA, and specifically defining potential post-ACA neurotherapeutics to act synergistically, with
mild, beneficial PE. These goals will be achieved in the following specific aims: 1) To determine the effect of
post-ACA PE on synaptic function, cognitive outcomes, and AD-like pathology of young female and male rats;
2) To identify molecular factors mediating the ameliorating effects of PE on cognitive deficits following ACA; and
3) To determine whether the combination of PE with pharmacological agents mitigates cognitive deficits and
improves functional recovery after ACA in aged animals of both sexes."

Dr. Rosedahl’s long-term career goal is to understand how vision operates in tasks that involve the interaction
between multiple visual processes such as category learning, visual perceptual learning, and visual attention.
This knowledge could be used to design better training paradigms for visual tasks and increase the efficiency
of visual rehabilitation training. In this project, Dr. Rosedahl will examine how category learning and attention
induce visual perceptual learning transfer. Visual Perceptual Learning (VPL) is long-term improvement in visual
tasks like telling the difference between the angle of two lines or detecting the presence of stripes. VPL is one
of the most promising methods to improve vision in individuals with visual impairment. Unfortunately, research
has found that VPL is very specific to the trained task. This specificity greatly limits the use of VPL in training
paradigms for visual rehabilitation and motivates the goal of this work: to understand the mechanisms by which
VPL can transfer to untrained features and visual field locations. This work focuses on understanding two
paradigms that cause VPL to transfer: Category-Learning Induced Transfer of VPL (CIT-VPL) and double-
training. To understand the neural mechanism behind transfer in these paradigms and prepare for his
independent career, Dr. Rosedahl will receive training in technical and career skills at Brown University. He will
be mentored in visual perceptual learning by Prof. Takeo Watanabe, deep neural network models of vision by
Prof. Thomas Serre, and brain imaging techniques by Prof. Yuka Sasaki. Dr. Rosedahl will then build a unified
model of category learning, visual processing, VPL, and feature-based attention (Aim 1). Dr. Rosedahl will use
this model (CAPL) to interpret the results of four experiments to determine if feature-based attention is causing
transfer in CIT-VPL (Aim 2). The experiments will measure performance improvement, neural activation using
functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and changes in neurotransmitter concentrations using Magnetic
Resonance Spectroscopy. Dr. Rosedahl will also receive training in essential skills to facilitate the transition to
his independent research career, such as grant writing, manuscript preparation, oral communication, lab
management, and preparing job application materials. After securing his independent position as an assistant
professor, Dr. Rosedahl will expand CAPL to include spatial attention (Aim 3) and use the improved model to
interpret experiments testing whether feature-based attention and spatial attention combine to cause transfer in
double-training (Aim 4). Overall, the work proposed here will establish a novel unified model of category
learning, attention, and VPL (CAPL) and provide insight into the mechanisms of VPL transfer, knowledge that
is currently lacking. CAPL will be a valuable resource for the broader scientific community to study visual
learning. Additionally, the knowledge gained here could yield novel insights into optimizing VPL training
paradigms, providing critical information for developing effective visual rehabilitation methods."

This is a competing renewal of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) Oncology K12. The UNC
K12 continues to meet an unmet need at UNC by providing a cancer-specific training and mentoring program
for junior faculty in multiple departments and divisions within the UNC School of Medicine. These departments
and divisions include: Divisions of Adult Oncology, Hematology, and Surgical Oncology, Division of Pediatric
Hematology/Oncology, as well as the Departments of Radiation Oncology, Pathology and Lab Medicine, and
Urology. The UNC K12 is the only cancer-specific junior faculty training program at the University. The
primary goal of the UNC K12 is to develop a successful, rigorously trained cadre of researchers focused on
patient-oriented research in three main focus areas including translational research, clinical trials research, and
health services research. The UNC K12 offers several unique aspects of training and mentoring including
vertical integration with other translational training grants (allowing for mentoring opportunities), communication
and skills development (both scientific and lay), and didactic and experiential training on translational or
patient-oriented research. The program will continue to be led by Dr. William Kim, Professor of Medicine,
Genetics, and Pharmacology. He will be assisted by Associate Director (AD), Dr. Lisa Carey and Assistant
Director (aD), Dr. Katie Reeder-Hayes who bring expertise in clinical trials and outcomes research respectively.
The Internal Advisory Board (IAB) and External Advisory Board (EAB) members have been invaluable in
guiding the UNC K12 over the past funding period and will continue to provide significant additional experience
and expertise in the development, administration, and evaluation of junior faculty training programs. The UNC
K12 will admit 2 junior faculty scholars per cohort year, for a total of 4 scholars at a time. Each scholar will
receive 2 years of support. During the last funding period we were able to fund 12 scholars (16% of which were
URI in medicine) whose records and accomplishments are detailed in the progress report but include the
promotion of scholars to Associate Professor, high impact publications, as well as several NCI K08 awards and
other significant funding. Major changes from our last renewal include the recruitment of Dr. Carey and Dr.
Reeder-Hayes as AD and aD respectively, the addition of Dr. Sandra Wong to the EAB to give guidance on
unique challenges faced by surgeon-scientists as well as health services research, and finally, the pairing of a
patient advocate with each scholar (PAP Program) to enhance the scholar's ability to communicate with non-
scientific audiences as well as to give input into research projects. The UNC K12 has a track record of
success, serves an unmet need for cancer-specific training, and will continue to serve as a nexus for the
development of patient-oriented junior faculty researchers at UNC."
10878261,"Project Summary:
There have been four influenza outbreaks that caused global pandemics causing major threats to public health.
Although influenza vaccines have been available for protection, current vaccines are strain-specific and require
annual renewal, whereas the development of antiviral drugs encountered the problem of drug resistance. In
addition to improving the prevention and treatment of flu, developing a rapid and precise method for detecting
specific influenza variants could assist prophylactic measures, and glycan arrays have been an effective tool to
meet this purpose. During influenza infection, the virus surface hemagglutinin first interacts with a sialoside
receptor on the respiratory tract followed by neuraminidase-mediated cleavage of sialic acid from the receptor
for viral entry. Determining the precise structure of the sialoside receptor and the detailed mechanism of infection
will facilitate the development of better diagnostic methods. Unfortunately, current N-glycan samples occupy only
a small percentage of the glycans required for the study of the influenza virus. The availability of asymmetrically
branched N-glycans is instrumental to the development of next-generation diagnostic tools and glycan
sequencing methods. The improved chemoenzymatic and modular strategies developed in this study will enable
the previously infeasible synthesis of complex glycans commonly found in the respiratory tract but absent in the
current arrays. These complex glycans will be used to create a comprehensive glycan array, thus advancing our
understanding of the precise binding specificity of HA subtypes and the rapid detection of influenza variants.
Monoclonal antibodies have been used for the treatment of life-threatening diseases, including viral infections.
While the Fab region defines antibody specificity against viral targets, the Fc region recruits immune cells to fight
infection. In particular, the function of a single N-glycan at N297 of Fc is to engage FcγRIIIA and FcγRIIA
receptors, activating the antibody-depended cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and the long-lasting vaccinal
effect respectively for neutralization and clearance of infected cells. We have identified the α2,6-sialylated
complex type biantennary glycan without core fucose (SCT) as an optimal modification for the broadly
neutralizing anti-influenza antibody FI6 to exhibit the best ADCC and vaccinal effect. In this study, we will
evaluate the 7F-SCT glycoform of FI6, which is stable toward sialidase degradation and is expected to have
optimal effector functions yet can be synthesized enzymatically.
We anticipate that the strategies and methods developed in this study will further transform the field of influenza
research and glycoscience enabling access to multi-antennary N-glycans and precise arrays for the study of HA
binding specificity and evaluation of homogenous antibodies against influenza infection."
10878572,"One in 10 Americans is living with diabetes, a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas is no longer able to make insulin, or when the body cannot make good use of the insulin it produces. Diabetes impacts an individual’s quality of life, decreases their life expectancy, and increases their risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and dementia. These consequences of diabetes highlight the importance of identifying effective strategies for prevention of diabetes, and treatment and management of diabetes after diagnosis. In studies that aim to formally test such interventions, it is often the case that long term follow-up of patients is needed in order to observe the primary outcome. The identification and use of surrogate markers in such intervention studies have the potential to support more timely decision-making about the intervention’s effectiveness. While incredible progress has been made in the development of statistical methods to identify surrogate markers, existing methods for evaluating surrogate markers and appropriately using surrogate markers to test for a treatment effect in a future study still face key challenges. Importantly, there are no robust methods to identify when a surrogate may be useful for only certain subgroups of patients, where such subgroups are defined by multiple patient characteristics. Existing methods are limited to a single patient characteristic, but in practice, heterogeneity of a surrogate is more complex and is likely a function of multiple covariates. For example, the surrogacy of changes in hormone levels likely varies by not just sex but also age and body mass index. The impact of such complex heterogeneity is especially important to understand with respect to its potential to lead to violations of surrogacy assumptions that existing methods commonly require to ensure that future testing on the surrogate would accurately reflect testing on the primary outcome. When such testing is not in alignment, termed a surrogate paradox, incorrect conclusions about a treatment may be made. In this study, we aim to develop and apply robust statistical methods to address these challenges. Our methods, software, and results have the potential to inform and improve the design and analysis of future studies aimed at diabetes prevention by identifying when and how a surrogate marker can be used in future studies."

result (paradoxically) from the use of antibiotics. Our studies are performed under a One Health strategy that
aims to expand interdisciplinary collaboration in diverse aspects of healthcare for humans and other animals.
Our VA and University Affiliate teams are thus focused on elucidating pathogenic mechanisms in the anaerobic
human and veterinary pathogen Clostridioides difficile, as well as the diarrheal disease organisms
Enteropathogenic and Enterohemorrhagic E. coli. Ongoing studies include comprehensive epidemiological and
mechanistic interrogation of C. difficile infection (CDI). Specifically, we have (1) prospective CDI surveillance in
Southern Arizona VA and non-VA hospitals that has resulted in one of the only curated, fingerprinted and fully-
cataloged C. difficile biorepositories in the Southwestern US; (2) developed precision genomics and proteomics
approaches to identify factors contributing to the heightened virulence of newer strains of C. difficile; and (3)
leveraged the information from (1) and (2) to develop multiple, novel C. difficile anti-infectives including targeted
and bio-controlled live biotherapeutics as well as narrow-spectrum antimicrobials. Our VA Merit awards have
resulted in one issued, and two Provisional, Patents as of December 2020.
There are two over-arching goals of the activities described above. The first is to improve the health of Veterans
and, indeed, the elderly and immunocompromised, by developing safe, oral, cost-effective anti-infective
technologies that can transition expediently from the pre-clinical pipeline and into the community. The second is
to continue to partner with VA, national and international Collaborators and train mentees such that current efforts
can be channeled into a legacy plan for anti-infective research both at the SAVAHCS station as well as the
University Affiliate.
This renewal RCS application is thus envisaged as critical to the continued building of relationships within and
outside the Southern Arizona VA Healthcare System community. Our research record underscores the power of
cross-disciplinary science, and the RCS platform has enabled engagement with diverse research groups and
fostered new avenues of investigation. Core values that have been cultivated via these collaborations include
active listening, inclusive discussion and thoughtful communication.
Training and Mentoring is an integral aspect of the PIs’ professional vision, and the current RCS cycle has
provided opportunities to work with diverse and outstanding trainees and mentees. These have included (and
continue to include) first-generation college students, members of under-represented minorities, early-career
Faculty, and Physician-Scientist trainees.
Taken together, RCS activities are envisioned to continue fostering focused and substantive contributions to the
betterment of Veterans’ health via the development of products and technologies aimed at ameliorating
healthcare-associated infections."
10881679,"Pneumocystis spp. are obligate fungal pathogens that cause a fatal pneumonia (PCP) in immunocompromised
hosts. Few drugs are effective against PCP and there have been no new therapies for its treatment in decades.
Typically, PCP has been associated with patients infected with HIV, however, the fulminate pneumonia, PCP,
and colonization with Pneumocystis jirovecii (the species infecting humans) are emerging clinical problems in
newly susceptible populations in the general and veterans’ populations including bone marrow recipients;
patients receiving immunotherapy for rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic inflammatory diseases; and cancer
chemo- and immunotherapies. The life cycle of Pneumocystis is suggested to contain both an asexual replication
cycle and a sexual cycle involving mating with subsequent formation of asci containing 8 ascospores (1). During
the previous Merit Review, we showed that echinocandin treatment of rodents infected with P. murina and P.
carinii, which target β-1,3-D-glucan synthesis (BG), depleted the asci which contain BG but large numbers of
non-BG expressing life cycle stages remained in the lungs and were unable to proliferate. We further
demonstrated that anidulafungin and caspofungin could prevent infection in a prophylactic model, suggesting
that formation of asci via the sexual cycle may be required for a productive infection (2). Analysis of gene
expression profiles of P. murina in mice treated with anidulafungin, showed strong upregulation of genes
associated with sexual replication, though the resulting infections were devoid of asci, the product of sexual
reproduction, suggesting that P. murina attempted to undergo sexual replication, but could not due to a lack of
BG. Based on these data, we posited that asci, and thus sexual replication, is required to facilitate progression
through the life cycle leading to a productive infection. We further posited that presence of asci is required for
transmission of Pneumocystis infection. In the present Merit Review, we will explore 2 critical but unanswered
questions that will lead to a deeper knowledge of the life cycle of Pneumocystis, and also suggest potential
vulnerabilities for targeted treatment concomitant with anidulafungin therapy: (1) Is sexual replication required
for completion of the life cycle of Pneumocystis? Tracking of the replication status of P. murina during
prolonged treatment with anidulafungin by global gene analysis, BG content, and microscopic methods will reveal
whether the non-BG expressing forms numbers remain: 1) static over time, 2) increase, or 3) decrease;
suggesting: 1) the lack of BG blocks replication; 2) that an asexual or alternative replication phase permits
survival of the fungi; or 3) the lack of sexual replication results in elimination of the infection. (2) Can sexual
replication rebound after cessation of prolonged anidulafungin treatment? Mice will be treated with
anidulafungin for up to 8 weeks, with 2 cessation time points. Mice in the cessation groups will be tracked for
microscopic, BG content, and gene expression evidence of asci formation and return of the pneumonia while
remaining under immunosuppression. Mice in the treated and cessation groups will be evaluated for their ability
to transmit the infection and the critical number of asci needed for transmission. All studies will be conducted in
male and female mice, recognizing sex as a biological variable. The echinocandins are clinically available in the
United States. Current monotherapy with any echinocandin for PCP is not warranted as withdrawal can result in
return of the pneumonia. The results of the proposed studies will have immediate clinical relevance by
determining the length of time viable Pneumocystis can remain in the lungs with concurrent anidulafungin
treatment, providing a rationale for duration of therapy with eradication as the goal. These experiments will also
identify whether immunosuppressed mice can transmit the infection after withdrawal of anidulafungin and if there
is a critical number of asci needed. Finally, the studies will elaborate the life cycle of Pneumocystis and suggest
new target strategies."
10881742,"This proposal is based on an analysis of serum from melanoma patients treated with the PD-1 antibody
nivolumab (NIVO) showing that high levels of IL-6 and acute phase reactants (APP) induced by IL-6 like C-
reactive protein (CRP) are associated with poor survival. We hypothesize that CRP and other APP induced
by IL-6 are associated with resistance to checkpoint inhibition in melanoma, and are immunosuppressive.
This is supported by our preliminary data showing that CRP levels are associated with low response rates
and short survival with NIVO or ipilimumab (IPI). IL-6 promotes the synthesis of CRP and other APPs from
the liver, and its levels are also associated with low response rates, short survival and therapeutic resistance
in patients receiving NIVO, IPI or combination immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Patients with low IL-6 at
baseline or after treatment with ICB have high response rates and long survivals. To overcome the immune
suppression observed with CRP and reverse ICB resistance associated with high IL-6, we will add the IL-6
receptor blocking antibody tocilizumab to IPI and NIVO in patients with metastatic melanoma. Our overarching
hypothesis is that levels of IL-6 and CRP in baseline serum and other biomarkers in serum, PBMCs and tumor
will predict efficacy and toxicity in a phase II trial of IPI/NIVO with tocilizumab and that IL-6 blockade will
augment the efficacy of, and reduce toxicity from combined ICB. These biomarkers will provide insight into
host/tumor mediators of ICB and help direct patients to the most effective immunotherapy based on their
baseline and on-treatment levels of IL-6/CRP and other biomarkers. Co-primary endpoints of the trial include
best overall response rate and toxicity since IL-6 blockade has also been shown to reduce immune-related
adverse events with immunotherapy. A Simon two-stage design trial will include 67 patients that will receive
the triple combination and will be supported by BMS. In this proposal, we wish to support the correlative
marker studies based on that phase II trial. Analyses of the serum, tumor and peripheral blood will be carried
out to establish biomarkers of efficacy and toxicity and help understand the basis for resistance to combination
ICB in melanoma based on three specific aims: 1. To determine if baseline levels, or on-treatment changes
in a serum mass spectrometry-MALDI-TOF protein signature and acute phase reactants and cytokines are
associated with response and toxicity in a phase II trial of IPI/NIVO with the IL-6 receptor blocking antibody
tocilizumab; 2. To determine if baseline or on-treatment changes in peripheral blood and tumor T cell
phenotype and function assessed by multi-parameter flow cytometry, Ab-Seq and IsoLight assays, peripheral
blood dendritic cell phenotype and function and tumor class I and II expression, PD-L1 levels and RNA seq
signatures are associated with response and toxicity in a phase II study of IPI/NIVO with tocilizumab; and 3.
To integrate the serum, peripheral blood and tumor biomarkers of aims 1 and 2 to assess if a consolidated
signature is associated with response and toxicity in a phase II study of IPI/NIVO with tocilizumab."

Age-related neurodegenerative diseases are an increasing health and economic threat for millions of people
each year. Genetic susceptibility, environmental exposures, and age can all increase the risk of developing
neurodegenerative conditions such as synucleinopathies and manganism. The ATPase ATP13A2 is
associated with multiple age-related neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson’s disease, the most
common synucleinopathy, Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, and manganism and may be an important
protein linking key neurodegenerative disease risk factors. Identification of gene-environment interactions
associated with neurodegeneration is an important step to early detection, prevention, and treatment. The
objective of this proposal is to determine how ATP13A2 is involved in mitochondrial maintenance and how it
interacts with environmental and genetic risk factors to cause neurodegeneration. It is hypothesized that
loss of ATP13A2 function makes neurons more vulnerable to manganese and alpha-synuclein toxicity
through mechanisms involved in mitochondrial maintenance including repair and clearance mechanisms.
Further, this disruption may interact with aging and protein accumulation to produce enhanced
neurodegeneration and behavioural dysfunction. Our recent data shows that loss of function of ATP13A2 in
mice leads to an enhanced response to manganese and increased pathology in the brain. Guided by
preliminary data this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the impact of
loss of ATP13A2 function on mitochondrial maintenance in vivo, 2) Assess the neurotoxic consequences of
Mn exposure in the presence of ATP13A2 loss on mitochondrial function in brain and periphery, and 3)
Identify the impact of loss of ATP13A2 function and increased alpha-synuclein burden on mitochondrial
maintenance and bioenergetics in vivo. Results from these studies are expected to have a positive impact
on our understanding of how gene-environment interactions can contribute to cellular dysfunction,
neurodegeneration, and behavioral impairments."
10878198,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the first-line psychological treatment for anxiety and obsessive
compulsive (OC) disorders, yet approximately half of patients who receive CBT fail to achieve sustained
clinical remission. Such failures are widespread but poorly studied and contribute to the escalating public
health burden of anxiety. To date, no reliable biomarker capable of detecting CBT non-response exists. In this
R01, we seek to fill this gap by collecting a battery of clinical, behavioral, self-report, and neural measurements
before, during, and after CBT in a large cohort of patients with anxiety and OC disorders and healthy controls.
Using these data, we will employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to build a model of CBT non-
response and to test the hypothesis that early changes in a specific biomarker, self-focused attention (SFA),
will represent a sensitive predictor and potential mechanism of CBT non-response. Prior research from our
group has identified a promising neuroimaging-based biomarker of SFA, characterized by abnormal resting
state functional connectivity between regions of the default mode network (DMN) and dorsal attention network
(DAN) in a transdiagnostic sample. Trait SFA showed sustained reductions by 6 weeks into treatment, which
tracked with clinical improvement, suggesting potential corresponding neural changes at that time. A common
limitation of prediction studies is that they typically assess predictors only at baseline, which provides limited
understanding of processes contributing to non-response and leaves unaddressed the question of what can be
done for those predicted to not respond. Given that for anxiety and OC disorders, substantial improvement
during CBT rapidly diminishes if not achieved early in treatment, we hypothesize that early changes in DMN-
DAN connectivity may represent a mechanism of non-response and contribute to an early warning system that
can be used to identify individuals at risk for suboptimal CBT response. This study will first establish the
reliability and construct validity of DMN-DAN connectivity as a measure of SFA, which is distinct from related
cognitive constructs, such as rumination, worry, and more general attentional mechanisms, such as attentional
control and orienting, in a subgroup of 50 patients and 50 matched healthy controls. Next, we will provide 12
weeks of standard CBT for 110 patients with anxiety and OC disorders. Neuroimaging data will be acquired at
baseline, week 6, and post-treatment to assess changes in functional connectivity throughout treatment. As
predictions of CBT response are unlikely to be a function of SFA alone, we will develop supervised machine
learning models that accommodate the hypothesized DMN-DAN connectivity measure, plus other data-driven
features, to predict response at post-treatment. Since our goal is not to use MRI scans clinically, the use of
machine learning to identify the strongest predictors of CBT non-response from a large set of multimodal
features throughout CBT may reveal potential proxy measures that do not require neuroimaging. This study will
reveal potential mechanistic indicators of CBT non-response that can guide treatment selection and planning."
10878362,"Title: Glial roles in experience-dependent critical period remodeling
Summary
We propose glia actively prune brain circuits to optimize connectivity based on early-life sensory experience.
Drosophila approaches are used to identify molecular mechanisms of activity-dependent glial pruning restricted
to this short critical period. We propose these glial mechanisms go awry in several newly-linked disease states
of intellectual and autism spectrum disorders, including Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Noonan syndrome (NS),
LEOPARD syndrome (i.e. NS with Multiple Lentigines; NSML), and Neurobeachin (NBEA) associated autism
spectrum disorder (ASD). Our plan is to test the role of glia in experience-dependent circuit pruning in normal
and disease states, and to order glial mechanisms of recruitment, infiltration, engulfment and phagocytosis. We
employ targeted CRISPR knockout, conditional gene manipulations, and transgenic brain circuit connectivity
mapping to dissect neuron-to-glia signaling and glia function in this sensory experience-dependent remodeling.
We use timed olfactory cues to activate odorant receptor neurons, downstream projection neurons, and central
learning/memory center Kenyon cells, to test glial phagocytosis activity during and following the critical period.
In Aim 1, we block glial phagocytic function at multiple levels to test experience-dependent connectivity pruning
throughout this defined brain circuitry. We use transgenic single neuron synaptic labeling to visualize glial
phagocytosis via transmission electron microscopy. To test downstream activity-dependent mechanisms, we
use both excitatory and inhibitory optogenetic tools, as well as transgenic blockage of neurotransmission, in
hierarchical circuit studies of synaptic connectivity is sequential brain neuropils. This aim systematically tests
glial pruning in normal juvenile brains. In Aim 2, we dissect glia-specific Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein
(FMRP) roles in experience-dependent brain circuit pruning. We assay FMRP requirements in glial infiltration
phagocytosis using combined light microscopy and ultrastructural imaging. We test the FMRP-dependent
neuron-to-glia signaling mechanisms of glial recruitment and phagocytosis during experience-dependent circuit
remodeling. This work distinguishes FMRP roles within glia and neurons to understand FXS disease model
impairments in critical period brain circuit remodeling. In Aim 3, we test the roles of FMRP translational targets,
and consequent regulation of PKA/ERK signaling pathways. We test roles of 1) the direct FMRP mRNA target
Rugose/NBEA causative in autism spectrum disorder, which acts as a regulatory PKA anchor, and 2) the direct
FMRP mRNA target Corkscrew/SHP2 causative in the two Noonan syndromes of intellectual disability, which
is an ERK pathway regulatory phosphatase. We use separation of phases-based activity reporter of kinase
(SPARK) biosensors to image experience-dependent PKA/ERK signaling during the early-life critical period.
Taken together, this research program dissects gene-environment interactions in normal critical period brain
circuit pruning by glial phagocytes, with translational links to new molecular mechanism intersections between
Fragile X syndrome, two related Noonan syndromes, and Neurobeachin-associated autism spectrum disorder."
10886397,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Vascular and lymphatic systems have emerged as attractive therapeutic targets in a variety of diseases.
Stimulating angiogenesis accelerates wound healing and tissue regeneration after myocardial infarction whereas
inhibition of angiogenesis suppresses tumor growth1 and progression of intraocular neovascular diseases.
Likewise, stimulating lymphangiogenesis aids in the treatment of secondary lymphedema, prevents
atherosclerosis and could promote cancer immunotherapy. Endothelial cells (ECs) are key components of
arterial, venous, and lymphatic vasculatures. Studies in mice identified the transcription factor NR2F2, also
known as COUP-TFII, as the key regulator of EC fate. However, major gaps exist in our knowledge of the cellular
and molecular mechanisms by which NR2F2 regulates EC specification. Which EC subsets, developmental
transitions and molecular networks are targeted by NR2F2 is unknown. NR2F2 and its homolog NR2F1 are
members of the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) family of transcription factors. NHR activities are controlled by
small molecules derived from endogenous metabolism or diet. Recently, we identified 1-deoxysphingosines as
natural ligands for NR2F1/2. Although 1-deoxysphingosines have been detected in tissues, no physiological
roles have yet been proposed for these metabolites - they are considered toxic byproducts of sphingolipid
biosynthesis resulting from mutations in subunits of the SPT complex. Our study is the first to suggest that these
metabolites have a physiological function as regulators of NR2F1/2-mediated transcription. The mechanistic
understanding of how NR2F1/2:1-deoxysphingosine axis regulates EC development would yield knowledge
needed to modulate blood/lymphatic vessel development in research and clinical settings. In this proposal, we
will (1) define the cellular and molecular networks regulated by NR2F1/2 and its ligand, 1-deoxysphingosine,
during arterial venous, and lymphatic specification of hESCs, (2) delineate molecular pathways that modulate 1-
deoxysphingosine synthesis and uptake and identify major physiological sources of this metabolites in vivo, and
(3) define the structure of ligand-bound NR2F2 LBD and validate ligand-receptor interactions. The work proposed
is significant because it will identify molecular pathways that modulate NR2F2 transcriptional activity thus
contributing to an understanding how NR2F2-mediated transcriptional networks regulate development and
physiology of vascular and lymphatic systems. This knowledge will be instrumental for developing ligand analogs
that can act as chemical modulators of NR2F2 activity under normal and disease conditions. Our approach is
innovative because we will develop new concepts and methodologies that could be adapted to understand the
molecular bases of NHR-mediated transcription and to search for ligands of other orphan NHRs."
10886398,"Abstract
Research on environmental risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has largely focused on maternal
gestational exposures and on exposures in the early postnatal period. The possibility that paternal
preconception factors play important etiological roles in the disorder has not been extensively studied. A
possible role for paternal factors in ASD is suggested based on the consistently robust associations observed
between ASD and paternal age. In addition, ASD has been associated with alterations in epigenetic marks and
related gene expression across several somatic tissues, suggesting that one possible etiologic mechanism
could be through effects on sperm epigenetic imprinting. Exposure to ambient air pollution has been
associated in animal studies with alteration in sperm epigenetic marks that can be transmitted to offspring and
affect phenotype. Human data has also linked exposure to air pollution, certain comorbidities, and use of some
medications with reduced sperm quality parameters, possibly due to inheritable epigenetic effects. My aim in
the proposed work is to evaluate the role of paternal factors in the etiology of ASD. Specifically, I will evaluate
whether exposure to air pollution during the spermatogenesis period preceding a conception is associated with
an increased risk of autism in the offspring (aim 1); whether paternal comorbidities and their pharmacologic
treatments have additive or synergistic effects with air pollution on ASD risk given that similar biologic
pathways have been implicated in these different sets of exposures (aim 2); and whether exposure to air
pollution causes DNA methylation changes in sperm overall and specifically in ASD related loci, which will
inform mechanistic pathways (aim 3). For these goals, I will use data from a large Israeli birth cohort of nearly
half a million children with detailed demographic and clinical information, and will also collect semen
biospecimens from subgroup of men attending a large IVF clinic. Air pollution exposure will be estimated using
state-of-the-art satellite-derived air pollution exposure models based on geocoded residential addresses. The
proposed work will make novel translational and mechanistic contributions to ASD through identification of
specific paternal factors and biological pathways that cause, exacerbate, or mediate ASD risk. Findings
stemming from the proposed work will help guide interventions to reduce exposure to harmful environmental
toxicants or attenuate their downstream effects. In addition to the research goals, the proposed work has a
strong training component in epigenetic and pharmacologic epidemiology and in statistical genomics that
would substantially advance my skillset in using innovative study designs and analytic approaches in
exposomic research of heterogenous risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders using observational data.
The proposed training and mentoring will be instrumental for advancing my goal of becoming an independent
researcher in the field of environmental neuroepidemiology and precision environmental health."
10886891,"Chronic excessive alcohol drinking can lead to serious liver injury. Alcoholic liver disease or
alcohol-associated/related liver disease (ALD) is characterized by steatosis, inflammation, and
fibrosis, which can lead to cirrhosis, cancer and multiple complications. While significant progress has
been made, much has yet to be learnt about the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver injury to
develop effective therapy and diagnosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are intracellular vesicles
released by cells into the extracellular space in response to various physiological and pathological
signals. Increased production of EVs in ALD has been found to contribute to the pathogenesis of ALD
in a significant way. But the mechanism of enhanced EV production under chronic alcohol exposure
is not known.
 On the other hand, autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process, and its disturbance can
contribute to ALD with the molecular pathway undefined. Interestingly, we find that EVs produced in
autophagy deficient mice carry the same molecular signatures as those generated by alcohol-fed
mice. Our preliminary findings support a hypothesis that EV production in ALD condition could be
driven by a unique regulatory pathway involving autophagy inhibition, activation of NRF2 and
upregulation of SDCBP2 and that these molecules can have functional impact on the liver pathologies
via the EVs. To examine this hypothesis, we have proposed two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will
determine the mechanism of EV production in a mouse model of ALD. Here we will examine how
autophagy deficiency following chronic alcohol exposure could promote EVs production. We will
examine the molecular link from NRF2 to SDCBP2, both of which are elevated in expression in
genetically modified autophagy deficient livers and in chronic alcohol-fed livers. Unlike the steady
generation of EVs in basal conditions, this is a regulated pathway to enhance EV production in
response to the pathological stimulation of alcohol uptake. In Aim 2, we will determine the
contribution of SDCBP2 via enhanced EV production to alcoholic liver pathogenesis. We will examine
the effect on inflammation via M1 polarization and other liver pathology.
These studies will elucidate an important mechanism that regulate EV production in ALD (a short-
term goal), which will significantly advance the field as the identification of new molecular targets
could potentially stimulate therapeutic and diagnostic development in future R01-based studies (an
intermediate term goal), leading to improved management of ALD (a long-term goal)."
10886898,"Project Summary/Abstract
The onset of sensory experience transforms immature cortical networks into mature representations that support
reliable discrimination of behaviorally relevant stimuli. Cortical responses encode stimuli by the profile of activity
across a population of neurons (population response). To provide stimulus information, population responses
must be different across stimuli and also reliable across presentations of the same stimulus. Novel techniques
that measure activity chronically across large neuronal populations with single-trial resolution in developing
animals will now help us define how reliable population responses mature with experience. This question is
fundamental as a reliable transmission of information is critical for perception and cognition. The candidate’s
previous work shows that a developmental alignment between the structure of feedforward inputs and recurrent
connectivity in superficial layers 2/3 of the ferret primary visual cortex (V1) contributes to the emergence of a
reliable representation of edge orientation following the onset of visual experience. During the K99 period, the
candidate will expand on these initial findings addressing two key questions. First, the candidate will use novel
methods he has designed for 3-dimensional electrode array recordings in developing ferrets to resolve the
sequence of changes in response properties and connectivity across layers 2/3 and layer 4, the main source of
feedforward inputs to layers 2/3, that result in feedforward-recurrent alignment after experience. Second, the
candidate will use chronic two-photon imaging to resolve if the maturation of inhibitory responses in layers 2/3
contributes to increase population response reliability in this layer. To achieve these goals, the candidate will be
mentored by Dr. David Fitzpatrick, a world-renowned authority on vision development and an expert in imaging
techniques. Through collaborations with Dr. Ting at the Allen Institute and Dr. Yasuda at the Max Planck Florida
Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), the candidate will develop novel genetic constructs to disrupt activity-
dependent plasticity in specific cortical layers or neuronal types in ferret V1. As an independent investigator, the
candidate will use these tools to investigate how sensory experience refines cortical circuits to produce a mature
representation at the neuronal population level. As a first step towards this novel scientific direction, the candidate
will consult with Dr. Inagaki at MPFI to resolve whether experience-driven synaptic plasticity in layer 4 is
necessary for the emergence of reliable population responses in layers 2/3. This methodological approach
differentiates the candidate’s research from Dr. Fitzpatrick’s, which focuses on single-cell synaptic architecture
and response properties. To acquire the professional skills essential for a successful transition to independence,
the candidate will consult with Dr. Namboodiri, who will guide the candidate’s plan for training in professional
development, fostering his success as a young investigator. Throughout the project period, the mentor,
collaborators, and consultants will work together as an advisory committee to guide the candidate as he improves
his research, secures an independent research position, and establishes a successful lab at his new institution."

NIH reports that progress has been made (UNITE 2021), but a full account of career challenges faced by AAorB scientists has been hampered by lack of access to data on science faculty. This study will construct a dataset that identifies the race, gender, academic field, academic rank, publications, citations and grants of individual scientists by linking data on over 2 million individual faculty from Academic Analytics for the years 2009-2023, the NSF’s Survey of Earned Doctorates, NIH Reporter, the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, and web searches. These data will be used to examine race/ethnicity differences in the career paths of scientists at research-intensive universities. Aim 1 of this study will create the Demographic Academic Careers data set housed in a data enclave at National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics so the research community can make use of this rich data in other Science of Science research. Aim 2 will document the race/ethnicity distribution of faculty at 427 research-intensive universities and medical schools across the United States and their impact on students of color. This aim will examine whether institutions with more faculty of color produce more undergraduate and graduate students of color. Aim 3 will examine race/ethnicity differences in promotion to associate and full professor and the potential double-bind of gender and race/ethnicity. This aim will examine whether the race/ethnicity NIH funding gaps contribute to similar promotion gaps. Aim 4 will examine race/ethnicity differences in the age of research independence and funding longevity. Researchers have examined these topics in the aggregate or for women (Levitt & Levitt 2017; Hechtman et al 2018),yet the same has not been done by race/ethnicity. The longitudinal data developed in Aim 1 is ideal for this kind of study. Aim 5 will examine gender and race/ethnicity differences in NIH R01 renewals (Type 2) awards. Researchers have documented that women are less likely to receive Type 2 renewals (Ley and Hamilton 2008, Pohlhaus et al 2011). Ginther et al (2018) found that AAorB investigators were also at a disadvantage in renewals. This project will determine whether publications, citations, prior funding, and institutional affiliations explain these differences."
10889235,"ABSTRACT
Despite the dramatic improvement in HIV-associated morbidity and mortality with combination antiretroviral
therapy (ART), HIV remains a chronic disease. The major barrier to HIV cure is the long-term persistence of
multiple, latent viral reservoirs capable of reactivation in the absence of ART. Any effort to eradicate these
reservoirs as part of a cure initiative requires understanding of the dynamics and control of HIV reactivation
and replication in tissues and cells harboring the virus long-term.
Our work has focused on understanding the mechanisms and implications of HIV infection of the kidney. We
demonstrated that HIV infects renal tubule epithelial cells (RTEs) in vitro via direct contact with HIV-infected T
cells and macrophages. Viral nucleic acid sequence analysis from in vivo derived RTEs compared to blood
derived sequences demonstrated that the kidney represents a unique viral compartment. Furthermore, we
showed that people with HIV (PWH) shed viral RNA in urine, and we have optimized approaches to detect and
amplify HIV sequences from fresh and archived urine specimens. We found that some urine-derived HIV
sequences were closely related to HIV sequences amplified from RTEs, supporting those cells as one of the
sources of urine viruses. Viral detection in the urine allows for repeated sampling of the kidney compartment,
which can be particularly useful in viral rebound studies. Additionally, in all of the PLWH we have analyzed so
far, we amplified several identical HIV-1 sequences in urine, raising the possibility of clonal expansion of
infected renal cells. Indeed, we recently reported that proliferation is one of the cellular fates observed in both
actively and latently infected RTEs in vitro, together with hypertrophy and cell-death. Whether proliferation of
infected renal epithelial cells contributes to HIV persistence in the kidney is unknown.
The studies proposed here will define: 1) the long-term persistence of HIV in the kidney through the analysis of
samples collected prospectively from PWH undergoing HIV+ to HIV+ kidney transplantation; 2) the reactivation
potential of HIV in urine following ART interruption in terminally ill PWH who have consented to prospective
follow-up as part of a rapid autopsy protocol; 3) the ability of patient-derived renal epithelial cells to carry
replication competent virus; 4) the role of APOL1 kidney disease risk variants in RTE and podocyte infection;
and 5) how HIV infection influences individual cell fate and potential for clonal expansion of infected RTEs. We
hypothesize that renal epithelial cells serve as a long-term reservoir for HIV. Understanding the mechanisms of
HIV persistence and reactivation in the kidney will inform cure strategies and further define renal pathogenesis
in PLWH."

 This proposal describes a mentored career development plan and research proposal that is designed to
facilitate my transition to becoming an independent clinician scientist with specialization in the genetic
determinants of epilepsy and underlying molecular mechanisms of epileptogenesis. Epilepsy affects 1% of the
population and results in significant morbidity. Despite increasing discoveries of genetic etiologies that increase
epilepsy susceptibility, this information has not led to disease modifying treatments. A better understanding of
the mechanisms of epileptogenesis as a result of genetic changes may bring us closer to developing disease
modifying treatments. Alterations in intrinsic cell excitability, neuronal organization and synaptic function are
potential mechanisms leading to increased network excitability seen in epilepsy. Deletion of the 15q11.2 locus
is found in 1.4% of genetic epilepsies, making it one of the most common susceptibility loci identified to date
and it results in haplo-insufficiency of the CYFIP1 gene. The CYFIP1 gene regulates activity dependent
translation at excitatory synapses as well as dynamic actin rearrangements required for normal neurogenesis
and synaptic development. I hypothesize that increased seizure susceptibility and neuropsychiatric disorders in
patients with 15q11.2 CNV results from alterations in CYFIP1 expression. In this application, I propose a
research plan that will evaluate the functional consequences and underlying mechanisms of CYFIP1-mediated
changes using a combination of in vitro human iPSC and in vivo mouse models. My mentorship team includes
Nicholas Maragakis, Dwight Bergles, and Carl Stafstrom at Johns Hopkins University and Hongjun Song at the
University of Pennsylvania. I have identified 4 short term training goals and 2 long term goals for this funding
period. My short term goals are to (1) develop in vitro humanized models to validate molecular mechanisms of
epilepsy and excitation / inhibition (E/I) imbalance in the context of human genetic backgrounds; (2) develop
and manipulate animal models to probe epilepsy susceptibility and E/I imbalance (3) receive training in
advanced electrophysiological techniques, and (4) improve my skills in statistically sound experimental design
and analysis. My long term goals are to (1) develop an independent research career investigating the
mechanisms of epilepsy in the wider context of neurodevelopmental disabilities and (2) further develop a
clinical niche in the care of patients with genetically determined epilepsy. My career development plan and
mentorship team will allow me to achieve these goals. The research plan will establish complementary in vitro
and in vivo model systems to investigate underlying mechanisms, screen for therapeutic interventions and
develop a platform that is generalizable to the investigation of other genetic risk factors for epilepsy. These
studies will provide a foundation for my R01 submission in which I will examine genotype dependent changes
in E/I balance to screen for new drug targets and predict drug response in vivo and in vitro and the mentorship
and training that I receive will facilitate my transition to independent research in my own laboratory."

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutation of the CFTR gene and is one of the most common inherited
childhood diseases, impacting 1 in 4,000 children born in the US (www.cff.org). Today, CF disease symptoms
in patients with the most common mutation (∆F508 CFTR) can be improved with three different drug
combinations. However, the drugs have negative side effects that reduce patient compliance to therapeutic
regimens and pose long-term health risks. Additionally, many other common CF-causing mutations respond
poorly or not at all to any of the current CF drugs, leaving CF patients carrying these mutations only with
symptomatic therapy. Efforts to develop new compounds for such CF variants are hampered by the lack of
protein structures that would reveal the conformational defects of these variants, mostly due to technical
difficulties in expressing and purifying sufficient quantities of these unstable proteins. To characterize the
conformational defects of misfolded CFTR variants and to aid in the development of new therapies, we
previously developed Covalent Protein Painting (CPP), a novel method for in vivo structural characterization of
proteins by mass spectrometry. Here, we propose to develop a more sensitive and multiplexable CPP method,
named bioTMT-CPP, that will facilitate detection and comparison of CFTR conformational changes between
samples. The new method will facilitate the characterization of conformational defects in misfolded CFTR
variants that are refractory to current therapies. Furthermore, our approach has the potential to pinpoint drug
binding sites and identify the mechanism of action of current CF drugs, which remain unknown for three of the
four active compounds. Such knowledge will help to rationalize drug combination therapies. We also propose
to functionally characterize a novel CFTR conformation that we discovered by CPP and that is attained by
misfolded and inactive CFTR, likely during protein trafficking. Insight into the molecular mechanisms that
stabilize this conformation as well as those that release it into an active conformation will be invaluable for
further corrector drug development and will benefit all CF patients."
10896248,"Not only do fear-based disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) quintuple the rate of suicide
relative to those without these disorders, but they also increase the magnitude of age-related cognitive decline
and double the risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias in older adults. Fear-based
disorders like PTSD are linked to fear memories. Due to the seemingly indelible and hyperactive properties of
such fear memories, fear-based disorders can worsen with age. Although normative aging and Alzheimer’s
disease have dissociable trajectories, one factor that negatively impacts cognitive aging and Alzheimer’s disease
is the comorbidity of PTSD. Perturbations in the functional circuitry supporting fear memory extinction are also
key neural mechanisms of PTSD. A critical anatomical structure within the neural circuitry underlying this
dysfunctional processing is the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which is considered an integrative hub as it receives
sensory and contextual information from the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. While much of the current
scientific focus on cognitive aging and Alzheimer’s disease centers on the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus,
little is known about the underlying mechanisms of BLA dysfunction in aging, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and the
impact of co-occurring PTSD. One pathological process common to these disorders is underlying
neuroinflammation. Importantly, ketogenic and ketone ester diets are known to ameliorate hyperactivity,
inflammation, fear-based disorders, and show promise as treatments for the contributing factors to cognitive
aging and AD. To date, no study has investigated how aging and AD act in concert to further impair the BLA’s
role in extinguishing hyperactive fear memories (a central component of PTSD). To address the current gap in
knowledge, this proposal will leverage the TgF344AD rat model of AD to understand the contribution of BLA
inflammation, cellular dysfunction, and synaptic circuit impairment to underlying mechanisms of PTSD. Recent
data from the lab suggests, relative to young wild type rats, aging and AD impairs fear extinction and recall, and
furthermore, the BLA in aged and AD rats is hyperactive. As such, the overarching hypothesis of this
proposal is that hyperactive fear memory, the core element of PTSD, increases with aging and is
accelerated in AD due to progressive inflammatory-driven neurophysiological deficits in the BLA. In
Specific Aim 1, this proposal will leverage a rodent fear conditioning protocol that models a critical component of
PTSD (i.e., the inability to extinguish hyperactive fear memory) and assess how aging and Alzheimer’s disease
contribute to BLA cellular dysfunction (both ex vivo and in vivo during fear extinction) and inflammation.
Additionally, in Specific Aim 2, this proposal will determine if a ketone ester dietary intervention (known to have
anti-epileptic and anti-inflammatory properties) or BLA inactivation can facilitate fear memory extinction and
improve BLA hyperactivity and pathology in age and AD. The outcomes of this proposal will be critical to
developing translational strategies to combat poor quality of life outcomes in older adults."
10888978,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target BCR-ABL have transformed Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)
from a deadly condition with a poor prognosis to a manageable chronic disease with a life expectancy close to
that of the normal population, resulting in an increase in the prevalence of CML that is expected to continue to
rise until at least 2050. This success is driven by newer generations of BCR-ABL TKIs with improved potency.
Some BCR-ABL TKIs however, most notably dasatinib, ponatinib and nilotinib, have been associated with
cardiovascular toxicity including increased risk of arterial thrombotic events such as coronary artery thrombosis,
peripheral arterial occlusion, and cerebrovascular accidents. Our lab previously helped develop a proteomic
approach which identified a phospho-proteomic signature of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)
treated with BCR-ABL TKIs that predicts clinical vascular toxicity and correlates with endothelial cell (EC)
dysfunction in vitro. ECs line the vessel lumen and protect the vasculature from pathologic platelet adhesion and
thrombosis. Conversely, EC dysfunction that impairs the ability of ECs to heal also exposes prothrombotic factors
on the basement membrane that, along with EC upregulation of pro-coagulant proteins, are unexplored
mechanisms by which BCR-ABL TKI toxicity could contribute to increased risk of arterial thrombosis. Asciminib,
a novel allosteric BCR-ABL inhibitor, has expanded the landscape of treatment in CML and in 2021 received
FDA approval for patients who have failed two prior BCR-ABL TKIs. The cardiovascular safety profile of asciminib
and its effects on ECs in vitro is unknown, nor are mitigating strategies available for BCR-ABL TKI vascular
toxicity. New preliminary data from our lab support that asciminib is less toxic than ponatinib, dasatinib, and
nilotinib in a HUVEC scratch would healing assay in vitro, that ponatinib impairs mouse carotid artery endothelial
cell wound healing in vivo, and that phospho-proteomic screening can identify drugs that “reverse” the toxic BCR-
ABL TKI phospho-proteomic signature and improve EC survival after BCR-ABL TKI exposure. We propose to
use in vitro assays to compare the EC toxicity of asciminib to imatinib (non-toxic BCR-ABL TKI), ponatinib,
nilotinib, and dasatinib (all known to be toxic to ECs), and explore the EC toxicity of these compounds in vivo in
a mouse carotid artery wire injury model. We also propose to use proteomics to determine the phospho-
proteomic profile of HUVECs treated with asciminib, screen approved cardiometabolic drugs for their ability to
“reverse” the phospho-proteomic EC signature of toxic BCR-ABL TKIs, and test whether the target drugs
identified by our screen can reverse EC toxicity in vitro and in vivo. The results of the studies in this proposal will
provide valuable information about the potential vascular toxicity of asciminib, a novel therapy for CML, provide
a more comprehensive understanding of the vascular toxicity of current BCR-ABL TKIs, and identify rapidly
translatable agents to treat or prevent vascular toxicity in CML survivors."

Screen and incidentally detected intermediate risk indeterminant pulmonary nodules (IPN) represent a clinical
dilemma for which there is little consensus about appropriate follow up due to a lack of sensitive and specific
approaches for the detection of lung cancer absent invasive tissue sampling, and concerns about costs and
harms from invasive tissue sampling in this large clinical population. Minimally invasive approaches that could
accurately reclassify individuals from the intermediate risk group (5-65% risk of malignancy) to either low (< 5%)
or high (>65%) risk would reduce uncertainty and transform the diagnostic workup of intermediate risk IPN.
Developing, evaluating, standardizing, and validating such minimally invasive biomarkers so that they are ready
for clinical use is the goal of the proposed BU-UCLA Lung Cancer Biomarker Characterization Center (BCC). In
previous EDRN-funded work we established lung-cancer associated gene expression patterns in nasal
epithelium collected with a swab from the inferior turbinate as a lung cancer biomarker. A test based on this
innovative approach to lung cancer detection is being launched for clinical use as a CLIA LDT by our long-time
collaborator Veracyte, Inc., which is participating in this BCC. We will evaluate the nasal biomarker for lung
cancer in the setting of intermediate risk IPN. To further improve the ability to clinically discriminate benign from
malignant intermediate risk IPN, the BU-UCLA Lung Cancer Biomarker Discovery Lab embedded within the BCC
will develop and test lung cancer detection approaches that incorporate detection of circulating tumor cells (CTC)
using a CLIA LDT assay from our collaborator LungLife AI, Inc. as well as blood based immune biomarkers,
advanced imaging biomarkers, and refined nasal gene expression biomarkers. We will additionally determine if
longitudinal biomarker assessment improves lung cancer detection over cross-sectional measurements.
Promising assays will be refined, standardized, and validated by the BU-UCLA Lung Cancer Biomarker
Reference Lab embedded within the BCC to advance them toward clinical adoption. These studies are enabled
by biospecimens and imaging data that are being prospectively collected from diverse populations of patients
undergoing workup for intermediate risk IPN in several large-scale ongoing clinical studies including VA LPOP,
DECAMP 1-Plus, and UCLA IDx; lung cancer research programs at UCLA and Lahey; and our EDRN
collaborators at Nashville VA and Vanderbilt. The BU-UCLA Lung Cancer BCC Team has the required multi-
disciplinary expertise in lung cancer, translational and clinical pulmonary medicine, biomarker discovery, clinical
assay development, biostatistics, clinical epidemiology, pathology, imaging, artificial intelligence, biological
sciences, bioinformatics, genomics, and complex scientific program management to accomplish these goals. An
Administrative Core embedded within the BCC will ensure that the BCC delivers on its aim to substantially
advance novel lung cancer biomarkers from discovery to clinical application and make significant contributions
to the Early Detection Research Network."

little is known about TAMs and neutrophils in pHGGs. pHGGs more commonly arise in infratentorial locations
like the brainstem, beyond the cerebral hemispheres as seen in adults. pHGGs also harbor distinct histone
mutations not found in adults. This raises the question of whether pHGGs possess a distinct constituency of
TAMs due to their unique genetic landscapes and locations.
Using human pHGG tissue samples and NanoString RNA sequencing, we demonstrate brainstem/midline
pHGGs (DMG) and murine diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) possess higher inflammatory scores and
increased neutrophil scores compared to hemispheric pHGGs, which are associated with shorter patient survival.
When examining only human hemispheric pHGGs, our results revealed two patient subsets with high and low
inflammatory scores. Patients with a high inflammatory score had significantly shorter survival times compared
to those with low inflammatory scores. We also show that human pHGGs possess high infiltration of IBA1+
TAMs, which are the most abundant non-neoplastic component of the pHGG tumor microenvironment (TME).
Our preliminary data utilizing mouse models to recapitulate pHGG in newborn immunocompetent mice combined
with various histone mutations in biologically relevant locations demonstrate murine tumors are strikingly similar
to their human counterparts with regard to their inflammatory immune profile and myeloid cell infiltration. Using
PDGFB and PDGFA as driver mutations to generate hemispheric pHGG in mice, we were able to recapitulate
human pHGGs with high and low inflammatory scores. We showed that in comparison to PDGFA-driven tumors,
PDGFB tumors have a higher inflammatory score, increased infiltration of monocytes from the blood, and shorter
survival time of tumor-bearing mice. We identify CCL3 as a potential key chemokine for CCR1/CCR5-positive
monocytes and CXCL1 for CXCR2-positive neutrophil recruitment in pHGG. Together, these results provide
strong rationale to extend our studies to understand how specific histone mutations and tumor locations influence
myeloid cell infiltration and how these cells promote pHGG growth. The outcome of these studies will: (i) reveal
the molecular and functional diversity of the myeloid compartment of pHGG; (ii) determine how distinct myeloid
subsets and myeloid-specific genes influence tumor growth and the TME; (iii) provide insight into how myeloid
subsets influence, and are affected by driver mutations, pediatric-specific histone mutations, and tumor location
(hemisphere versus brainstem). This study will also determine whether targeting monocyte and neutrophil
infiltration will be a viable therapeutic avenue for exploitation in pHGG."

provided research training to 221 Fogarty Global Health Fellows and Scholars, who to date have generated
866 publications. With this competitive renewal, we propose to expand training activities aimed at increasing
the likelihood of trainees becoming independent global health scientists and leaders. We have modified our
consortium name to reflect this new emphasis: Northern Pacific Global Health Leadership, Education, And
Development for Early-career Researchers (NPGH LEADERs). We propose to continue partnerships based in
nine countries: Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Cameroon, Liberia, Peru, Thailand, Nepal, and India. To achieve our
objective of developing the next generation of independent global health scientists and leaders, we will offer
12-month research and leadership training with the following specific aims: Aim 1: To ensure excellence in
scientific inquiry, trainees will complete a comprehensive curriculum in global health research, including how to
frame novel, relevant, and feasible scientific questions, prepare detailed scientific protocols, and plan for the
implementation of a mentored research project in a low- or middle-income country. Aim 2: To address the
challenges of research implementation in a low-resource setting, trainees will follow an explicit, expedited,
supported, and mentored progression from research planning to pragmatic implementation and process
management. Aim 3: To prepare trainees for careers as independent scientists and to excel in both leadership
and management, we will support trainees in development of individualized “road maps” to define the research,
management and leadership skills necessary for their transition into independent investigators. We will also
expand alumni support for alumni to further strengthen the scientific and leadership skills necessary for
transitioning to the next generation of independent global health scientists. The four U.S. universities, as well
as Indiana University - an associated partner since 2016 - have committed cost-sharing funds totaling
$565,000 to increase recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities and a second year of fellowship
for the most productive fellows. We anticipate supporting at least 10 trainees each year, for a total of 50
trainees over the five year grant period; 60% of trainees will be at the U.S. postdoctoral level and 40% will
implement HIV-related research projects."
10871899,"Project Summary:
Mouse genetic tools based on Cre recombinase and Cas9 nuclease have been applied for cell/tissue-specific
gene knockout and cell lineage tracing. These tools enable control of gene expression and genome
engineering to uncover detailed biology in a number of systems. However, the lack of precise spatiotemporal
control hinders the broader applications of these tools. In this proposal, we will develop a new set of mouse
genetic tools to address this issue. Then we propose to apply this system to investigate the establishment of
the adult bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool in vivo. Because HSCs self-renew and differentiate
into all blood cell lineages throughout life, they are the basis for life-saving bone marrow transplantation in
clinics. Therefore, understanding HSC biology has important translational implications. The establishment of
the adult bone marrow HSC pool is essential for life-long hematopoiesis. However, how the adult bone marrow
HSC pool is established has not been addressed. The lack of appropriate genetic tools to study HSCs at the
clonal level in vivo has been a major hurdle. Our novel genetic tools will allow tracing HSCs at the clonal level
in vivo. If successful, the results will significantly advance the field by directly addressing how the adult bone
marrow HSC pool is established. Also, our proposed novel technologies will be widely applicable to various
research fields beyond hematopoiesis to address fundamental questions."
10872287,"Project Summary/Abstract
Spontaneous speech undergoes subtle but significant changes years, or even decades, before the onset of
dementia. Signs of change in speech, or speech markers, include the use of syntactically simpler structures,
reduced idea density, and more filler words, nonspecific nouns, and higher frequency words (Berisha et al.,
2015; Snowdon, 1996). Such changes are potentially useful clinically for early diagnosis of dementia and are
more broadly interesting for understanding normal and impaired language production. The proposed studies
will investigate speech markers of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) prior to diagnosis (i.e., in prodromal AD) in
Spanish-English bilinguals. Speech markers have not been investigated in bilinguals even though use of two
languages might magnify the cognitive mechanisms underlying speech production and sensitivity to prodromal
AD. Bilinguals may exhibit unique speech markers not found in monolinguals, and some of the same markers
as monolinguals but with differential sensitivity across their two languages. When bilinguals speak, they must
choose which language to speak and must avoid interference from the language they are not using, tasks that
may be especially difficult when speaking in the relatively less proficient, or non-dominant, language (L2). By
contrast, speech in the dominant language, or L1, is relatively more automatic, at least in some aspects, and is
also the language in which bilinguals may have their highest level of semantic knowledge and linguistic skill.
These key differences between L1 and L2 lead to different expectations about which aspects of speech in each
language should be most sensitive to cognitive decline (Aim 1) and most strongly correlated with other
domains of cognitive functioning (Aim 2). To test these hypotheses, in Aim 1, we will examine archival data of
spontaneous speech in bilinguals who were cognitively healthy at the time of testing but years later developed
a diagnosis of Probable AD to identify linguistic markers of prodromal AD in L1 and L2. In Aim 2, we will
prospectively examine relationships between L1 and L2 spontaneous speech markers and general cognitive
functioning (measured by a battery of neuropsychological tests) and will test the hypothesis that time-
pressured picture-naming, a recently identified speech marker of dementia risk (Stiver et al., 2021) may be a
better speech marker of prodromal AD than naming with unlimited time because of greater demand it places
on executive control. By examining the intersection of speech production and cognitive decline in bilinguals the
proposed studies will inform models of bilingualism and will shed unique light on the role of executive control in
supporting speech production more generally. The intersection between these fields of study may also lead to
improved methods for early identification of AD in a diverse demographic. Lastly, this research project will
enhance the applicant’s graduate school training and greatly increase her chances to have a productive career
as a bilingual speech-language pathologist with specialized training in research on aging and AD, and with a
focus on bilingualism which is often correlated with minority status in the USA."
10872290,"ABSTRACT: The goals of this K24 proposal are to train clinical investigators in the conduct of patient-oriented
cardiovascular disease (CVD) research primarily in Haiti, with a new project in Tanzania and to conduct a new
study on environmental lead exposure and CVD risk factors in Haiti (Aim 1). The training also leverages four
currently funded CVD research projects in Haiti (Aims 2-5), and a funded CVD research project in Tanzania
(Aim 6). United States trainees will spend ~50-60% of their time at international research sites in Haiti and
Tanzania, which have onsite Weill Cornell faculty, long-standing international collaborators, and outstanding
environments for research training. The common theme of the projects is patient-oriented CVD research in the
areas of clinical epidemiology, clinical trials, CVD-infectious diseases, and implementation science. The
projects include:
 1. Environmental lead exposure and CVD risk factors in Haiti
 2. Clinical epidemiology of CVD risk factors, diseases, and poverty-related social determinants in Haiti
 3. Randomized clinical trial of early hypertension treatment among persons living with HIV
 4. COVID-19 and cardiac dysfunction
 5. Implementation of hypertensive screening and management
 6. Heart failure in Tanzania
The focus of research training will be on postdoctoral clinical investigators who have completed their advanced
degree training. Dr. McNairy has an impeccable history of excellence in research mentorship and serves in
leadership roles in the Weill Cornell Global Health Research Fellowship and the Weill Cornell Women in Global
Health Research Initiative. Trainees will be mentored by Dr. McNairy and will participate in research projects in
Haiti (Aims 1-5) and Tanzania (Aim 6). These six projects have both clinical and laboratory aspects and offer
trainees a broad research experience. Trainees learn through the conduct of their mentored research project
and the opportunity to interact with colleagues working on studies other than their own. The K24 award will
allow Dr. McNairy to decrease her administrative and clinical responsibilities and commit 50% effort to CVD-
related research and mentorship of US trainees. Her long-term goal is to build a world-class CVD global health
research and training program to improve CVD-related health outcomes among the world's poorest
populations."
10872292,"Project Summary/Abstract
The advanced colon cancer with organ invasion and liver metastasis are the most common cause of colon cancer
death in part due to the resistance to current standard therapies. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop
small-molecule degraders of small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (SUMO1) as the first-in-class anticancer drugs for
treatment of advanced colon cancers. To achieve this goal, we have already identified SUMO1 as a cancer drug
target, developed cancer cell-based drug screen, identified the hit compound, and optimized the more potent
lead compounds through chemical modification of the hit compound. Investigating the drug-targeted pathway,
we have identified the compound binding cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated protein-1 (CAPRIN1)
and revealed the CAPRIN1-CUL1 ubiquitin ligase complex. Upon the binding of CAPRIN1, SUMO1 degraders
induce the recruitment of SUMO1 to CAPRIN1-CUL1 ligase for SUMO1 ubiquitination and degradation in cancer
cells. Using genetically characterized human colon cancer cell lines, 3-dimensional (3D) organoids and patient’s
derived xenografts (PDXs), we have provided the proof-of-principle that targeting SUMO1 by its degraders is a
safe and effective therapy for colon cancer. The objective of this project is to investigate the mechanism and
therapeutic efficacy of SUMO1 degraders in treatment of advanced colon cancer, alone and in combination of
the standard chemotherapy. To achieve this, we will first evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the lead compounds
in treatment of advanced colon cancer in Aim 1. To this end, we will test the in vivo toxicity, target engagement
biomarker and therapeutic efficacy of the lead compounds using genetically characterized advanced colon
cancer PDX models. Next, we will determine how SUMO1 degraders drive metabolic reprograming of glycolysis
and glutaminolysis in advanced colon cancer for the anticancer activity (Aim 2). We will reveal the mechanism
on how the degraders regulate the sumoylation of the transcription of the metabolic StAR-related lipid transfer
domain protein-7 (STARD7) in advanced colon cancer. Finally, we will determine the mechanism and therapeutic
efficacy of the combination of the lead compounds and standard chemotherapy in treatment of advanced colon
cancer in Aim 3. In particular, we will determine whether the metabolic enzyme G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase) is conjugated by SUMO1 and thus SUMO1 degraders eliminates its conjugation and functions
and sensitize colon cancers to the standard chemotherapy. Next, we will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the
combination of the degraders and chemotherapy in treatment of a large panel of genetically characterized 3D
organoid and PDX models. Upon completion, we expect that this preclinical project will provide solid scientific
foundation for development of SUMO1 degraders as the first-in-class anticancer drugs for treatment of advanced
colon cancer, a deadly human disease."
10864380,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Testosterone gender-affirming hormone therapy is associated with significant changes to the vaginal micro-
environment, such that most transgender men develop vaginal atrophy and have a non-Lactobacillus
dominated vaginal microbiota (i.e., vaginal dysbiosis). However, the association between vaginal atrophy, the
unique microbiota of the testosterone-exposed vagina, and vaginal infections is unknown. No interventions for
treating and preventing vaginal atrophy and vaginal dysbiosis have been evaluated for transgender men using
testosterone. There is an urgent need to better characterize the unique vaginal microbiota of transgender men
and assess the acceptability of potential interventions (such as intravaginal estrogen) to improve the sexual
health of this population. Thus, the overall objective of this project is to investigate the social, biological, and
epidemiological factors influencing vaginal dysbiosis in transgender men using testosterone. Our central
hypothesis is that the severity of vaginal atrophy mediates the impact of testosterone on the vaginal microbiota
and vaginal infections. In Aim 1, we will use a mixed-methods approach to identify and contextualize
transgender men’s gynecological treatment preference and key barriers/facilitators to accessing gynecological
care for vaginal infections, and to adapt existing scales for measuring vulvovaginal symptoms. In Aim 2, we will
recruit a cross-sectional clinical sample of transgender men to assess if testosterone use and vaginal atrophy
severity are associated with vaginal microbiota composition, taxonomic diversity, and/or vaginal infections. This
aim will use 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (V3-V4 hypervariable region) from self-collected vaginal
swabs. These aims constitute the mentored research component of the candidate’s career development plan
for this K01 submitted in response to NOT-MD-22-012. In parallel with this research, the candidate will pursue
training in translational microbiome science, supported by an exemplary team of renowned investigators with
expertise in the gynecological health of transgender men (Primary Mentor, Dr. Juno Obedin-Maliver), the
vaginal microbiome (Co-Mentors Drs. David Relman, Christina Muzny, and Christopher Taylor), and the impact
of hormones on genital tissues (Co-Mentor Dr. Bertha Chen). Stanford University offers a world class research
infrastructure that fosters outstanding collaborative and innovative translational research. This research also
leverages the expertise of Stanford’s LGBTQ+ Health Program and The PRIDE Study/ PRIDEnet, both of
which are national leaders in LGBTQ+ healthcare and research, as well as Dr. Tordoff and her mentor’s
significant experience conducting community-engaged research with transgender men. In summary, the strong
mentoring environment and training plan are anticipated to fully prepare Dr. Tordoff to launch an independent
research career. The proposed studies promise to address a critical gap in our understanding of the
gynecological health of transgender men using testosterone and support the development of culturally-tailored,
evidence-based interventions to prevent and treat vaginal atrophy, dysbiosis, and infections in this population."
10864483,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Proper formation of the head and face involves coordination of interactions among multiple tissues, including the
cranial nerves and mesenchyme, with aberrant interactions leading to cranio- and/or orofacial anomalies. These
abnormalities account for one-third of all birth defects, place a substantial financial burden on our healthcare
system, and are the primary cause of infant mortality. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of craniofacial
development that incorporates nerve-tissue interactions in a holistic approach is essential to overcome the
current challenges in treatment of diseases and disorders affecting the head and face. Many cranial nerves
transmit somatosensory information and possess neuronal cell bodies and glia within cranial ganglia, which arise
from the coalescence and differentiation of neural crest cells (NCCs) and placode cells (PCs). The appearance
of these ganglia, and the nerves to which they contribute, typically precedes that of their target tissues, strongly
implicating innervation in the context of target development. Notably, the trigeminal ganglion (TG) mediates the
majority of facial sensations due to its association with cranial nerve V, which is uniquely positioned in the head
to influence cranial cartilage and bone development due to the tissues through which it traverses. Prior studies,
including work by our lab, have shown the importance of NGF/TrkA signaling in TG axon outgrowth and target
tissue innervation. Intriguingly, this pathway has also been implicated in trunk long bone development,
maintenance, and repair, but this function for NGF/TrkA signaling has not been explored in the context of cranial
cartilage and bone development. Moreover, our new studies reveal remarkable deficits in cranial bone upon
perturbation of the PC component of the TG, a cell type that does not make this tissue, further underscoring the
importance of nerve-tissue interactions during development. However, the processes by which TG innervation
actively orchestrates target development and maintenance remain a significant gap in our knowledge of
craniofacial development. Herein, we will interrogate how unique nerve (TG)-target tissue (cranial mesenchyme)
interactions are required for the TG and its nerves to direct cranial cartilage and bone development through
pioneering studies in the chick embryo in the following Specific Aims: 1) determine the role of NGF/TrkA
signaling in embryonic cranial cartilage and bone development and 2) define how TG innervation directs target
tissues to form cartilage and bone. Our proposed research is innovative because it employs a systems-level,
multidisciplinary approach involving embryology, molecular cell biology, and transcriptomics, with the goal of
generating a new model to study nerve-target tissue interactions. These results will significantly advance our
knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underscoring TG nerve-tissue interactions directing formation of the
head, and, collectively, the etiology and therapeutic treatment of cranial nerve disorders and diseases arising
from aberrant NCC and PC development."
10867276,"From late March 2020, in response to COVID-19, Kenya began a lockdown including shuttering schools. On
16th October, rising seniors could return to school to prepare for exams. In western Kenya, where among girls
aged 15-19 HIV prevalence is 8.8% and HSV-2 prevalence is 28%, school closures likely have profound and
lasting effects on HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk. Within a cohort of 436 secondary school
girls, we are evaluating the effect of menstrual cups on the vaginal microbiome (VMB), Bacterial vaginosis
(BV), and STIs. On October 1, we initiated the 30-month visit, having followed up 371 (85%) girls by December
18. The prevalence of BV was 21.8%, and 15.6% for chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomonas, representing a
55% increase in BV since last measure at the 18-month visit (14%), and 34% increase in STI since last
measure at the 12-month evaluation (11.6%). Adjusted for socioeconomic factors, girls reporting high COVID-
related stress and interpersonal violence had increased odds of BV and STI. Adolescents are especially
sensitive to stress induced effects on the hypopituitary axis; increased stress and subsequent rise in cortisol
leads to reduced estrogen, which is necessary to support the Lactobacillus crispatus dominant environment
that helps prevent BV, STIs, and HIV. This study proposes to measure the socioeconomic, behavioral, and
psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 crisis, how this relates to girls’ sexual exposures, and subsequent risk of
BV, STI, and HIV. In Aim 1, we will quantify the economic, psychosocial, and behavioral impacts of COVID-19
and associated lockdowns and restrictions. Individual and village level assessments include changes in food
security, water access, household income, violence, crime, and safety. Individual measures include extensive
sexual practices, anxiety, depressive symptoms, interpersonal violence. In Aim 2, we will measure the
association of COVID-19 stressors on risk for HIV and STIs. We will be able to estimate the hazard of STI and
HIV outcomes under multiple conditions: pre-COVID (April 2018-October 2019), during COVID/school closures
(since March 2020), during COVID/school reopening (anticipated), post-COVID (anticipated). In Aim 3, we will
measure cortisol and estradiol and correlate this to reported stress, and quantify the influence of these
biological measures of stress on VMB composition and subsequent BV, STI, and HIV. To understand girls’ own
perceptions of and reasoning for behavioral and contextual changes, and to apply this to intervention
development, we will employ a series of semi-structured focus group discussions. Implications: This study will
provide detailed understanding of the financial, social, and behavioral impacts of COVID-19 and mitigation
efforts on adolescent girls in rural areas of Africa as exemplified by this area of western Kenya. We will be able
to examine this in relation to biological outcomes – VMB, BV, STI, HIV. The knowledge gained will directly
contribute to intervention development, and support future policy and guidelines on school closures and the
support adolescent girls need in the wake of similar future catastrophe."
10867278,"SUMMARY ABSTRACT: CRISPR-Modified Cardiac Xenograft Transplantation
 The past three years have witnessed two major breakthroughs in heart xenotransplantation. First, the
previously intractable barrier of delayed xenograft rejection (DXR) has been overcome in the pig-to-baboon
heart xeno model. In this model, DXR is manifest primarily as consumptive coagulopathy (CC) in the recipient
and thrombotic microangiopathy (TM) in the graft. Working in the heterotopic model in baboons, our
`Mohiuddin/NIH' group used genetically modified GTKO.hCPRP.hTBM hearts and a treatment regimen
including “induction” T and B depletion, MMF, and steroids – all clinically used drugs – with an experimental
monoclonal antibody directed against CD40. DXR was prevented for as long as CD40 treatment was
continued, and in one instance xenograft survival was extended beyond two years.
 The second major advance came from the Munich group, who reported consistent survival of orthotopic
pig heart xenograft recipients beyond 180 days using our immunomodulatory regimen and
GTKO.hCPRP.hTBM hearts. Accomplishing consistent survival of orthotopic heart xenografts had previously
been prevented by initial xenograft dysfunction (IXD), a phenomenon refractory to concerted efforts by multiple
experienced clinical transplant teams. Importantly, the Munich group found that minimizing graft ischemia was
necessary and sufficient to consistently prevent IXD. Discovering that ischemia minimization was sufficient to
overcome the IXD barrier is a `breakthrough' advance, even as the mechanism of improved graft protection by
ischemia minimization is not yet well understood.
 In this Project, we hypothesize that IXD mechanisms that injure GTKO.hCPRP.hTBM hearts may be
addressed by the additional xeno-focused genetic modifications expressed in one or more versions of Pig 2.0,
created by our collaborators at eGenesis using innovative CRISPR-driven gene editing tools. Pig 2.0 is
designed to address multiple known xeno-specific injury mechanisms through a combination of 12 xeno-
targeted genetic modifications. This Project takes advantage of availability of several well-defined versions of
Pig 2.0, our deep experience with multiple in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo heart xeno models, and a robust
mechanistic assay capability to determine whether Pig 2.0 is protected from heart IXD, with or without ischemia
minimization (Aim 1). Specifically, we will use these unique resources to learn a) whether versions of Pig 2.0
containing a coagulation cascade regulatory gene cassette are protected from IXD; b) whether ischemia
minimization is necessary and/or sufficient to prevent IXD in susceptible Pig 2.0 hearts; and c) to define a
clinically acceptable immunosuppression regimen for Pig 2.0 hearts in baboons that is consistently safe and
effective (Aim 2). Results from this Project will yield insights likely to catalyze progress for other cell and organ
xenografts, and inform clinical heart xenotransplantation trial design."

 Continuation of a T32 research training program is proposed, Interdisciplinary Research Training in
Otolaryngology and Communication Sciences, based in the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck
Surgery at the Medical University of South Carolina. Advancing the scientific foundation of otolaryngology and
communication health, improving health outcomes, and developing and testing new treatments requires well-
trained investigative teams with diverse skills and backgrounds in basic and clinical science. The training
program continues to address these needs by supporting research opportunities in the disciplines related to
otolaryngology and communication health, providing strong curricula in an integrative framework, with an
interdisciplinary research culture that emphasizes mentoring, academic advancement, career development,
grantsmanship, diversity outreach, responsible and ethical conduct of research, and productivity. The major
components of our multifaceted program are: (1) predoctoral research training leading to PhD degrees in
Biomedical Sciences or Health and Rehabilitation Science, with applications to otolaryngology/communication
health; (2) research training for medical students who take the “year-out” option to extend their education with
one year of research training; (3) short-term research training for health professional students with interests in
otolaryngology and communication disorders (including medical, dental, pharmacy, nursing, audiology,
speech-language pathology); and (4) postdoctoral research training for MD physician-scientists and PhD
scientists in basic, translational, and/or clinical sciences related to otolaryngology/communication health. Each
of these components is supported by highly collaborative mentors who direct active, funded research
programs; interdisciplinary research collaborations and specialized training in a broad spectrum of research
fields relevant to otolaryngology and communication health; and an exceptional institutional infrastructure and
research culture provided by multiple departments, colleges, and universities. Mentoring expertise,
technologies, and resources are thematically grouped in strategic areas of research focus: (1) basic and
clinical research in otolaryngology sciences and disorders, (2) basic and clinical research in communication
sciences and disorders, (3) basic and clinical neurosciences related to otolaryngology and communication
health, such as development, cognition, aging, and neurobiology, and (4) biostatistics and health services
research. Integrative activities include Otolaryngology and Communication Health Scholars Day, Seminars,
and Journal Clubs, and didactic courses designed for our trainees. A history and record of interdepartmental
collaborations and collegiality among researchers in disciplines related to otolaryngology and communication
health is a key factor that led to early and ongoing success for our training program as evidenced by
exceptional trainee accomplishments at all levels. Equally important is the long-standing culture of support,
value, and enthusiasm for research training by the leadership of participating departments and institutions."
10868554,"Abstract:
 Ischemic stroke affects a substantial number of people leading to long-term disability or death. Despite
the prevalence of stroke, few treatment options are available. During an ischemic stroke, blood flow to a region
of the brain is restricted preventing delivery of oxygen and essential nutrients. This leads to a complex
environment within and around the infarcted tissue. This includes rapid cell death, inflammation, and
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the surviving cells. The impact of ER stress on astrocytes and microglia
and the resulting functional outcomes are unknown. ER stress activates the serine/threonine kinase protein
kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) which phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) to attenuate
protein translation. Our previous work has shown that PERK also activates the tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 1
(JAK1) to drive inflammatory gene expression. Additionally, our preliminary data show that PERK-dependent
attenuation of protein translation enhances cytokine-induced inflammation in astrocytes and enhances neuronal
death. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that PERK and JAK1 signaling contribute to worse stroke
outcome and that targeting translational repression may provide therapeutic benefit. In this cycle, we will test
this directly by deleting PERK in astrocytes and microglia to examine how PERK contributes to outcome in the
stroke model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). We will examine how translational suppression and
JAK1 contribute to neuronal death and inflammation. Additionally, we will use the small molecule ISRIB to restore
protein translation following MCAO to examine effects on functional outcome. We anticipate that deletion of
PERK or restoration of protein translation will improve outcome following MCAO. Thus, identifying this signaling
axis as a potential therapeutic target and furthering our understanding of glial biology."
10865580,"ABSTRACT
Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Despite a substantial decrease
in cigarette smoking over the past decade, cigarette smoking accounts for nearly half a million deaths nationally,
more than alcohol and illicit drug use combined. People living with intellectual and developmental disabilities
(IDDs) are exceptionally vulnerable to dangers posed by cigarette smoking because it may worsen health
conditions common among people with IDDs, including diabetes and asthma. People living with IDDs are at an
increased risk of developing a tobacco use disorder (TUD), have a lower likelihood of entering treatment and
have a higher probability of dropping out of treatment. These issues highlight serious health equity concerns for
people with IDDs, including stigma, exclusion, underrepresentation, and lack of access to high quality care, and
may contribute to both the onset of cigarette smoking and serve as barriers to tobacco treatment enrollment,
thus making people with IDDs vulnerable to persistent TUD and tobacco-related disease. The goal of this
K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award is to use a community engaged approach to elucidate treatment
difficulties in IDD populations and use the information gained from the community to adapt and test an evidence-
based smoking cessation intervention. Achieving this goal is a crucial step in a larger process of establishing an
essential line of research treating TUDs with people with IDDs. Through this K99 we aim to complete 40 semi-
structed interviews with staff and patients actively engaged and not engaged in tobacco treatment to 1) identify
barriers that contribute to low TUD treatment enrollment and high drop-out rates for people with IDDs, and 2)
select and adapt an existing intervention for use with those with IDDs. Through the R00 we will utilize the results
of our K99 to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of a tailored, behavioral smoking cessation
intervention in this population. The modified intervention, based on findings from the K99, will be implemented
in a feasibility trial in people with IDDs. Outcomes will include intervention feasibility and acceptability (primary
outcome), self-reported cigarette smoking (secondary outcome) and cigarette smoking measured by expired
breath carbon monoxide (secondary outcome). The results of this project will inform the development and
implementation of a larger randomized controlled trial to be conducted as part of a future R01 grant. This project
will fill a profound research gap by understanding significant smoking treatment barriers and developing and
piloting a tailored smoking cessation intervention for people with IDDs. This award will include substantial training
and mentorship from a diverse group of K99 mentors who will supplement Dr. Regnier’s experience in the
application of evidence-based treatments to IDD populations, and provide him with skills in implementation
science, clinical trial research, community engagement and professional development that will help him obtain
his goal of becoming a leader in addiction research in people with IDDs."
10865941,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Rationale: Despite novel chemotherapies have significantly improved the prognosis of melanoma patients, drug
resistance occurs inevitably and tumor progression becomes inexorable, presenting an unmet and urgent need for
novel therapeutic intervention. Most melanomas harbor oncogenic BRAFV600E and are responsive to the
BRAFV600E-specific inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib; however, patients eventually acquire
resistance mainly due to MAPK reactivation and/or the counteraction by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). While
substantial efforts have been made to mitigate therapy resistance using PI3K inhibitors; there has been a lack
of success as no PI3K inhibitors are currently capable of serving for this purpose. PI3K has four functionally
divergent catalytic kinases PI3Kα/β/δ/γ. Drugs that block all four kinases or individual PI3Kα/δ/γ have shown clinical
benefit, but elicited notable metabolic or immune-related toxicities. Such clinical challenge in drugging PI3Kα/δ/γ has
fueled interest in PI3Kβ therapies; however, PI3Kβ ATP competitive inhibitors GSK2636771, TGX-221, and AZD6482
are not clinically effective, notwithstanding their promising preclinical anti-cancer activities. This is perhaps because
ATP competitive inhibitors interact with well-conserved residues at motifs pivotal for executing kinase activity in
PI3Kα/β/δ/γ, making them not as PI3Kβ-selective as desired. Rising to this challenge, we have recently identified an
18-residue motif dubbed β18 that occurs only in PI3Kβ, but not in PI3Kα/δ/γ. Selectide-18 bearing β18 and a cell-
penetrating peptide distorts PI3Kβ complexes, inactivates PI3Kβ, slows down the growth of BRAFV600E melanomas
expressing high levels of PI3Kβ and low levels of the PI3K-antagonizing phosphatase PTEN (designated as
PI3Kβhyper), and sensitizes therapy-resistant PI3Kβhyper melanoma cells to dabrafenib/trametinib. Our further in-silico
analyses have identified Selectide-9, a short version of Selectide-18 which only contains 9 residues derived from the
S18 motif, but still retains the same cytotoxic activities as Selectide-18. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that Selectide-
9 selectively degrades and inactivates PI3Kβ, thereby overcoming therapy resistance in PI3Kβhyper melanoma.
Specific Aims: We will use approaches established in the PI’s laboratory to test the above hypothesis. In Aim 1, we
will test how Selectide-9 degrades and inactivates PI3Kβ selectively using biochemical and imaging techniques. In
Aim 2, we will test whether Selectide-9 is superior to ATP competitive inhibitors in overcoming therapy resistance
using two human BRAFV600E patient-derived xenograft lines in immunodeficient mice. The WM4701-6673 line has
low levels of PI3Kβ and the recurrent/therapy-resistant WM4701-7329 tumor is derived from WM4701-6673 treated
with a BRAFV600E inhibitor. We will determine if WM4701-6673 is sensitive, whilst WM4701-7329 is resistant, to
dabrafenib and trametinib and if Selectide-9 is more potent than GSK2636771 in restoring the sensitivity to dabrafenib
and trametinib. Moreover, we will identify gene signatures defining therapy-resistant PI3Kβhyper melanomas using
single-cell RNA sequencing. Impact: Our work will lay the groundwork to support future studies to gain deeper
insights into therapy resistance in melanoma and identify an innovative approach to circumventing this resistance."

As the most common neurodegenerative disease of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) causes progressive
memory loss and cognitive impairment. AD has neither a clear pathogenesis nor effective treatments. Its
progression is marked by loss of neurons at the time of diagnosis. The proximal causes of this loss are not well
understood. Nevertheless, neuronal loss follows loss of synapses, and earlier loss of synaptic function is a
leading aspect of the disease. My goals are to gain expertise in modern principles and understanding of AD and
animal models of AD from lectures, from access to our graduate training program in AD research and from my
highly skilled mentoring team. I will use those skills to aid my research into the role of the synapse in AD.
 Based on preliminary data that loss of synaptic function in humanized APOE4 mouse models at excitatory
synapses in the hippocampus, I propose that a critical factor in synaptic transmission is presynaptic Ca2+
signaling and homeostasis. Amongst, the first brain regions to be affected in AD patients is the hippocampus, a
critical brain area for cognition and memory and we and others have observed APOE subtype dependent
changes in evoked plasticity in hippocampal synaptic transmission. I propose to use high spatiotemporal
resolution approaches to imaging synaptic transmission and presynaptic signal transduction. However, dynamic
imaging of these events means that continuous irradiation causes photodamage and phototoxicity.
 For my research program and to overcome this problem, I have used my physics background to build a light
sheet instrument, called lattice light-sheet (LLS) using the approach developed by Eric Betzig 1, that uses a
linearly polarized sheet of light with a binary phase map of Bessel beams to form optical lattices which markedly
increases the axial resolution to ~400 nm. It allows extremely fast image acquisition (up to 1 KHz frame rates)
and minimal phototoxicity. Using the LLS microscope, I can resolve fast components of synaptic transmission,
including neurotransmitter release. I have also developed a novel approach for LLS imaging of incoherent
holography to scan the sample volume without moving the detection objective. This enables an increase in axial
resolution and allows me to visualize intact neural tissue, with access to quantitative information of samples
being imaged. Using the training possible through this K25 program I will now interrogate synaptic dysfunction
in presynaptic terminals for its role in neurogenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer disease.
 I will combine my imaging expertise and resources that I have built in the Alford laboratory with the expertise
and availability of mouse models of neurodegeneration available from my mentors, Drs Tai and Lazarov along
with circuit expertise in the Tseng laboratory to understand loss of synaptic function associated with
neurodegenerative disease. This provides the foundation for my training, adding to my expertise as an
accomplished physicist and imaging specialist who wishes to apply these skills to understanding the aging brain."

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) prevalence is socially patterned and geographically clustered. Emerging
studies have suggested that various neighborhood characteristics, such as social disadvantage, food
environments, and walkability, contribute CKD incidence and progression as well as its disparities. However,
existing research has several limitations, including systematic misclassification of neighborhood exposures,
inadequate assessment of secular changes in neighborhood factors, and lacking careful considerations of co-
occurring neighborhood conditions as confounders or effect modifiers. Moreover, no study has examined the
causal effects of neighborhood changes, although identifying specific neighborhood characteristics, particularly
built environments, as modifiable factors to address CKD burden is a promising avenue for health equity work.
The goal of this K01 award is to address gaps in the literature while also supporting the candidate’s goal of
transitioning to an independent scholar focused on identifying and addressing upstream neighborhood
determinants of CKD. Through formal coursework, workshops, mentored research, and attendance at scientific
conferences, Dr. Kim will gain expertise in the social and spatial epidemiology of CKD outcomes, and will
pursue methodological training in quasi-experimental study design, EHR-based analyses, and rigorous
ascertainments of outcomes using computable phenotyping. Building on Dr. Kim’s prior training as a
social/spatial epidemiologist, these complementary training and research aims will allow Dr. Kim to elucidate
nuanced causal mechanism of neighborhood effects on CKD and will provide him with a combination of
methodological tools that can be flexibly applied to future research questions at the nexus of CKD
epidemiology and health disparities.
The proposed research will leverage EHR data from a national cohort of U.S. veterans to examine associations
between various sets of neighborhood characteristics and CKD outcomes within a novel quasi-experimental
framework, exploiting individual-level changes in neighborhood characteristics based on residential mobility.
The proposed aims 1) quantify the individual and joint impacts of neighborhood characteristics on CKD
incidence/progression, 2) examine potential causal pathways between neighborhood characteristics and CKD
via its clinical causes, and 3) conduct a quasi-experimental study of the causal impacts of changing built
environments on CKD incidence/progression. This work is in line with NIDDK’s strategic goals to elucidate
drivers of population disparities in CKD and to leverage natural experiment conditions. By providing salary
support, training, and a formal mentorship structure, this award will facilitate Dr. Kim’s transition to an
independent career focused on the study of spatial epidemiology of CKD."
10866260,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Protein, especially albumin, in the urine after acute kidney injury (AKI) signals nephron damage and can
identify patients at high risk of subsequent renal function loss, as well as increased morbidity and mortality.
However, only 1 in 10 patients has a proteinuria measurement within 3 months of hospital discharge. Healthy
People 2030 aims to promote early follow up care after AKI and increase proteinuria testing. Understanding the
facilitators and barriers to testing, improving AKI awareness, and integrating innovative platforms to treat
proteinuria may prevent long-term adverse outcomes associated with AKI.
Dr. Y. Diana Kwong, a nephrologist at UCSF, is a young investigator who is committed to directly improving
patient outcomes in those with kidney disease, especially AKI. Her prior research has focused on biomarkers
in kidney disease, as well as patient reported outcomes and recovery after AKI. This K23 proposal provides
her training in qualitative methods for implementation science, longitudinal cohort analysis using the electronic
health record, and clinical trials. The proposed plan will allow for the exploration, development, and piloting of
strategies to increase rates of proteinuria testing and management after AKI and prepare her for a career as an
independent clinical investigator.
Dr. Kwong has assembled an internationally renowned team of mentors composed of: Dr. Kathleen Liu, an
experienced critical care nephrologist and clinical trialist; Dr. Chi-yuan Hsu, a leading expert in AKI and CKD
epidemiology and outcome studies; Dr. Kimberly Koester, an academic cultural anthropologist specializing in
mixed methods and implementation science; and Dr. David Glidden, a biostatistician with extensive experience
in kidney disease. She will utilize UCSF’s robust clinical and research resources for her studies and will be
supported by the Department of Medicine’s Data Core in acquiring data from the electronic health record to
identify patients with AKI retrospectively and prospectively.
Under the guidance of her mentorship team, Dr. Kwong will conduct the following aims. Aim 1 will use semi-
structured interviews of providers and patients to understand facilitators and barriers of proteinuria testing. Aim
2A will retrospectively evaluate the association of physician awareness of AKI with proteinuria testing rates
while Aim 2B will prospectively evaluate the association of patient awareness of AKI with proteinuria testing
rates. Aim 3 will pilot an intervention to manage proteinuria compared to usual care at 3 months after an AKI-
related hospital discharge.
Ultimately, this K23 will prepare Dr. Kwong for a successful career as clinical researcher focused on improving
AKI outcomes. This career development award will naturally lead to an NIDDK R01 application for a larger trial
on proteinuria management in patients after AKI. Increased identification and management of patients with
proteinuria after AKI may reduce long-term adverse outcomes and improve the survival of AKI patients."
10866262,"Background: Anxiety and depression disorders can be very debilitating and result in substantial disability.
These disorders are extremely common, occurring at rates that exceed other common medical illnesses such
as hypertension, diabetes or asthma. Further, anxiety and depression disorders often co-occur (more the rule
than the exception) and having one diagnosis substantially increases the risk for having the other. The clinical
benefits of an intervention that ameliorates both anxiety and depression-related disability and clinical
symptoms could be critically important, as odds of Veteran suicide completion significantly increase when
depression co-occurs with anxiety disorders. Extensive preclinical and clinical data (from our group and others)
support a novel neurosteroid intervention (pregnenolone/PREG) as a promising new treatment for anxiety and
depression disorders. Furthermore, extensive evidence in rodent models and clinical biomarker candidate
studies suggests substantial analgesic, anxiolytic, sleep and anti-inflammatory actions. PREG also significantly
reduced low back pain in a randomized controlled trial of 94 OEF/OIF/OND-era Veterans compared to placebo,
and allopregnanolone (ALLO) levels are inversely correlated with several commonly co-occurring symptoms,
including sleep disturbance and pain disorders. Restoration of ALLO levels via a precursor loading strategy
with PREG could thus ameliorate ALLO deficits and alleviate multiple functionally impairing and health-related
symptoms. Additionally, PREG has been very well-tolerated in multiple clinical trials and exhibits a very
favorable side effect profile – potentially supporting a superior safety and side effect profile advantage
compared to existing pharmacological interventions. We thus propose to conduct a 10-week double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled trial of PREG versus placebo in Veterans with anxiety and depression.
Methods: The primary goal of this proposed project is to conduct a 10-week adaptive, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate flexibly dosed pregnenolone [to improve functional impairment and
disability associated with anxiety and depression. Following a 2-week placebo-only lead-in period, 84 subjects
will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive PREG or placebo for 8 weeks (flexible dosing strategy). We
hypothesize that treatment with PREG will significantly reduce functional impairment and disability associated
with anxiety and depression symptoms. Secondary outcomes include diagnostic improvements in anxiety and
depression, pain symptoms and sleep quality. We hypothesize that PREG will improve symptoms of anxiety
and depression, pain and sleep quality. Finally, we will quantify serum neurosteroid levels at baseline and post-
treatment by highly sensitive and specific mass spectrometry-based techniques to determine if PREG and
downstream neurosteroid metabolites such as ALLO are predictors of functional/therapeutic response. We will
also examine proinflammatory markers. We hypothesize that changes in PREG and other neurosteroids (as
well as proinflammatory markers) will predict improvements in mental health and functional outcomes.]
Conclusion: Results from the proposed trial could provide rigorous scientific rationale for future pivotal Phase
3 trials to test PREG for the treatment of anxiety and depression disorders (improving functional outcomes and
mitigation of pain and sleep disturbance). PREG has been very well-tolerated in multiple Veteran cohorts and
could thus be a safe, inexpensive and efficacious new intervention to improve function and multiple behavioral
symptoms."

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (NHL/CLL) patients have immune system deficits
that arise from the cancer and are aggravated by lymphoma therapies, placing them at higher risk of morbidity
and mortality after infection with viruses like influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). Patients are strongly recommended to get vaccinated and boosted with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA
vaccines, but antibody responses after vaccination in these patients are often impaired. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines
also elicit T cell responses in healthy individuals that may be protective but previous studies indicate that T cells
from NHL/CLL patients are also dysfunctional.
Under the mentorship of Drs. Rafi Ahmed and Jonathon Cohen, I have assembled a cohort of over 600 NHL/CLL
patients with over 1,300 longitudinal blood samples paired with clinical data that I have used to study the immune
responses in this patient population. Using this cohort, I showed that most patients have lower antibody
responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination than otherwise healthy individuals and that antibody responses
correlate at least partly with lymphoma therapies. I have also shown that some patients produce spike-specific
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after vaccination. The longitudinal, antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses
after vaccination and infection have not been well characterized in NHL/CLL patients. I hypothesize that these
patients have alterations in their CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses after antigen stimulation, which are dependent
on the underlying lymphoma subtype and lymphoma therapy.
This proposal has 3 goals: 1) To evaluate the generation, differentiation, breadth, and persistence of SARS-
CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell responses in NHL/CLL patients after vaccination and infection using functional
assays and single cell sequencing technologies; 2) To define the primary and memory SARS-CoV-2-specific
CD8+ T cell responses after vaccination and infection through functional assays and single cell sequencing
technologies; and 3) to support my transition from a trainee in Dr. Ahmed’s laboratory to leading an independent
research program.
Successful completion of these studies will provide in-depth knowledge of the generation, evolution, breadth,
and persistence of antigen-specific T cell responses in NHL/CLL patients after vaccination and infection. This
knowledge will facilitate the design of interventions that may improve vaccine responses in these and other
immunosuppressed patients, protecting them from potentially life-threatening viral infections like SARS-CoV-2
and influenza. Moreover, the insights on the generation and maintenance of adaptive immune responses against
novel antigens obtained from these studies could help fuel the development of better cancer immunotherapies."

The first two cycles of our R01 entitled, “Understanding the role of TDP-43 in Alzheimer's disease and FTLD”
were very successful with over 50 peer-reviewed publications and many novel discoveries. In the 2nd cycle we
focused mainly on how TDP-43, tau and beta-amyloid contributed to neurodegeneration in those with
Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC). Our studies were conducted on a cohort of 756 ADNC
cases. We discovered that TDP-43 deposition in ADNC was heterogeneous and for the first time showed that
there are two distinct types of TDP-43 deposition in ADNC that we termed TDP type-α and type-β. What is
most interesting about this discovery is that TDP type-α have strikingly similar features to one pathological type
of FTLD-TDP (FTLD-TDP type A) while TDP type-β is strongly associated with the presence of neurofibrillary
tangles, and hence tau. A second discovery was that different inclusions associated with the different
pathological types of FTLD-TDP (type A, type B and type C) had different molecular compositions of TDP-43
specie. For example, while most inclusions consisted of C-terminal fragments of TDP-43, pre-inclusions and
perivascular inclusions consisted of a greater burden of full-length TDP-43 than C-terminal fragments.
Therefore, one of the main goals of the 3rd cycle is to further assess how ADNC TDP types (type-α and type-β)
are related to FTLD-TDP types (type-A, type-B, type-C) by investigating associations with the different
molecular specie of TDP-43 including C-terminal fragments, full-length and phosphorylated TDP-43. A second
goal of the R01 is to further our findings from the 2nd cycle in order to better understand how TDP types (type-α
and type-β) modifies the associations between TDP-43 and neurodegeneration. We will investigate,
specifically, how TDP, including TDP types, tau and beta-amyloid and other pathological and genetic factors
are associated with trajectories of volume loss of hippocampus and neocortex over time. Our cohort will consist
of cases with multiple head MRI scans (range: 2-13 yearly MRI scans; total scans=2316) prior to death. Last,
but not least, we will address one of the biggest knowledge gaps in the field, the lack of a biomarker that can
help predict the presence of TDP-43 in ADNC during life. We will use [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET, which we
have shown is superior to MRI, to predict TDP-43. We will first develop the biomarker and then test it in an
independent cohort. In order to accomplish all the aims of the 3rd cycle we will upgrade our cohort size to 1303
pathologically confirmed cases of ADNC and FTLD. Findings from this 3rd cycle will significantly improve
understanding of TDP-43, and TDP-43 types, and help to address the nagging issue of where the boundary
lies between TDP-43 in ADNC and FTLD-TDP. Given that TDP-43 is a potential therapeutic target for the
treatment of FTLD and now Alzheimer's disease, the 3rd cycle will likely also have a significant impact on the
field."

Hyperlipidemia (HLD) is a major contributor to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading
cause of US mortality and morbidity. Nearly 30% of Emergency Department (ED) patients with chest pain have
undiagnosed and/or unmanaged HLD, putting them at an increased risk of ASCVD. Although safe and
effective HLD treatments exist, the ED traditionally focuses on acute care and does not offer preventive
cardiovascular care services or treatment for HLD. This represents a large, missed opportunity to improve
cardiovascular health for the millions of Americans evaluated in the ED each year for chest pain who are not
receiving appropriate guideline-directed preventive care in the outpatient setting. The overarching research
goals of this study are to determine the efficacy of a novel, protocolized, ED-based preventive care
intervention for HLD known as EMERALD (Emergency Medicine Cardiovascular Risk Assessment for Lipid
Disorders) in lowering cholesterol while also informing our understanding of patient adherence and
implementation determinants of ED-based preventive cardiovascular care. To accomplish these goals, I
worked with my mentoring team to design a career development plan that blends multidisciplinary research
training with an innovative research proposal. Aim 1 will use a randomized, controlled, single center, parallel
group trial of 130 ED patients to test the efficacy of EMERALD vs. usual care in lowering cholesterol. Aim 2 will
rely on mixed methods to identify patient adherence facilitators and barriers as well as implementation
determinants for Emergency Medicine providers. To successfully accomplish these Specific Aims, I will
capitalize on the outstanding research environment at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine and my
engaged transdisciplinary mentorship team of senior scientists. With support from my mentoring team, I will
complete a robust career development program that will provide me with the necessary training in preventive
cardiovascular care, clinical trial design and methodology, and qualitative methods that are needed for me to
become an independent investigator and national leader with expertise in ED-based preventive cardiovascular
care strategies. The proposed K23 Award aligns with NHLBI's objective to “Develop and optimize novel
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to prevent, treat, and cure heart, lung, blood, and sleep diseases,” with
position statements from Emergency Medicine and Cardiology professional societies, and with the Department
of Health and Human Services “Healthy People 2030” initiative. This proposal will inform our understanding of
ED-based preventive cardiovascular care strategies and will help me achieve my long-term goal of becoming
an independent investigator focused on ED-based preventive cardiovascular care."

Over 297,790 new cases of invasive breast cancer diagnoses and 43,170 deaths from metastatic breast cancer
(mBC) are expected in the USA this year (SEER database). Despite advances in the treatment of localized
disease, the 5-year overall survival of patients with mBC remains at a dismal 29%. Current therapeutic strategies
primarily focus on tumor cells and neglect the important role the tumor stroma plays in cancer progression.
Underscoring the importance of the stromal compartment, stromal gene signatures can predict clinical outcomes
for breast cancer patients7. The most common site of breast cancer metastasis is the bone and unfortunately,
once the disease metastasizes to the bone, it is considered incurable and treatment is mainly palliative8. In the
bone, the tumor stroma consists of a wide array of cell types including fibroblasts, adipocytes, nerve cells,
endothelial cells, immune cells, chondrocytes, osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts. Nearly all of these
stromal cell types has been implicated in tumor progression by directly supporting tumor cell growth, survival,
modulating the immune response to tumors, and/or driving bone loss that ignites a vicious cycle that supports
further tumor growth in the bone8. One important stromal cell that supports primary tumor progression is the
senescent cell, which was recently described as an emerging cancer hallmark9. Indeed, we demonstrated that
senescent fibroblasts drive tumor growth10 and create immunosuppressive environments11 in the primary tumor
setting through expression of p38MAPKα-dependent senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
factors. Whether the same mechanisms are active in the metastatic setting remains an open question. We have
found that p38MAPKα inhibition (p38i) reduces mBC progression by targeting the metastatic stromal
compartment, but not tumor cells, in numerous preclinical models. In this proposal, we will examine how
p38MAPKα activation in the metastatic stroma contributes to tumor progression and modifies the immune
response to allow mBC to progress. We will utilize genetic and pharmacologic tools to identify the cell targets of
p38i, determine if a new stromal cell that we have identified, the senescent metastatic-associated cancer
associated fibroblast (smeCAF) contributes to cancer-induced bone loss, and determine if smeCAFs modify the
host immune response within the bone. Our goal is to understand how p38i alters the stromal compartment to
decrease mBC progression so that this knowledge can be leveraged to develop combinatorial strategies to
deploy p38i, senolytics (drugs that kill senescent cells), and immunotherapy to limit mBC progression."
10878278,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 More than half of human spinal cord injury (SCI) cases occur at the cervical level, resulting in permanent
respiratory deficits for which there is no treatment. Injury-induced axon growth of spared respiratory pathways is
a form of endogenous neural plasticity that can be harnessed to improve breathing. However, experimental
strategies to promote respiratory axon growth are lacking, and the few existing approaches have translational
limitations. Without expanding the repertoire of molecular and/or cellular interventions to enhance axonal
plasticity of the respiratory network following injury, developing treatment to restore breathing will be unlikely.
The objectives of this proposal are: first, to determine if endogenous astrocytes can be reprogrammed to
enhance structural plasticity of the respiratory system to improve breathing after SCI; and second, based on
evidence that coupling axon growth-promoting strategy with rehabilitative training can further augment functional
recovery, assess combinatorial effects of astrocyte reprogramming and respiratory training on recovery of
breathing after SCI. The central hypothesis is that post-injury targeting of astrocytes, combined with respiratory
training, will synergistically improve breathing after SCI. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two aims: 1)
determine the effects of pre-injury astrocyte manipulation alone, or in combination with respiratory training, on
structural and functional plasticity of the respiratory system; and 2) assess post-injury and location-specific
effects of astrocyte manipulation alone, or in combination with respiratory training, on respiratory plasticity. The
rationale for this proposal is that it will inform on the therapeutic potential of reprogramming endogenous
astrocytes to promote axonal plasticity of the respiratory system, which may be further harnessed by
rehabilitative training to maximize recovery of breathing after SCI."

Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare inherited bone marrow failure disorder caused mainly by heterozygous
loss-of-function mutations in 20 out of 83 ribosomal protein (RP) genes, the most commonly affected one being
RPS19. DBA usually presents with erythroid production failure during infancy, although clinical observations
suggest impaired hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function in some older DBA patients. Characterization of this
suspected HSC defect is limited by difficulties in obtaining DBA patient CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells (HSPCs) and the lack of ideal human cellular experimental models. I have used Cas9 to create RPS19
haploinsufficiency in healthy donor CD34+ HSPCs. My preliminary data show that RPS19+/- HSPCs exhibit
impaired erythropoiesis and normal myelopoiesis in vitro and impaired bone marrow repopulation ability following
xenotransplantation into immunodeficient mice, suggesting an HSC defect. Co-disruption of TP53 completely
rescues the erythroid defect and partly alleviates the HSC defect. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis shows
increased expression of PRC2 target genes in RPS19+/- HSPCs. This indicates reduced PRC2 activity, which
epigenetically represses a gene program that is essential for HSC maintenance. Accordingly, my K99/R00
proposal investigates the hypothesis that RPS19 haploinsufficiency impairs HSPCs by inducing TP53 activity
and reducing PRC2 activity. I will test this hypothesis by defining the effect of RPS19 haploinsufficiency on the
lineage developmental potential of defined HSPC subpopulations (Aim 1) and describing the molecular
mechanisms underlying activation of TP53 and reduction of PRC2 activities in RPS19+/- HSPCs (Aim 2). Lastly,
I will utilize cutting-edge approaches, including single-cell studies, to describe alterations in transcriptome and
translatome networks in RPS19+/- HSPCs (Aim 3). These investigations will elucidate a poorly understood aspect
of DBA pathophysiology and provide new insights into the biology of HSCs. I will carry out the K99 phase of
these aims in an exceptional research environment under the guidance of a senior mentorship team and a formal
plan to receive training in advanced laboratory methods and various aspects of career development. My
research, training plans and transition to independence achieved under the auspices of the K99/R00 mechanism
will support my long-term goal of becoming an independent, NIH R01-funded physician-scientist with expertise
in ribosomal biology, human hematopoiesis, bone marrow failure syndromes, bone marrow transplantation and
gene therapy."
10889101,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Many diseases of aging, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD related dementia, have been linked
with significant metabolic changes that are regulated by diverse molecular classes. Nodes of the aging- and
AD-associated metabolic signature include: (i) General proteomic profile as reflecting changes in protein
homeostasis and/or an ongoing neurodegenerative event; (ii) Glycosylation of glycoproteins, as reflecting
changes in engagement and trafficking along the secretory pathway, as well as “post-delivery” processing cell-
surface glycoproteins; and (iii) Biological membrane lipid composition and general bioactive lipid metabolism.
 Several studies have shown changes in brain metabolism are not uniform throughout AD progression, with
parietal, posterior temporal, and anterior occipital lobes most severely affected. Because of this, broad
conclusions about the AD brain following analysis that does not include spatial information may be painting an
incomplete picture of AD pathogenesis. Due to the complexity of the brain, spatial distribution as well as
functional integrations of the above nodes are warranted to understand both aging of the brain and AD
pathophysiology. To perform a more comprehensive analysis of region-specific molecular pattern changes in
the AD brain, we propose to employ matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometric imaging
(MALDI MSI) technology to examine spatial distribution changes of several molecular classes in animal models
of AD as well as postmortem brain tissue of late-onset AD (LOAD) patients.
 The GENERAL HYPOTHESIS of this research is that alteration in the molecular pattern of various
biologically relevant molecular classes can reflect or influence the onset and progression of AD. Aim 1 will
map region-specific glycan and glycoprotein expression pattern changes in the whole brain tissue sections of
AD mouse models and LOAD patient tissue samples. We will create an atlas of the glycoproteome and
illuminating changes in glycosylation that could be key in understanding AD pathogenesis. Aim 2 will map
lipidome and unsaturated lipid isomers and changes in metabolic signature in the whole brain tissue sections
of AD mouse models and LOAD patient tissue samples. The use of innovative double-bond localization
chemistry will expand our current understanding of the AD lipidome, revealing a molecular map of not just lipid
classes, but specific lipid isomers within the AD brain. Aim 3 will develop technology- and computationally-
driven approaches for biomolecule validation, co-localization, and multidimensional correlation. Our proposed
machine learning algorithms will enable simultaneous and region-specific correlation of multiple classes of
molecules. Our collaborative team’s orthogonal research foci and interdisciplinary expertise will enable us to
generate novel mechanistic and translational data that will inform the research community on the progression
of aging and AD. The mechanistic component has the potential to yield significant knowledge that can be used
to target specific biomolecules and expand our research beyond this RFA."
10889142,"Surgical treatments for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) suffer from high complication and reoperation rates, with
70% of native tissue repair operations failing within five years and the FDA halting commercial use of
graft materials for transvaginal procedures. Many of these problematic grafts are repurposed from non-
gynecologic procedures and cannot mimic the properties of the vagina. Recent cell- or protein-enhanced
experimental grafts also do not bridge the technological gap due to mechanical failure and immunogenic DNA
retention. Given the gap in knowledge regarding engineering POP repair grafts less susceptible to failure, our
objective is to obtain novel data on healthy, non-prolapsed vaginal extracellular matrix (vECM) structure and
function to inform devel-opment of a synthetic biomimetic graft. We will define contributions of collagen and
elastin fibers to the mechan-ical behavior of vaginal tissue and use these data as constraints for iterative design
of elastomeric, biocompatible graft components that provide mechanical support and cell adhesion. Then, we
will probe for fibroblast adhesion and absence of pathologic myofibroblast differentiation on these materials.
Our proposed product design is com-posed of a non-degradable 3D printed elastomer mesh encapsulated by a
3D printed hydrogel coating that can be remodeled by surrounding cells. The goal of this proposal is to test
our hypothesis that mechanical and biochemical cues provided by vECM drive cellular organization and
structure of the healthy vagina and can be replicated in a mechanically competent biomimetic POP repair
graft. This hypothesis will be tested via experi-mental techniques in biomechanics, imaging, additive
manufacturing, and bioreactor cell culture. Aim 1 will fur-ther define the relationship between vaginal elasticity
and vECM proteins and produce an elastomeric mesh that minimizes pathologic myofibroblast transformation
by mimicry of vECM fiber mechanics. This aim will be achieved through vECM elasticity profiling, 3D
printing of biocompatible elastomers to form a mesh with similar mechanical properties, and assessment of
cellular response to this mesh in a tension bioreactor. Aim 2 will define tissue-specific cell adhesion
dynamics and produce a composite 3D printed material capable of partial degradation embedded with
physiologic distributions of key extracellular matrix proteins to promote cell adhe-sion. This aim will be
achieved via microscopy and proteomic analysis of vECM, 3D printing of a partially de-gradable coating
mimicking vECM microstructure and protein distribution, and assessment of cellular adhesion to this coating
in a tension bioreactor. The work detailed through this proposal will answer critical questions regarding the
structure-function properties of vECM and produce two novel materials with therapeutic potential for POP
repair when used together or separately as potential enhancements to commercially available materials. This
research is inspired by my own interests in pathology, surgical outcomes, and host response to engineered
biomaterials. Completing this proposal will provide me with intellectual and technical skills that are essential for
my future work as a physician-scientist at the intersection of biomaterials, pathology, and reconstructive
surgery."

 Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of over 5000 man-made chemicals that are
ubiquitous in the environment, due to their chemical stability and bioaccumulative properties. Many of these
“forever chemicals” have been linked with health concerns, including strong evidence of developmental health
and harm to hormone-sensitive tissues. Manufacturers continue to substitute new PFAS for which exposure-
based health risks are unknown. There is an urgent public health need to determine the effects of PFAS in use
on both mammary gland development and increased breast cancer incidence. Current exposure studies use
rodent models that require cumbersome end-point analyses as well as large monetary and time investments.
 Our proposal is aimed at developing an in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) pipeline of mammary gland
development and maintenance to identify and prioritize potentially toxic PFAS, to ultimately mitigate number of
animals needed for environmental exposure studies. Our approach is to develop in vitro models of the mammary
gland of increasing complexity but decreasing throughput, identifying links between high-throughput and high-
complexity model endpoint readouts to best prioritize large chemical libraries. A key technology to establish links
across multiple in vitro culture platforms is optical coherence tomography-based structural-functional imaging
(OCT-SFI), developed by MPI Oldenburg, which non-invasively visualizes label-free cells, their intracellular
motility, and morphology of formed spheroids, within optically turbid tissue models.
 Our first specific aim advances a high-throughput paper-based culture system, developed by MPI Lockett, to
study mammary epithelial cell invasion in physiologically relevant tissue microenvironments. The platform will
evaluate 96 different exposure conditions in parallel. Our second specific aim employs 3D co-culture models that
include fibroblasts to model stromal signaling known to affect mammary gland development. OCT-SFI will
provide cellular motility and morphology of the organotypic spheroids that form in these cultures. Finally, our third
aim will screen a library of 40 PFAS, with a particular focus on the perfluoroethercarboxylic acids (PFECAs)
currently used in industrial coatings. In addition, 12 PFAS will be screened for which there is existing in vivo
rodent model data available, and comparisons between in vitro assay outputs and in vivo gland remodeling will
be used to refine the assay models and establish initial thresholds for screening.
 The models developed as part of this proposal will thus be predictive of biology, enabling the high-throughput
capability needed for future screening of all PFAS as well as other emerging endocrine disruptors. The project’s
risk is balanced by the known imaging capabilities of OCT-SFI to probe responses in 3D spheroid and paper-
based co-cultures. The high-throughput nature of this IVIVE pipeline makes it ideal for screening libraries of
potential toxicants, providing information-rich datasets of spatially and temporally resolved morphological and
molecular changes across the tissue-like structures."
10888994,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the US. Immunotherapy seeks to bolster immune cells’
ability to target malignant cells and has brought immense improvements in the field. One important inhibitory
protein in T cells, Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1), has become an invaluable target for cancer
immunotherapy. While anti-PD-1 antibody therapy is extremely successful in some patients, in many others, it
fails to help or causes complications, including cancer hyper-progression and immune-related adverse events.
Study of the inhibitory transmembrane protein Phosphoprotein Associated with Glycosphingolipid Rich
Microdomains 1 (PAG), a downstream target of PD-1 signaling, will help us better understand the PD-1 pathway,
and offer another, perhaps more nuanced, target to potentially improve response rates and/or avoid immune-
related adverse events. As a link between lipid-rich/signaling-protein-rich membrane regions and the actin
cytoskeleton, PAG is an exciting and novel target for manipulating immune function. Prior therapeutic methods
of immune manipulation all disrupt ligand binding or enzyme function. In contrast, innovative use of an anti-PAG
antibody to simply disrupt appropriate PAG localization within the synapse could disturb immune synapse
architecture. Synapse organization is tightly regulated to prevent inappropriate immune responses, but the
precise interaction between cytoskeletal dynamics and synaptic organization is not fully understood.
Investigating the role of PAG in this process could provide added clarity. To test the hypothesis that PAG
works with actin to control T cell synapse organization and facilitate T cell receptor (TCR) and PD-1
signaling, PAG will be studied in a human T cell line and a murine PAG-knockout model. Methods will include
confocal and TIRF microscopy, FRET and proximity ligation assay, flow cytometry, ELISA, adhesion and
cytotoxicity assays, and murine tumor models. To understand the contribution of the actin binding domain of
PAG on its localization, protein-protein interactions, and T cell activation and effector functions, the primary
hypothesis will be examined through the following specific aims: Aim 1. Define the role of the PAG-actin link
in driving T cell synapse architecture and stability. Aim 2. Determine the impact of PAG-actin interactions
on T cell functions downstream of TCR and PD-1 signaling. Aim 1 will demonstrate the role of PAG in T cells
synapse anatomy, and the physical impacts of a PAG-targeting therapy. Aim 2 will illuminate which PD-1
downstream targets are dependent on the PAG-actin link, and provide evidence for whether PAG and PD-1
could serve as good co-targets in cancer therapy regimens. Ultimately, this study will illuminate crucial control
mechanisms associated with T cell synapse organization, opening more avenues of targeting the immune
synapse. Furthermore, the mentorship and resources in Dr. Adam Mor’s lab and the Columbia MSTP, will foster
invaluable technical and professional skill development for a career in medicine and immunology research."

The EphB4-p120RasGAP signaling axis is critical for vascular development and mutations in both EphB4 and
p120RasGAP are associated with vascular disorders including Vein of Galen Malformation (VOGM) and
Capillary Malformation-Arteriovenous Malformation (CM-AVM) Syndrome. One key protein along this pathway,
p120RasGAP (RasGAP), is particularly under studied. Despite RasGAP being the first GTPase Activating
Protein (GAP) discovered it is still unclear how RasGAP is regulated. RasGAP contains two SH2 domains,
allowing it to signal downstream of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, such as the receptor tyrosine kinase
EphB4 and the RhoGAP p190RhoGAP (p190). Multiple tyrosine phosphorylated binding partners of RasGAP
elicit different signaling outcomes, and previous studies suggest these binding partners may influence RasGAP
activity. However, the molecular basis for how this occurs is unknown. Uncovering how these binding
partners regulate RasGAP’s activity paves the way to understand how mutations associated with VOGM and
CM-AVM might disrupt this regulation. In this proposal I will conduct structural, biophysical, and enzymatic
studies to test the hypothesis phosphotyrosine-containing binding partners regulate RasGAP’s signaling
activity. Aim 1: To determine the effects of non-catalytic domains, binding partner interactions, and mutations
on GAP regulation. Due to studies in cell extract and immunoprecipated protein, phosphorylated binding partners
are hypothesized to influence RasGAP’s GAP activity. However, there have been no studies performed using
purified proteins to assess this hypothesis. In Aim 1 I propose in purified protein fluorescent GAP assays to
determine how RasGAP’s non-catalytic domains, binding partners, and disease mutations influence GAP
activity. Aim 2: To determine conformational changes in RasGAP upon different binding partner interactions.
Despite the importance of the EphB4-RasGAP interaction it is still unknown how these proteins interact. A
structure determined in the Boggon Lab of RasGAP’s N-terminal domains with a doubly phosphorylated p190
peptide show it is impossible for EphB4’s phosphotyrosine residues to engage RasGAP the same way.
Therefore, in Aim 2 I will determine how EphB4 engages RasGAP and determine the conformational effects on
RasGAP. I propose X-ray crystallography, Small Angle X-ray Scattering, and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry to
probe the conformational changes induced in RasGAP by p190 and EphB4 binding. I will then assess the impact
of disease-associated mutations in the context of these biophysical data and probe the impact of disease-
associated mutations on conformation, structure, and activity."

Peroxisomal ABC transporters like ABCD1, ABCD2, and ABCD3 shuttle very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs),
branched chain fatty acids (BCFAs), and bile acid precursors into peroxisomes. Their functional impairment leads
to severe neurological and metabolic pathologies stemming from disrupted phospholipid and fatty acid
metabolism, including X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), both the most common leukodystrophy and most
common peroxisomal disorder that is caused by mutations in ABCD1 and for which no cure exists, and bile acid
synthesis defects and liver disease stemming from impaired ABCD3 function. While additional roles for ABCD
transporters in a wider array of disease pathways continue to be uncovered, the underlying mechanisms
governing their substrate recognition, transport, and transport regulation remain poorly understood. The long-
term objectives of this project are to gain insight into peroxisomal ABCD transporter function and regulation in
molecular detail. We will use a combination of biochemical and cell biological tools, high resolution structural
analysis by cryo-electron microscopy, and continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR)
spectroscopy to reveal the functionally relevant structural features and conformational states used by ABCD
transporters in fatty acid translocation, how they may be altered by ABCD1 mutation in X-ALD, and how ABCD1
is mechanistically distinct from ABCD2 and ABCD3 despite their functional overlap. Specific Aim 1 deals with
the development and utilization of in vitro assays for determining substrate specificity profiles and transport
properties of ABCD1, ABCD2, and ABCD3. Specific Aim 2 deals with obtaining high resolution structural
information of ABCD1, ABCD2, and ABCD3 in functionally relevant states in a physiological lipid environment
through cryo-EM analysis. Specific Aim 3 deals obtaining information on the structural dynamics of ABCD1
through CW-EPR studies. Our results will provide fundamental insights into peroxisomal ABC transporter
functioning that can be exploited for ABCD1 targeted diagnostic and therapeutic tools to improve X-ALD patient
outcomes, provide a framework for the design and development of chemical probes to study ABCD family
function, and generate reliable in vitro and in silico tools to accelerate drug development/discovery efforts
targeting them."

Childhood obesity remains a significant public health problem and obesity risk begins early in life. There is a
need for accessible and comprehensive interventions focused on modifiable behaviors in infancy. This
proposal is an efficacy trial for the virtual Mothers and CareGivers Investing in Children (MAGIC) FEED+
program designed to foster responsive bottle and infant feeding and healthy eating habits starting in infancy,
compared to an attention control arm. Our pilot work has successfully implemented the MAGIC-FEED program
with responsive feeding coaching and focusing on complementary feeding to under and un-insured families in
the Austin area. The proposed research builds upon our partnerships and expands the intervention period to
earlier in infancy to include responsive bottle- and breast-ffeeding and includes longer-term follow up of infants
to disentangle the role of the intervention on child self-regulatory behaviors and longer-term adiposity. Our trial
will enroll 266 predominately low-income and Hispanic caregivers in early infancy and will deliver the
intervention starting at child age 3 weeks with intervention visits at 3 weeks, and 3, 6, 8, and 10 months. In-
person assessments of growth and body composition and child self-regulation will occur at child age 3 weeks,
and 13 and 24 months. Aim 1 focuses on main intervention effects on child growth and body composition. Aim
2 focuses on intervention effects on caregiver nutrition knowledge, and quality, caregiver responsive feeding
and child self-regulation, and examines the effect of MAGIC-FEED+ and the role of potential drivers of growth
(caregiver feeding practices and child self-regulatory skills) in infancy on children’s propensity to eat in the
absence of hunger and adiposity/body fat at 24 months. Aim 3 determines whether MAGIC-FEED+
demonstrates the factors necessary to be a successful intervention for broader dissemination. This proposal is
the first dynamic and interactive virtual trial designed to support heathy breast-, bottle and complementary
feeding with robust measurements of responsive feeding, self-regulation and adiposity. These results will
inform a pragmatic trial, and if effective, the MAGIC-FEED+ program is poised for wide dissemination and
public health impact."
10890065,"Targeting eIF4A1 in drug-resistant breast cancer stem-like cells
 The overarching goal of this project is to delineate the regulatory mechanisms by which the helicase activity
of eIF4A1 controls pluripotency TFs and ABC drug transporters and how this can be exploited to overcome drug
resistance in metastatic TNBC. Currently, despite significant improvements in the survival rates of primary breast
cancer patients, 90% of the mortality is due to chemoresistance from aggressive tumors leading to metastasis.
Neoadjuvant hemotherapy (NACT) is the mainstay of treatment though poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)
inhibitors are available along with immunotherapy. The pathological complete response (pCR) is generally low
in TNBC patients. Resistance to NACT and also to targeted therapy is mainly due to a small population of breast
cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs) or tumor-initiating cells. BCSCs are intrinsically chemoresistant with high
plasticity and self-renewal capability. Their proliferative and invasive capacity mediates tumorigenesis, immune
evasion and metastasis. Acquired resistance to chemo- and immunotherapy also develops during treatment.
Following such therapy, the bulk tumor cells die but BCSCs survive and constitute the minimal residual disease
(MRD). The surviving pluripotent BCSCs can undergo multi-lineage differentiation and repopulate the entire
heterogeneous tumor. This leads to tumor relapse which are more aggressive and highly metastatic in nature.
Tumors with high expression of BCSC stemness markers (ALDH and CD44) demonstrate worst clinical
outcomes in TNBC patients. Thus, there is an unmet need for identifying novel targets and strategically target
BCSCs to overcome chemoresistance, eliminate MRD and achieve better pCR in metastatic TNBC (mTNBC).
 In this study, we propose to find the mechanisms by which the helicase activity of eIF4A1 regulates
pluripotency, ABC transporters that contribute to chemoresistance. We propose in aim 1 to determine the role of
the helicase activity of eIF4A1 in the regulation of pluripotency and ABC transporters in vitro. In aim2, we will
determine the role of the helicase activity of eIF4A1 in the regulation of pluripotency and ABC transporters in
vivo. In aim3 we propose to translate the findings in aim1 and 2 to preclinical PDX and CDX murine models. This
will facilitate in developing novel combination therapies effective in mTNBC and hopefully translate it into human
phase I trial."
10890066,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Maternal obesity, gestational diabetes, and childhood obesity are part of a vicious cycle. Almost half of all
reproductive-aged women in the United States are overweight or obese. Overweight and obese women are up
to 6 times more likely to develop GDM than normal weight women. Children exposed to GDM in utero have an
8-fold greater type 2 diabetes risk and a 2-fold greater obesity risk, perpetuating the cycle. Increasing physical
activity and sleep during pregnancy may help mitigate these risks. These behaviors are interrelated: improving
one (e.g. getting more physical activity) could occur at the expense of another (e.g. getting enough sleep). The
ideal daily pattern of physical activity and sleep to prevent pregnancy complications and subsequent childhood
obesity risk factors is unknown. Despite the interrelated nature of these behaviors, prior research on physical
activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep during pregnancy in overweight and obese pregnanct women has
focused on individual associations of these behaviors with perinatal outcomes. How the interdependent
relationships between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep within a 24-hour movement framework
affect perinatal outcomes remains unclear. The goal of this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award is to
facilitate my transition to becoming an independent researcher with expertise in the 24-hour movement
framework during pregnancy to ultimately develop interventions and guidelines for 24-hour movement during
this critical period. During the Mentored (K99) Phase of this award, I will pursue training in the analysis of
accelerometer-measured physical activity data, the physiology and measurement of sleep, and practical skills
in research study conduct, including recruitment and retention, under the mentorship of Dr. Monique
Hedderson (Primary Mentor), Dr. Kelley Pettee Gabriel (Co-Mentor and expert in accelerometer-measured
physical activity within a 24-hour movement framework), and Dr. Rachel Manber (Co-Mentor and expert in
sleep during pregnancy). My research during the Mentored Phase will 1) assess whether 24-hour movement
profiles during early pregnancy are associated with late pregnancy maternal metabolic biomarkers, and 2)
assess whether 24-hour movement profiles during early and late pregnancy are associated with delivering
infants with childhood obesity risk factors using data from an existing study among overweight and obese
pregnant women. In the Independent (R00) Phase of this award, I will examine longitudinal relationships of 24-
hour movement profiles during pregnancy with glucose tolerance, birthweight, and neonatal adiposity by
creating a cohort of overweight and obese pregnant women with daily, device-based measurement of physical
activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep across pregnancy. These training and research activities will prepare
me to successfully compete for R01 funding to support further investigation of 24-hour movement profiles and
pregnancy outcomes in high-risk populations of pregnant women."
10890075,"Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has led to dramatic increases in lifespan among HIV-infected
individuals. Despite effective cART, however, HIV-associated morbidities exert a significant toll. HIV-
associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) occur in up to 50% of chronically infected individuals despite
cART. The pathogenesis of HAND remains under investigation. Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of HAND,
as established by clinical studies, autopsy studies, and animal models. Ongoing or intermittent replication of
HIV in the CNS is likely to contribute to neuroinflammation through direct effects on the infected cells or
through release of viral proteins and inflammatory mediators. Use of neural stimulants including
methamphetamine can exacerbate the neurocognitive decline seen in HAND, but the mechanisms
underlying this comorbidity are not understood. Microglia are the primary resident myeloid cells of the brain,
are infected at early times following acute infection with HIV or SIV, can act as a CNS viral reservoir, and
are thought to play a central role in the development of HAND. The pathways responsible for microglial
activation and dysfunction following HIV infection remain incompletely defined. Microglia derived from
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a unique opportunity to examine the molecular mechanisms
underlying microglial activation. iPSC-derived microglia will be introduced into cerebral organoids, providing
the additional opportunity to define the effects of microglial activation on surrounding astrocytes, neurons,
and other cells. Tetherin is a host restriction factor that captures HIV during the assembly process in
infected cells and generates a proinflammatory signaling cascade within infected cells. Experiments in Aim
1 of this project will evaluate HIV-induced neuroinflammation both in an unbiased way and through a
directed evaluation of the role of tetherin-mediated signaling as a trigger of microglial inflammation.
RNAseq, cytokine production, and immunofluorescence microscopy will be employed to define microglial
activation following HIV infection. In Aim 2, we will introduce HIV-infected microglia into cerebral organoids
to define the molecular basis of HIV-induced neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction. Single-cell
RNAseq and evaluation of neuronal health and electrophysiology will be performed in models representing
acute infection and in ART-suppressed, chronic infection of the brain. The potential of methamphetamine to
contribute to neuroinflammation and neuronal damage in the HIV-infected microglia/organoid model will
then be defined, and the relevant pathways identified. Together, these studies will provide insights into the
pathogenesis of HAND and the potential contribution of methamphetamine to neurocognitive decline."
10890142,"This application for the ""Allogeneic Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) Injection in Patients with Hypoplastic
Left Heart Syndrome: A Phase IIb Clinical Trial (ELPIS)"" Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) is collaborative with
the ELPIS Data Coordinating Center (DCC) application. The CCC will have ultimate responsibility for managing
the ELPIS clinical consortium of six clinical sites, meeting, planning enrollment milestones, distributing CCC
resources, and overseeing all aspects of clinical design of the studies. Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS)
is one of the most complex forms of congenital heart disease (CHD), with a reported incidence of 0.2 per 1000
live births or 3% of children born with CHD. Once a universally fatal diagnosis, dramatic improvements in three
staged palliative operations now allow the single right ventricle (RV) to functionally support the circulation.
Despite these strides in medical care, the mortality rate of these infants remains as high as 25 to 35 percent
during the first year of life and continues with a high mortality rate for the rest of their life. Those surviving
childhood are likely to progress towards cardiac transplantation, usually due to failure of the systemic RV. To
address this RV dysfunction, our stem cell trial is based on a decade of basic research and the ELPIS Phase I
study using allogeneic MSCs in HLHS patients at the Stage II operation. Our completed enrolled ELPIS Phase
I study supports both the feasibility for this investigative strategy and the safety profile of the allogeneic MSCs.
Secondary endpoints demonstrated that the initial MSC treated patients showed by cardiac MRI (CMR) no
difference in RV ejection fraction, or end diastolic volumes, however a significant decrease in RV mass was
present, a surrogate for decreased hypertrophy. Our hypothesis for this trial is that intramyocardial delivery of
allogeneic MSCs will improve the performance of the single systemic RV in HLHS patients at the Stage II
operation. A total of 36 HLHS patients who are undergoing the Stage II operation will be single blinded and
randomized to either receive MSC treatment or standard of care. Patients will be followed for one year. The
primary outcome measurement will be decrease in RV mass as determined by CMR studies at baseline, 6 and
12 months following MSC injection. Secondary outcomes will include improvements in clinical and physiologic
endpoints, improvements seen by other global RV cardiac function parameters measured by serial CMR studies,
exosome biomarker analysis and safety endpoints. This single blinded randomized clinical trial is designed to
address the following specific aims: (1) to analyze MSC delivery for RV function improvement at the Stage II
operation; (2) to determine dynamic changes of the amount and composition of plasma biomarkers derived from
the transplanted MSCs; and (3) to analyze safety of MSC treatment. Although not planned as a survival study,
we anticipate that the proposed study will provide valuable data on the safety and benefit of MSC treatment in
HLHS patients. The sufficiently definitive information will inform the decision on whether to proceed with a Phase
III clinical trial of therapeutic MSC delivery to reduce mortality in HLHS patients and to direct its study design."

10907852,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Older adults (age ≥ 60 years) tend to be less physically active than younger adults, engaging in less than 11%
of recommended physical activity (PA) levels[1-3]. These trends are even lower in older individuals from Black
communities. Lack of PA in older adults is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, especially in
the Black population[4]. Large population-based studies suggest that moderate levels of PA provide protection
from chronic diseases in older adults[5]. Therefore, interventions aimed at improving PA in older Black adults
could significantly improve health outcomes and help to reduce health disparities among this population. To
increase PA in older, Black adults, we use the socioecological perspective[7] to examine the barriers and
facilitators at each level of influence (i.e., intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational/community,
environmental/policy). A PA intervention developed for older, Black adults that targets multiple levels of the
socioecological model is needed. The evidence-based Fit and Strong! (F&S!) program for older adults, funded
by the National Institute of Aging, can be optimized to bypass these barriers and effectively engaged older
Black adults in sustained PA. Although the F&S! program has been successfully implemented in multiple
community-based, ethnically diverse settings, it is limited because it is only offered in-person (i.e., no online
component) and ends at 8 weeks with very little ongoing support. These limitations not only increase the cost
and reduce the accessibility of the program but also fail to optimize or support gains made as improvements in
PA during F&S! diminish over the follow-up phase[8]. We will bypass these limitations and develop an adjunct,
online platform to the F&S! program that is capable of syncing with wearable devices (e.g., fitbit). To create this
platform as well as examine its feasibility and acceptability, we will partner with the Black Ministerial Alliance of
Greater Boston (BMA), an organization of predominantly Black churches, and administer the program in these
churches in Boston, MA. Consistent with this FOA “to provide support for up to two years (R21 phase) for
research planning activities and feasibility studies” we will conduct: 1) focus groups in two BMA-affiliated
churches to better understand the key barriers necessary to bypass at every level of the socioecological model
and then build this adjunct, online program to create the F&S!-Online program and 2) an open pilot study
(N=30) across these two churches to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the F&S!-Online program. Per
the FOA, the R21 will be, “followed by a possible transition to expanded research support (R33 phase) for
optimizing the intervention and conducting larger-scale feasibility studies”. Consistently, for the R33 phase, we
will conduct a larger scale feasibility study by randomizing four BMA-affiliated churches to either F&S!-Online
or the standard F&S! (N=120) to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the online adjunct platform as
well as pilot its efficacy and sustainability."
10890432,"Abstract
 Lipid Droplets (LDs) and their associated proteins are known to play a major role in regulating lipid
metabolism and storage at the cellular level. Most cell types typically contain some LDs under homeostatic
conditions, but excessive accumulation of LDs can be indicative of several pathologies, depending on the tissue.
The majority of studies focused on abnormal accumulation of LDs have been conducted in the liver regarding
stenosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or adipose tissue in the context of obesity. However, the
accumulation of LDs has also been observed in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), and
likely represent the “adipose saccules” in neuroglia first described by Dr. Alois Alzheimer.
 The expression of a specific LD protein, Perilipin-2 (Plin2), has consistently been shown to correlate with
the presence and abundance of LDs within a cell or tissue. Plin2 to is known for being involved in the stabilization
of LDs and regulating the access of the LD to enzymes like lipases. Others have shown that modulating the
expression of Plin2 directly effects the accessibility and turnover of LDs, where higher levels of Plin2 expression
leads to accumulation and little turnover of LDs, and lower levels of Plin2 expression are associated with
increased LD turnover and fewer LDs overall. In mice, others have observed alleviation of diet-induced obesity,
adipose inflammatory foci, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis in the liver through the conditional loss of Plin2 in
the adipose or liver tissue respectively. One study in particular shows that Plin2-/- mice given a cuprizone-
induced demyelinating diet have significantly increased levels of remyelination following the return to a normal
diet, and macrophages derived from these mice had fewer lipid droplets and displayed a less inflammatory
phenotype. To our knowledge, no studies have targeted neuroglia with a conditional Plin2 KO which leads us to
question how the loss of Plin2 would affect lipid droplet accumulation and dysregulated lipid metabolism
observed in aging and neurodegeneration. This is a key knowledge gap to understanding lipid metabolism in AD
which we hope to bridge through our proposed aims.
 Specifically, we hypothesize that a reduction in Plin2 expression will alleviate several pathologies
associated with AD by increasing LD turnover and decreasing neuroinflammation. We will first generate novel
cell-specific Plin2 KO mice that we will then cross with 5xFAD mice to specifically remove Plin2 from either
astrocytes or microglia and determine the effects of Plin2 on AD. Then we will investigate how the removal of
Plin2 effects phagocytosis activity within microglia and either capacity to clear unwanted debris. Lastly, we will
determine the role that Plin2 plays on impairments commonly seen in cells carrying APOE4, the greatest
genetic risk factor for late-onset AD."

The Summer Healthcare Experience (SHE) in Oncology is a virtual, multi-institutional STEM enrichment program
for high school students, with a mission to increase participation of women from underrepresented backgrounds
in the cancer biomedical workforce. The curriculum offers hands-on research experience, career exploration,
mentorship, and leadership training, drawing strategically from the unique strengths and resources of five of the
nation’s top cancer centers: University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of
Kentucky Markey Cancer Center, University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania
Abramson Cancer Center, and the University of Texas at Austin Livestrong Cancer Institutes. Programming is
delivered collaboratively and synchronously across the five sites, connecting trainees to an expansive network
of peers, mentors, and opportunities in cancer research and care. The program’s multi-institutional structure also
creates rich context for the study of social determinants of health, barriers to care, and other factors undermining
cancer health equity within the centers’ respective catchment areas (and participants’ respective communities,
including rural, urban, racially diverse, and socioeconomically challenged). In summers 2021 and 2022, 169
participants completed a pilot version of the SHE program, 99% of whom identified as female and 65% as
underrepresented in the sciences. Pilot outcomes reflect significant gains in trainees’ scientific knowledge,
biomedical career awareness, and confidence and sense of belonging in STEM. SHE trainees also report that
the program enhanced important generalizable skills including critical thinking, self-directed learning, and the
ability to communicate scientific concepts. This proposal details plans to expand SHE in fundamental ways
including year-round programming, formalized support for program alumni, and rigorous evaluation to validate
and strengthen the SHE program model for expansion to new institutional cohorts nationwide."

Attending to informative stimuli is critical for choosing appropriate actions, but the biological mechanisms
underlying this ability are not well understood. Recent theoretical models of computational rationality propose
that an executive meta-level controller regulates the precision of a cognitive process (e.g., learning or memory)

yet to account for the control of attention to obtain information (reduce uncertainty) and have been limited to
mathematical formalisms rather than biologically plausible architectures. In a Targeted BRAIN Circuits R01, we
will fill these gaps by investigating the cellular and neuromodulatory mechanisms of attention control in visual
and executive structures – i.e., the monkey lateral intraparietal area (LIP) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) –
in conjunction with a neurocognitive model developed by the PIs, the attention reinforcement meta-learner (A-
RML). We will test the novel hypotheses that (1) stimuli compete for control of saccades based on their
diagnosticity (predictive accuracy about future events) and the competition is sharpened in favor of more
diagnostic predictors by higher decision uncertainty and (2) dACC and LIP, and DA and NE have distinct roles
in, respectively, the valuation and implementation of an attentional policy. In the current planning proposal, we
set the stage for this goal providing behavioral evidence for our hypothesis (Aim 1), and (2) establishing the
feasibility of using, in monkeys, novel fluorescent molecular sensors – GRAB – that have been demonstrated in
rodents to measure neurotransmitter release with much greater temporal and pharmacological specificity relative
to current techniques (Aim 2). In the full RO1 we will use these tools to obtain high precision measurements of
neuromodulator release in relation to information gathering and neural activity, validate and further extend the
A-RML based on empirical observations, and interrogating the circuit using causal manipulations. The results
will provide a novel account of attention control that spans cellular and neuromodulatory mechanisms and a
computational account linking attention with Bayesian theories of uncertainty minimization."
10888031,"Project Summary/Abstract (Description)
Motivation: There is growing evidence that impaired renal oxygenation (an increased ratio of oxygen
consumption to oxygen delivery) is a common characteristic of deteriorated kidney function. This includes
conditions such as acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), the transition from AKI to CKD, and
further progression to end-stage renal disease. Approximately half of all patients undergoing chemotherapeutic
treatment benefit from platinum-based antineoplastic drugs. However, these drugs are nephrotoxic, which limits
both the dosage that can be safely administered and the population that can receive it. Noninvasive monitoring
and repeatable measurement of intrarenal tissue oxygenation, an area that continues to present an unmet clinical
need, will enhance the clinical management of AKI, CKD, and the determination of dosage and selection of
chemotherapeutic regimens in cancer patients.
The renal oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), expressed as the ratio of the difference between arterial and venous
oxygen saturation to arterial oxygen saturation, can serve as a quantitative biomarker of renal tissue oxygen
tension. An increased OEF suggests impaired tissue oxygenation, implying a decrease in renal oxygen tension,
assuming that blood oxygen tension is in balance with the surrounding tissue. MRI has the potential to offer 3D
volumetric, voxel-by-voxel noninvasive quantification of deoxyhemoglobin concentration and OEF through
advanced signal modeling. However, there are major challenges to overcome: 1) respiratory and/or bulk motion
in the abdomen, 2) flow-induced errors, 3) the presence of large susceptibility and fat, and 4) the lack of advanced
algorithms that effectively calculate OEF. This project aims to address these major challenges.
Approach: This project is highly focused on the technological development of MRI. Aim 1 intends to enable a
fully flow-compensated multi-echo 3D non-Cartesian MRI method that is robust to respiratory motion. This MRI
technique will continuously acquire a navigation signal from which respiratory and/or bulk motion can be
extracted, thereby enabling robust retrospective motion-resolved kidney image reconstruction. Aim 2 will focus
on the development of: 1) joint multi-echo and respiratory motion-resolved image reconstruction, 2) total field
inversion for renal quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and 3) OEF mapping from a signal model that
combines the magnitude-based quantitative blood oxygen level dependent (qBOLD) and the phase-based QSM.
Aim 3 will evaluate the sensitivity of the developed renal OEF mapping method on healthy subjects before and
after an induced alteration in renal oxygenation.
Significance: This work will lead to free-breathing renal functional MRI that enables noninvasive voxel-by-voxel
quantification of renal OEF. This technique will facilitate its widespread use as a quantitative imaging biomarker
of renal tissue oxygen tension in both research and clinical settings."
10888059,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Oregon Health & Science University School of Dentistry (OHSU SOD) is launching a new initiative to
promote oral healthcare careers among high school learners. Most high schoolers have extremely limited
knowledge of the wide diversity of career paths in healthcare and may not have considered oral health as a
viable track. Oregon has a low percentage of historically under-represented racial and ethnic groups (HURE) in
professional and research careers. This proposal will take the first step to meet these needs by immersing and
engaging high school learners, particularly from under-represented and diverse backgrounds, in pathways to
careers in dentistry and dental, oral, and craniofacial research.
We are seeking to raise awareness of and provide opportunities for oral health-related research internships
and clinical experiences. Currently, there is no program in Oregon that provides such experiences, and as the
only dental school in the state, OHSU SOD is uniquely qualified to deliver cutting-edge research and clinical
care experiences to our high schoolers. A team of OHSU SOD faculty will provide an explorer’s program
throughout the school year, a paid summer research experience, and touchpoint activities in the community
and around the state to open the windows to learners to the careers in the oral health field. Our WINDOWS
program will be a model to other schools across the country of a pathway program for high school learners
integrating research with clinical dentistry and integrating oral health research with biomedical research."

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic debilitating joint disease, affecting over 32 million people in the USA with an
economic impact of $550 billion/year. OA is characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage, typically
affecting the back, hands, knees, and hips. A significant correlation between inflammation and disease severity
has been observed in human and animal models of OA. Increased inflammation in the synovial fluid has also
been shown to inhibit chondrocyte proliferation limiting cartilage repair and promoting OA disease progression.
No therapy is available to slow the progression of OA and current treatments only attempt to relieve the
symptoms. New therapeutics that promote regulation of inflammation have the potential to alleviate the OA
pathology and arrest the disease progression. The impact of fetal development on the immune system varies
depending on the stage of embryo development with a delicate balance between immune tolerance and protective
immunity. Several extrinsic and intrinsic factors through epigenetic and transcriptional programs skew the adaptive
immune response towards increased expression of immunosuppressive signaling intermediates including Helios that
favors the expansion of Tregs. Exosomes play a critical role in cross talk between different biological systems. In this
study we will leverage the immunoregulatory mechanisms in play during the fetal development to treat OA by
identifying the stage of muti-tissue organoid (MTO)-development that yields exosomes with anti-inflammatory and
chondrocyte proliferation potential in in vitro studies using human PBMCs to facilitate clinical translation. We will
analyze the epigenetic and transcriptomic reprograming induced by the MTO-derived exosomes that promote
expansion of iTregs that can play a critical role in the regulation of inflammation in OA. We will also test the MTO-
derived exosomes to alleviate OA symptoms in a rat model of OA. The studies will also identify protein and miRNA in
the MTO-derived exosomal cargo that correlates with anti-inflammatory and chondrocyte proliferation potential that
can be developed into potency assays for use in future clinical trials for evaluation of the MTO-derived exosomes."

DNA cytosine methylation (5-methylcytosine or 5mC) is a key epigenetic modification in the
regulation of human gene expression. It plays critical roles in suppressing transcription of a
large portion of human genome, including repetitive elements. 5mC can be reversed through
oxidation by the human TET family enzymes, which utilize dioxygen to sequentially oxidize 5mC
to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and finally 5-carboxycytosine
(5caC). Both 5fC and 5caC can be recognized and excised by human thymine DNA glycosylase
(TDG), followed by base excision repair (BER) to replace the modified cytosine with a normal
cytosine, in an active demethylation process. Cell-type specific DNA methylation has been
studied and applied as a biomarker for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Antibody-based
MeDIP immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing is a common method for
genome-wide mapping of DNA 5mC distribution, but it is not quantitative and requires a
significant amount of input material. Bisulfite sequencing is the gold standard approach, widely
applied in quantitative 5mC sequencing; however, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing is
expensive and causes severe DNA degradation. To overcome these critical barriers to
progress, we propose to develop new methods that combine 5mC enrichment with quantitative
5mC sequencing, using limited starting material. The potential application of these new methods
in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analyses stands to potentially revolutionize human disease
diagnosis and prognosis. Whereas the 5mC modification suppress activation of a majority of
human genome, studies from us and others revealed that 5hmC marks active loci. We
previously developed robust procedures to map 5hmC genome-wide using 1,000 cells.
However, quantitative methods that determine the presence and stoichiometry of 5hmC at the
single-cell level are still lacking. Our ongoing efforts to overcome this challenge recently led to a
chemical solution that yields base-resolution 5hmC information with modification stoichiometry,
using limited input material. In this renewal, we propose base resolution sequencing of 5hmC at
the single-cell level, enabling the detection of intercellular differences that are otherwise missed,
including the epigenome remodeling that underlies the initiation of cell fates during early
embryogenesis. The success of this program will provide new methods for 5mC and 5hmC
mapping to enable breakthrough discoveries in both basic research and clinical applications."

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease characterized by vasculopathy,
inflammation, and fibrosis, and has the highest case specific mortality rate of all systemic autoimmune
rheumatic diseases. Interstitial lung disease (ILD), a closely related group of lung disorders characterized by
alveolar inflammation, injury, and fibrosis not due to infection or neoplasia, affects 40-60% of adults with SSc
and is the primary cause of death and hospitalization in this population. Treatments for SSc-ILD are limited,
and no studies have tested interventions to prevent the development of SSc-ILD. Vasculopathy is a hallmark of
SSc and one of its earliest manifestations. We hypothesize that endothelial damage and microvascular injury
are critical inciting events in the pathogenesis of SSc-ILD, and are therefore potential novel treatment targets
for the prevention of SSc-ILD. The overarching goal of this proposal is to elucidate the relationships between
the pulmonary and peripheral microvasculature, endothelial function, lung function, and ILD in adults with SSc.
We will perform a prospective cohort study of 100 adults with SSc in which we will combine structural,
functional, and molecular approaches to understand how the vascular compartment contributes to the
development of ILD in SSc. In Aim 1, we will quantify the pulmonary microvascular perfused blood volume in
SSc and SSc-ILD and determine its relationship to peripheral microvascular structure and lung function. In Aim
2, we will compare peripheral microvascular endothelial function between SSc patients with and without ILD
and determine the relationship between peripheral microvascular endothelial function and pulmonary
microvascular perfusion, peripheral microvascular structure, and lung function in adults with SSc. In Aim 3, we
will perform single cell RNA sequencing of circulating endothelial cells to uncover the molecular mechanisms
that distinguish adults with SSc from those with SSc-ILD. Our study has the potential to generate paradigm-
shifting results that will (1) change the way we conceptualize the putative causal relationship between
microvascular disease and ILD in SSc, (2) identify novel outcome measures for use in SSc-ILD clinical trials,
and (3) enable us to develop new treatments for the primary and secondary prevention of SSc-ILD. We
anticipate that the results of this study will inform and be applicable to other fibrotic lung diseases, thereby
paving the way toward novel therapeutic approaches."

This project – Tomorrow’s Science Today: preparing for the next pandemic – will create a professional
development experience for high school science teachers focused on infectious diseases and the
molecular technologies that are being used to control them. The project consists of two distinct phases.
In the first, we will create a variety of hands-on instructional materials – composed of both foam-based
schematic models and accurate 3D-printed models of proteins – to bring to life molecular stories of the
process of science. We will use a framework that emphasizes how the foundational concepts of
molecular biology established in the past (Yesterday’s Science) provides the basis for the amazing
technology that has been brought to bear on the current SARS-Cov-2 pandemic (Today’s Science) and
also lays the ground-work for even more powerful defenses in the future (Tomorrow’s Science).
In the second phase of this project, we will create a professional learning experience in which the
project’s instructional materials will be introduced to high school science teachers. The project’s goals
are (i) to increase the teachers’ content knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms of infectious
diseases and (ii) to model for the teachers a student-centered active learning pedagogy that values
questions over answers. The project features a formal teacher empowerment program in which a small
group of veteran teachers are trained to serve as mentors for teachers who are new to the project.
High school biology and chemistry teachers will be recruited into this project via presentations and
exhibits at state, regional and national meetings of science educators. A plan is in place to proactively
accept teachers from schools with a significant population of underserved minority students. And
finally, the broad dissemination of the project’s instructional materials will be achieved through our
established partnerships with other science outreach organizations whose programs focus on URM
students in urban Milwaukee, Chicago and rural Nebraska and South Dakota."
10888417,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Obesity and obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases are growing causes of morbidity and mortality in the U.S.
and around the world. Obesity develops when nutrient intake exceeds the body's energy demands, leading to
storage of excess calories and weight gain. As such, mechanisms regulating the body's energy demands serve
as attractive targets for treating obesity and related diseases. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an important organ
regulating energy use in mammals. During exposure to cold, BAT activates UCP1, which uncouples nutrient
consumption from ATP production, releasing the energy instead as heat, a process called thermogenesis. BAT
thermogenesis relies on utilization of a variety of metabolic substrates. An underexplored metabolic substrate in
the context of BAT thermogenesis is lactate. Under basal conditions, lactate metabolism plays a predominant
role in whole-body carbon flux. However, it remains unknown how systemic and BAT lactate metabolism changes
during cold exposure or what role lactate metabolism plays in thermogenesis. BAT activation induces expression
of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the enzyme mediating interconversion of lactate to pyruvate. Stimulation of
BAT also causes tissue lactate levels to fall, suggesting lactate may be consumed during thermogenesis. Thus,
I hypothesize that during cold exposure, BAT consumes lactate via LDH and that this contributes to
thermogenesis. In Aim 1, I will utilize stable isotope tracing approaches in mice to determine how cold exposure
affects systemic and BAT lactate fluxes. Further, I will inhibit LDH activity in BAT via an inducible UCP1-
driven knockout of LDHA, the primary LDH isoform in BAT, to test whether BAT net consumes or produces
lactate by measuring whether lactate levels rise or fall relative to other substrates following LDH inhibition. In
Aim 2, I will utilize my genetic model to test whether LDH is important for BAT thermogenesis by measuring
cold tolerance and β adrenergic-induced BAT activation in the knockout mice relative to controls. These studies
serve as the basis for my pre-doctoral fellowship application awarded to M.D./Ph.D. applicants. My training plan
is focused on preparing me for a career as a physician-scientist. Through this highly clinically relevant research,
combined with continued exposure to clinical medicine, I will develop the skills necessary to successfully blend
basic science and clinical practice in my career. Under the excellent mentorship of Dr. Zoltan Arany, a physician-
scientist himself, and as part of the well-established M.D./Ph.D. program at the University of Pennsylvania, I am
in the perfect environment to pursue this exciting career."
10888419,"Sex, Hormones and Identity affect Nociceptive Expression (SHINE)Project Summary
It is often reported that females demonstrate lower pain thresholds and higher sensitivity than males in
experimental pain tests. However, “sex” and “gender” are often used interchangeably to describe these
differences, but genetic sex and gender identity are not always congruent. As a result, human subjects may be
categorized as male or female based upon genetic sex even if they do not identify as a man or woman,
respectively. Transgender (trans) men and women (TM and TW) are a minority group whose gender identity is
different than their genetic sex (as opposed to cisgender men and women; CM and CW). As a result, TM and
TW may experience stigma, prejudice and depression, putting them at greater risk for negative health outcomes
and impacted quality of life. Thus, this understudied community provides a unique opportunity to investigate the
role of gender identity (trans vs. cis), sex assigned at birth (male vs. female) and hormonal status (elevated
testosterone vs. elevated estrogen) on pain and well-being, while providing a better understanding of the needs
of the community. Specific aims of this study include: 1. To determine the impact of gender identity, sex assigned
at birth and hormone status on pain sensitivity. 2. To examine social and psychological factors to contribute to
pain sensitivity in our groups. 3.To quantify differences in immune cell populations and activity between our
groups. With the assistance of local community stakeholders we will recruit the following groups: CM, CW, TM+T
(currently taking exogenous testosterone), TW+E (exogenous estradiol), TM, and TW (n=20/group). We will use
quantitative sensory testing to assess sensitivity to cold, pressure, and heat via standardized protocols. Blood
samples will be taken for assessment of stress and reproductive hormone levels, immune cell populations and
stimulated cytokine release, as well as salivary samples to measure stress reactivity. Finally, questionnaires will
measure pain state, quality of life, voice quality of life, body image, appearance, self-reported health,
masculinity/femininity, community connectedness, gender role, sleep, depression, social support, adverse
childhood experiences and stigma. Together, this will be the first exploration of the impact of gender identity, sex
assigned at birth and hormonal status on quality of life, pain sensitivity and immune cell activity in trans
individuals. This investigation will also provide critical information with respect to the needs of this underserved
and critically understudied population."
10888581,"The CRE2STEM program intends to contextualize STEM education to the culture, experiences, barriers, and

interactions with agencies and organizations engaged in addressing health disparities, low academic
performance in high schools and workforce development to inform a culturally responsive classroom education
in STEM. Ultimately, our hypothesis is that these two elements will impact : 1) the educational system, and
teachers culturally responsive teaching practices, and 2) increase the pool of diverse students with competencies
in STEM motivated and interested in careers in STEM and healthcare. To ensure this contextualization, all
elements of CRE2STEM will be facilitated within an equal, trusted, dedicated, cohesive, organic, and vetted
collaboration with community partners in education known as the Educational Advisory Committee. The
CRE2STEM intervention follows diversity, equity, and inclusion principles as the cornerstone to achieve the
equality and inclusivity that NY state students need to succeed. Aim 1: Curriculum Development to Enhance
Culturally Responsive Education in STEM. This aim will be achieved through a two-week CRE2STEM
Summer Institute for 20 STEM teachers (2 cohorts of 10) from RCSD, year-long professional development, and
experiential opportunities in the community and with URMC investigators for two consecutive years. Aim 2:
Assess the implementation of the CRE2STEM intervention on STEM teachers and students. By
supporting teachers with content, pedagogical tools, and the delivery of culturally responsive STEM curriculum
materials aligned with NGSS, the CRE2STEM educational program aims to create a stronger connection
between students from diverse backgrounds and their STEM experiences. Aim 3: Disseminate classroom
resources and a video-based library of exemplary culturally responsive STEM lessons and shared

Cryptosporidium, an apicomplexan parasite that infects the gastrointestinal epithelium in humans, remains an
important opportunistic pathogen in AIDS patients who do not have access to HAART treatment. This parasite
is also a leading cause of infectious diarrhea and diarrheal-related death in children worldwide. The N6-
methyladenosine (m6 a reversible RNA post-transcriptional modification. Emerging
A) RNA methylation is
evidence from our lab and others has defined m6A RNA methylation as a crucial regulator in host antimicrobial
response. The overall objective of this R21 proposal is to advance our understanding of the molecular
mechanisms by which intestinal epithelial cells control the dynamic of m6A RNA modifications of mRNA
transcripts to orchestrate IFN-γ-mediated epithelial anti-Cryptosporidium defense. We have recently
demonstrated significant alterations in the topology of host m6A mRNA methylome in murine intestinal
epithelial cells following Cryptosporidium infection. Although the RNA levels of several IFN-induced immunity-
related GTPase family M (IRGM) genes are upregulated, a decreased in their m6A RNA methylation level and
translation was identified in infected cells. In contrast, IFN-γ stimulation upregulates the RNA levels of IRGM
genes with an increased m6A RNA methylation and importantly, m6A methylation of IRGM RNAs is associated
with an increased translation. Given the fact that the IRGM proteins are critical effectors in IFN-γ-mediated cell-
autonomous immunity in both mice and humans, we hypothesize that m6A methylation of IRGM mRNA
transcripts promotes IFN-γ-mediated epithelial cell antimicrobial defense and to counteract IFN-γ-mediated
host defense, Cryptosporidium has developed strategies to suppress m6A methylation of IRGM mRNA
transcripts. We will use in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo infection models and complementary biochemical,
molecular, and morphologic approaches to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which m6A methylation of
IRGM mRNA transcripts promotes IFN-γ-mediated intestinal epithelial cell anti-Cryptosporidium defense (Aim
1) and determine how Cryptosporidium suppresses m6A methylation of IRGM mRNA transcripts, resulting in
attenuation of IFN-γ-mediated epithelial anti-parasitic defence (Aim 2). Detailed mechanistic studies of the role
m6A RNA methylation of IRGM transcripts in host-Cryptosporidium interactions could not only reveal new
insights into the molecular immunology and immunopathology of intestinal Cryptosporidium infection but also
establish a foundation on which to build long-term, mechanistic studies to define its pathogenesis and
therapeutic interventaion."

 Autophagy is a cell homeostasis process that involves self-digestion of cellular components. The
substrates of autophagy are enclosed in double-membraned autophagosomes that fuse with lysosomes for
degradation. Autophagy is essential for maintaining cell and tissue integrity, and is implicated in a number of
diseases and conditions. While autophagy has been widely studied in degrading cytoplasmic components, its
role in degrading nuclear materials is poorly understood. I recently discovered that autophagy degrades
nuclear lamina in response to tumorigenic stress, such as activated oncogenes and DNA damage. This
autophagic degradation is through nuclear lamina interaction with autophagy proteins in the nucleus, and a
subsequent nucleus-to-cytoplasm transport, leading to degradation by the cytoplasmic autophagosomes and
lysosomes. This discovery was one of the first illustrations of mammalian autophagy degrading nuclear
components, a process termed as nuclear autophagy. The identification of the first nuclear substrate of
autophagy prompted me to further investigate nuclear perspectives of mammalian autophagy.
 Nuclear autophagy is an emerging new field with tremendous potential to explore new research
avenues. A central goal of my laboratory is to study the biology of nuclear autophagy and its implication in
diseases. In this proposal, I aim to answer a major unaddressed area regarding the nuclear substrates that
can be degraded by autophagy. The application has two directions. First, I propose to investigate a chromatin
remodeling complex that is targeted by nuclear autophagy. Second, I propose to unbiasedly identify novel
substrates of nuclear autophagy, employing advanced quantitative proteomics. My broad hypothesis is that the
degradation of nuclear and chromatin constituents by autophagy mediates homeostasis of the nucleus, which
is a central mechanism of cell stress responses. This study will pioneer a new research direction in the
autophagy field, and may offer insights into several intersecting areas of biomedicine."
10871855,"We will develop the application of a promising novel vascular disrupting agent (VDA) in combination with
leading therapies to enhance treatment of kidney cancer. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is usually characterized
by inactivation of the von Hippel Lindau (vHL) tumor suppressor protein, promoting accumulation of Hypoxia
Inducible Factor (HIF) and consequent development of extensive vasculature. The endothelium of normal
blood vessels is largely quiescent, but the invasive neovasculature of tumors is immature, lacks pericyte
support, and exhibits increased permeability providing a selective target for cancer therapy. The therapeutic
goal of VDAs is to cause rapid widespread disruption of established tumor vasculature leading to regional
ischemia, induction of hypoxia and tumor necrosis. We have identified OXi8007 as a new potent, water-soluble
VDA prodrug generating protracted vascular disruption, dose dependent tumor growth delay and no apparent
systemic toxicity. However, VDA monotherapy generally results in re-growth at the tumor periphery and
OXi8007 will likely be most effective in augmenting current lead therapies based on complementary modes of
action. We will investigate a small-molecule HIF-2 antagonist, PT2977 developed by Peloton Therapeutics,
which represents a new class of chemotherapeutic in early clinical trials. Meanwhile, cabozantinib, the small-
molecule kinase inhibitor that targets the c-MET receptor, AXL, and VEGFR-2 was recently approved as a first
line treatment option for patients with metastatic RCC. We also recognize the emerging success of
immunotherapy and anticipate that OXi8007-induced necrosis will enhance antigen presentation promoting
response. Our overarching hypothesis is that combining these therapeutic approaches will achieve robust long
term control of RCC.
Investigations will benefit from the resources of the UT Southwestern Kidney Cancer SPORE, which has
developed a number of new patient derived tumor lines exhibiting differential sensitivity to HIF-2 antagonists.
Effective therapy combination will likely depend on timing of administration of the respective agents and non-
invasive imaging will reveal the spatial and temporal pharmacodynamics of tumor response. Bioluminescence
imaging (BLI) will effectively interrogate luciferase-transfected RENCA cells in immunocompetent mice. In
addition, recently available multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) non-invasively reveals vascular
extent and regional oxygenation without the need for exogenous reporter molecules or cell transfection.
Complementary cell-based studies are designed to further explore OXi8007 mechanism of action. Effectively
combining targeted therapies should enhance treatment and ultimately survivorship of kidney cancer patients.
The goal of these investigations is to demonstrate effective combination therapy as a foundation for
investigations in large animals and translation to the clinic."

Fine particulate matter (aerodynamic diameter<2.5 μm; PM2.5) is a novel and ubiquitous environmental
neurotoxin affecting neurobehavioral development of millions of American children living in urban areas.
However, our review points to several major methodological limitations and critical knowledge gaps in the extant
literature, including: 1) the lack of studies with longitudinal brain and behavior assessments; 2) relatively small
samples from localized geographical areas; 3) little to no information on long-term cumulative and/or differential
timing of exposure across development; and 4) remaining questions regarding the neurotoxicity of PM2.5
exposure on critical neurobehavioral processes that continue to mature across adolescence. Although animal
neurotoxicology studies have highlighted the importance of sex, there is only limited epidemiologic evidence for
sex difference in PM2.5 neurotoxicity in children. Moreover, brain development is also shaped by family- and
community-level social factors, but whether and how air pollution neurotoxicity interacts with the social context
remains unclear. This application will leverage the nationwide longitudinal
Development (ABCD) study of 9- and 10-year-olds (N=11,873)
Adolescent Brain Cognitive
to examine prenatal and childhood air pollution
exposure effects on neurobehavioral development in boys and girls across 21 U.S. cities. ABCD outcome
measures are anchored on the transition to early adolescence because neuromaturation continues from
childhood through early adulthood, making such developmental transition periods potentially more vulnerable to
environmental insults. Our primary exposure of interest is PM2.5, but advances in well-validated spatiotemporal
modeling tools will also allow us to explore neurotoxicity of PM composition and other gaseous pollutants (i.e.
NO2, O3). Given the reconstructed exposure histories from gestation to childhood to early-adolescence, we will:
(a) determine long-term cumulative exposure effects; and (b) examine differential exposure effects across
sensitive time windows to better define PM2.5 neurotoxicity on executive functioning (EF) and emotional
behaviors from ages 9 to 12 years-old (Aim 1); and also understand how the resulting neurotoxicity influences
structural and functional brain development, including brain morphology, white matter microstructure, brain
activity at rest and during EF and emotion-focused tasks, and functional connectivity of large-scale networks
(Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will evaluate if children are more susceptible to PM2.5 effects based on: a) sex and SES;
and b) family- and neighborhood-level contextual risk and protective factors. This application will advance our
understanding of air pollution neurotoxicity on adolescent brains, as well as how exposure effects may vary
across sensitive time windows of development and/or differ by individual susceptibility. The resulting new
knowledge will contribute to sciences-based air pollution regulations to protect public health, but also inform the
development of preventions and interventions targeting sensitive time-windows and vulnerable populations."
10871901,"The overarching goal of our laboratory is to determine how DNA damage response inhibitors (DDRi) can be used
to potentiate cancer cell killing while concurrently increasing anti-tumor immune responses after radiation therapy
(XRT). The DNA Damage Response (DDR) is a signaling system that integrates DNA repair pathways and the
cell cycle to safeguard genome stability. In addition to activating cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair in cells
treated with XRT, the DDR limits origin firing and delays cell cycle transitions in unstressed cells. While cyclin-
dependent kinases are cell cycle accelerators, DDR kinases are cell cycle brakes and, in this analogy, DDRi
disable the brakes, causing unchecked acceleration. Here we will determine how the DDR is rewired in CD8+ T
cells to accommodate massive and concomitant DNA replication and transcription in S phase. We will also
determine the impact of DDRi in cancer and immune cells. We hypothesize that ATR kinase inhibitors induce
origin firing that causes ribonucleosides to be mis-incorporated into the genome, and that this generates chimeric
RNA-DNA fragments and type I IFN-dependent immunologic memory after XRT. To test our hypothesis in cancer
and immune cells, we have generated an innovative transplantable model of cancer. The Mcm4Chaos3/Chaos3
mouse carries a mutation in Mcm4 that destabilizes the replicative helicase. Cells derived from Mcm4Chaos3/Chaos3
mice have a 60% reduction in origin licensing. We have generated Mcm4Chaos3/Chaos3 B16 cancer cells that can
be transplanted into Mcm4wt/wt and Mcm4Chaos3/Chaos3 mice. This will allow us to separate the function of ATR that
limits origin firing from that which mediates the repair of replication forks in cancer and immune cells. In Aim 1,
we will define cell cycle kinetics and determine how ATR inhibitors induce DNA damage in immune and cancer
cells in vitro. In Aim 2, we will define cell cycle kinetics and determine whether ATR inhibitors induce DNA
damage in immune cells and type 1 interferons in vivo. In Aim 3, we will determine whether ATR inhibitors
combine with XRT to generate durable responses and immunologic memory through effects on immune and/or
cancer cells. Successful completion of this project will define how the DDR is rewired in CD8+ T cells to
accelerate cell cycle transitions and accommodate massive and concomitant DNA replication and transcription
in S phase which, accounts for ~70% of the cell cycle as G1 is abridged. These studies are highly significant as
the objective of checkpoint blockade and adoptive T cell transfer is to induce rapid division in CD8+ T cells.
Successful completion of this project will identify combinations and sequences of DDRi that potentiate cancer
cell killing while concurrently increasing anti-tumor immune responses in mouse models of cancer treated with
XRT. These studies are highly significant as we use DDRi that are currently in 115 clinical trials and XRT which
is used to treat >50% of cancer patients, >60% with curative intent."
10871902,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Natural products (NPs) and their derivatives are one of our main sources of therapeutics, due to the millennia
these compounds have had to evolve interactions with their biological targets. However, the discovery of novel
NPs from traditional sources has waned in recent decades, while at the same time we are facing mounting
threats to human health such as increased antibiotic resistance. We therefore need new sources of NPs. One
underexplored source of NPs is methylotrophs; bacteria that grow on reduced carbon compounds lacking
carbon-carbon bonds such as methane gas. These organisms were overlooked during past NP discovery efforts
due to their growth requirements, but genomic analysis demonstrates that they have significant potential to make
novel NP scaffolds. I have been working with methylotrophs for close to a decade during my postdoctoral and
independent research, and during that time I have developed genetic and metabolomic tools for these organisms.
We are now ready to apply these tools to discover new methylotroph NPs with therapeutic value, as well as new
enzymatic transformations that are involved in NP biosynthesis. Our research program is divided into two main
directions. First, we will use our collection of ~100 unique bacterial strains isolated from methane enrichments
to discover new therapeutically relevant leads. We are constructing a fraction library from this strain collection
for use in bioactivity-based screens for antibiotic and anticancer compounds. Based on our findings, we will
prioritize hits and perform advanced testing on these compounds with the help of our collaborators and
supporting core centers. Because these strains almost all have sequenced genomes, we are also using similarity
networking approaches and our genetic tools to identify and activate biosynthetic gene clusters that are likely to
produce novel NPs. In our second research direction, we are capitalizing on our lab’s recently reported inverse
stable isotopic labeling approach to identify methylotroph NPs that incorporate a known precursor. With this
approach we will discover new NP scaffolds and associated novel biochemical transformations, and characterize
these transformations both in vitro as well as in vivo in the native NP producing organisms. For both research
directions, we have significant preliminary results that serve as examples of the types of projects that are
developing within our research program. This work will identify new therapeutic leads with antibiotic and
anticancer potential, and will also vet methods for prioritizing and activating the production of NPs from these
underexplored bacteria. It will also address knowledge gaps in the biosynthesis of important NP classes
(ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides as well as enediynes), and characterize new
enzymatic transformations that can be used as biocatalysts in medicinal chemistry efforts."
10871820,"There is an increasing dependence on sophisticated biomarker development to allow prediction of
therapeutic response as well as detection of potential underlying drug targets for novel therapeutics. A frequent
limitation for solid tumors is that standard tissue biopsies are not always feasible, safe or easily repeated during
treatment. Optimal sample acquisition, processing, and final validation are critical for any biomarker, regardless
of source. Moreover, with the advent of immunotherapy, repeated sampling has become even more critical
to understand the tumor and systemic immune response to better predict response and prevent resistance.
Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop reliable and valid alternatives to tissue biopsies. Peripheral
blood is easy and safe to obtain and is more readily obtainable before, during, and after treatment. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) can be isolated from standard whole blood and subsequent isolation and
analysis of protein, DNA and RNA has the potential to serve as a surrogate for tissue response to anti-cancer
therapy. However, analysis of immune functions more reflective of the systemic and tumor immune response to
immunotherapy, using PBMCs, requires unusually rigorous processing techniques. We have found, for
example, that reproducible viability of fresh samples is important for functional responses including cellular
cytotoxicity and chemotaxis. However, fresh processing with subsequent analysis often requires flexible staffing
and constant instrumentation availability due the unpredictable timing of patient sample collection. Furthermore,
requiring immediate analysis may preclude the benefits of batching samples. The central hypothesis of this
proposal is that optimizing PBMC processing will allow for delayed and more comprehensive, reproducible
functional analyses that reflect the patient immune and tumor status permitting clinical treatment decisions
without the requirement of a tissue biopsy.
 The hypothesis will be tested by first determining the optimal collection, processing and storage
conditions that maximize long-term viability and sustain intact downstream meaningful functional immune
analyses even when performed in a delayed batch manner. Second, we will determine if the reproducible PBMC
functional outcomes serve as a surrogates to tumor infiltrating immune cell function and therapeutic efficacy.
 This approach will allow the advancement of peripheral blood biospecimens to reflect underlying
mechanisms of tumor behavior previously relegated to the invasive tissue biopsy. In addition, we will have
established conditions for processing PBMCs that allow for reproducible collection of viable cells that maintain
functional capacity upon storage, from which meaningful functional assays can be performed by different
facilities. The fundamental knowledge obtained from this proposal will facilitate the development of suitable
correlative PBMC analyses for future clinical trials allowing for an easily obtained patient specimen that can
determine treatment and clinical responses in real time to immunotherapy and other anti-cancer therapy."
10871821,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder
(9.4% prevalence in children; 4.4% in adults) and is polygenic. A novel gene associated with ADHD is
Latrophilin-3 found in striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and amygdala. In humans,
there are 21 variants of LPHN3 associated with ADHD. Some pesticides may interact with ADHD genetic risk
factors to trigger or exacerbate the symptoms. We found that the common pyrethroid, deltamethrin (DLM),
administered prior to weaning in rats causes long-term behavioral, neurochemical, and electrophysiological
effects. We developed the first KO rats of Lphn3. Lphn3 KO rats are hyperactive, hyper-reactive to startle
stimuli, and cognitively impaired. This PAR-19-386 “Environmental Risks for Psychiatric Disorders: Biological
Basis of Pathophysiology” seeks models that will elucidate Gene x Environment interactions related to
neuropsychiatric disorders, such as ADHD. We hypothesize that Lphn3-/- and Lphn3+/- rats will interact with
DLM (Type II pyrethroid) or permethrin (PRM, Type I pyrethroid) to exacerbate an ADHD-like phenotype.
Specific Aim 1: Determine the effects of DLM in Lphn3-/-, Lphn3+/-, and wildtype (WT) rats on activity,
reactivity, learning and memory (L&M), dopamine (DA) and NMDA markers, and apoptosis. Aim-1a: Compare
WT rats with Lphn3-/- and Lphn3+/- rats administered 0, 0.5, or 2.0 mg/kg DLM from P3-20 for changes in
activity, acoustic and tactile startle (including prepulse inhibition (PPI)) egocentric, allocentric, and working
L&M, and for changes in DA and NMDA-R markers in various brain regions, including markers for programmed
cell death. Aim-1b, neurochemical outcomes in rats not behaviorally tested. Specific Aim 2: Determine the
effects of PRM in Lphn3-/-, Lphn3+/- rats vs. WT rats on the outcomes used in Aim-1. Aim-2a: Same as Aim-1a
with PRM. Aim-2b: Same as Aim-1b with PRM. Specific Aim 3: Determine the effects of DLM in adult Lphn3-
/-, Lphn3+/- rats vs. WT rats. Aim-3a: same outcomes as in Aim-1a. Adults with ADHD are an understudied
and a population susceptible for higher exposure to pyrethroids from occupational exposure, making Aims 3
and 4 important. Aim-3b: Same as Aim-1b in adult rats. Specific Aim 4: Determine the effects of PRM in
adult Lphn3-/-, Lphn3+/- rats vs. WT rats. Aim-4a: Same outcomes used in Aim-1a. Aim-4b: Same as Aim-1b
in adult rats not behaviorally tested. Impact: ADHD interferes with normal development, costs billions to treat
and manage, yet we know little about environmental contributions to those with ADHD. Insecticides are
suspected in ADHD but such interactions between gene and environment are not established. Lphn3-/- and
Lphn3+/- rats represent a novel approach to probing the effects of exposure to pyrethroids using a known
ADHD genetic susceptibility. The model will shed new light on how a gene known to be associated with ADHD
affects the behavioral and biochemical effects of prototypical pyrethroids. Interaction data can be used for risk
assessment and help provide safeguards against pyrethroid exposure for those with ADHD."
10871822,"Design of genetically encoded sensors for detecting endogenous opioid peptides
 Opioids that target the mu-opioid receptors (MOR) remain the most effective pain medication but
with severe side effects, such as addiction, constipation and respiratory suppression. The side effects
result from a lack of specificity for the MOR in the pain modulation circuit by currently available opioids.
Since endogenous opioid peptides do not lead to such adverse effects, understanding their role in different
neuronal circuits could advance our knowledge of how opioid peptides act differently, and possibly facilitate
the design of novel pain medications with reduced side effects. To study how endogenous opioid peptides
exert their effects on different neural circuits, we need to detect when and where the endogenous opioid
peptides are released in the brain at a high spatiotemporal resolution and at the circuit level. Microdialysis,
the best available method for detecting opioid peptides in the mouse brain, can detect opioid peptides with
a spatial resolution of ~ 400 µm and a temporal resolution of ~20 minutes. However, neuron somas are ~
20 µm and neuromodulating peptides are usually released and function on the order of seconds to minutes.
There is a need of methods to detect the endogenous opioid peptide release with higher spatiotemporal
resolution. Therefore, we propose to design two classes of opioid sensors: 1) A transcriptional reporter
that will enable the detection of the endogenous opioid peptides at a cellular resolution across a large
volume of the brain tissue for studying how endogenous opioid peptides exert their effects at the circuit
level; 2) Real time fluorescent sensors that will enable the detection of the endogenous opioid peptides
with subcellular spatial resolution and a temporal resolution on the order of seconds. These two sensors
will complement each other to address the long unanswered questions regarding the endogenous opioid
peptide regulation and signaling. For example, what kind of pain and reward stimuli will stimulate the opioid
peptide release? Where exactly are the opioid peptides released at a cellular or sub-cellular resolution in
response to different pain and reward stimuli? How soon after pain or reward stimuli are endogenous opioid
peptides released? Completion of this proposal will contribute to our long-term goal of designing tools to
advance our understanding of the endogenous opioid signaling for designing pain medications with mini-
mum side effects."
10871903,"Project Summary — Translational regulation has emerged as a key process in the evolution of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC)1,11. Support of rapid proliferation in cancer requires enhanced protein production as well as
gene-specific translational changes that facilitate reprogrammed cellular activities. Recent research has revealed
that ribosome composition, including rRNA modification stoichiometry, can affect translational function in cells
and bias translation of oncogenic transcripts, altering cell state6,17–20. Although 2% of all rRNA bases are
modified, only two of them are N6-methyladenosine (m6A) — 28S m6A4220 and 18S m6A1832. Our lab previously
characterized the 28S m6A4220 methyltransferase (ZCCHC4)21, and we have now biochemically characterized
METTL5 (M5) as the 18S m6A1832 methyltransferase, stabilized by the cofactor TRMT112. The function of this
site is still unknown, but structural analysis suggests roles in translation initiation and re-initiation events29,31, as
it is near the mRNA channel and at the binding site of ribosome recycling factors. Furthermore, our M5 knockout
HeLa cells display a markedly hypoproliferative phenotype while overexpression of M5 has been associated with
hyperproliferation, including in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)8,9,22. We have also shown by imaging and
biochemical fractionation that M5 is localized in both the nucleolus and cytosol, suggesting that the 18S m6A site
may be dynamically methylated in the cytosol, even after ribosome biogenesis, to regulate and/or fine tune
translational processes. The goal of this proposal is to define the functional effects of M5 on translation and
investigate the mechanism by which it supports cell proliferation and cancer development. We hypothesize that
M5 dynamically methylates m6A1832 in response to oncogenic cell stress with functional consequences in
ribosome composition, translational function, and ribosome recycling activities that support proliferation and
tumorigenesis. To investigate this hypothesis, we will first thoroughly define the impact of M5 on ribosome
composition and function as follows: quantifying M5 and m6A1832 under normal and stress conditions by LC-
MS/MS and HPLC; characterizing the effect of M5 on translation through nascent protein synthesis assays,
ribosome profiling, and translation reporter assays; and monitoring M5-related changes in stoichiometry of
ribosomal proteins and translation-related factors. Then, we will investigate the role and mechanism of M5 in
HCC proliferation and tumorigenesis by examining the effects of M5 on ribosome binding and translational
activities of ribosome recycling factors, and by evaluating the role of M5 in proliferation of HCC cell lines and
tumorigenesis in HCC xenograft mouse models with respect to ribosome recycling processes. Successful
completion of this proposal will unveil the function of 18S m6A1832 in translation, clarify the link between M5 and
HCC prognosis, potentially guide new translation-based therapy development for HCC, and contribute to our
understanding of how dynamic regulation of rRNA modifications can affect the proteome and cellular state in
support of cancer development."
10871904,"Summary
I am an oncologist and cancer biologist supervising a laboratory focused on identifying therapies that
selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells. My initial contributions to the apoptosis field came with separating
certain pro-death BCL-2 family BH3-only proteins into “sensitizers” and “activators” based on pro-apoptotic
function. This finding drove my interest in the possibilities of inhibiting BCL-2 function with drugs that mimicked
the BH3 domain of pro-apoptotic proteins. I designed the first mouse model that demonstrated that loss of
BCL-2 function by itself could be sufficient to drive a cancer into remission. Following this, I designed a tool
called BH3 profiling – exposing mitochondria to synthetic oligo-peptides based on the amphipathic alpha-
helical BH3 domains of proapoptotic proteins and measuring mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
(MOMP). By using certain selectively-interacting BH3 peptides, I could use BH3 profiling to identify cells that
were especially sensitive to BH3 inhibition. I used BH3 profiling to help launch clinical trial programs of the
BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax in several diseases. Most successful among these so far have been programs in
chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia, the former of which has already yielded FDA
approvals.
Using different BH3 peptides, BH3 profiling can measure overall apoptotic priming, or proximity to the threshold
of apoptosis. We used this aspect to demonstrate that differential apoptotic priming is perhaps the most
significant determinant of successful chemotherapy treatment. Moreover, differential apoptotic priming is the
main reason that there is a therapeutic index for conventional chemotherapy – most non-malignant somatic
cells are far less primed for apoptosis than chemosensitive cancer cells. Building on this finding, we asked
whether we could identify drugs that could enhance apoptotic priming selectively in cancer cells. We found
that we could measure increased apoptotic priming within hours of exposing cancer cells to effective drugs
using dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP). Increased priming is measured as increased sensitivity of mitochondria in
treated cells to BH3 peptides compared to untreated controls. Over the past few years, we have found that an
increased priming by a drug in DBP is an excellent predictor of in vivo activity in human and mouse models, in
solid and liquid tumors. An important advantage of DBP over most other ex vivo drug sensitivity strategies is
that DBP requires no more than 24 hours of ex vivo culture. This overcomes the major obstacle to the general
application of such strategies, since many cancers cannot adapt to long-term ex vivo culture, and if they do,
they are phenotypically altered so as to degrade the information they can provide. We are exploring DBP as a
discovery tool and predictive biomarker in many liquid and solid tumors. Moreover, we are using it as a tool to
identify drugs that can make target tumor cells more sensitive to immuno-oncology therapies."
10871905,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a lethal cancer with poor outcomes (5 year survival <20%), when
diagnosed after the onset of symptoms, but survival is excellent when diagnosed early. Intestinal metaplasia,
or Barrett’s esophagus (BE), is the only known precursor of EAC, and progresses to EAC via development of
dysplasia. EAC can be prevented by endoscopic therapy of dysplasia. Hence endoscopic screening for BE and
endoscopic surveillance to detect dysplasia and EAC are recommended. However, > 60% of prevalent BE
remains undiagnosed and 90% of all EAC cases are diagnosed outside a BE surveillance program. The major
barrier to BE screening is the invasiveness and high cost of endoscopy. Further, screening is recommended
only in those with chronic gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), despite 50% of BE/EAC patients not reporting
GERD symptoms. Endoscopic surveillance misses 33% of prevalent EAC & dysplasia, due to the patchy
distribution of dysplasia/EAC, and inadequate biopsy sampling. Hence the overall effectiveness of endoscopic
surveillance is also severely compromised.
We used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) to identify a panel of methylated DNA markers
(MDMs) of BE and dysplasia/EAC followed by validation. MDM panels were highly discriminant (AUCs > 0.9)
for BE and prevalent dysplasia/EAC. When assayed on esophageal cytology specimens obtained via a sponge
on string (SOS) device, BE was detected with high accuracy (AUCs 0.97-1.0) in two case control studies done
in referral populations. The FDA approved SOS device (Capnostics, Doylestown, PA) is a 25 mm polyurethane
sponge compressed in a dissolvable capsule shell, which expands into a sphere in the stomach after being
swallowed. When pulled out through the mouth via an attached string, sampling of the entire esophageal
mucosa is achieved. The nurse-administered SOS test is safe and well tolerated with high participation rates
(65%). Hence our central hypothesis is that novel discriminant MDMs assayed on esophageal cytology
specimens obtained via the SOS device will enable accurate BE and dysplasia/EAC detection, in a screening
population with and without chronic GERD. We will test this hypothesis by three specific aims.
In specific Aim 1, we will measure the positive and negative predictive value of the SOS BE test in a screening
eligible population from primary care clinics in the Mayo Health System and compare these values in those
with and without GERD. In specific Aim 2 we will identify clinical and demographic factors, particularly GERD,
influencing the accuracy a predetermined SOS BE test prediction algorithm. In Specific Aim 3, we will measure
the accuracy of MDMs for the detection of dysplasia/EAC in BE, using the SOS device.
Utilizing an innovative, minimally invasive (non-endoscopic) and molecular approach, this proposal will
favorably impact BE detection and surveillance, enabling effective treatment, and improved EAC outcomes."
10870311,"Project description
Gut epithelium is the principal site in which neural, immune, microbial and dietary factors interact.
These multi-system interactions critically regulate whole-body physiology including metabolism,
immunity, and neurodegenerative diseases. Gut epithelium is exposed to a myriad of mechanical
forces that are generated by gut peristalsis and food passing. These forces include shear stress,
stretch, and compression. Despite growing interest in mechanobiology, mechanisms of gut
mechanosensing and its effects on physiology and diseases remain largely unexplored. In this
project, we explore the impact of gut mechanosensing on metabolism and aging-related dysplasia.
The adult Drosophila midgut has emerged as a simple but robust genetic model system for
investigation of gut growth and physiology. We have recently begun to elucidate the cellular and
molecular mechanisms of gut mechanosensing by showing that shear stress could activate
enteroendocrine cells through the transient receptor potential A1 (TrpA1) ion channel. Moreover,
disruption of TrpA1-mediated gut mechanosensing could significantly impact intestine stem cell
proliferation. In our pilot study, we have made novel and exciting findings that many gut
metabolites including lipids are altered in TrpA1 mutants. In this collaborative project, we will
synergize our expertise on gut mechanobiolgy and state-of-the-art metabolomic analysis, and
combine it with the power of Drosophila genetics, to determine the impact of gut mechanosensing
on systemic metabolism in intact tissues. We also propose to define the signaling mechanisms
that link gut mechanosensing to aging-related dysplasia. Completion of this project will provide a
conceptual advance of how gut mechanosensing could play a role in metabolism and aging. Given
that each cell type in the Drosophila gut epithelium has conserved functions with its mammalian
counterpart, we further expect that our results could provide some insights on gut mechanobiology
in mammals."
10870378,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Our lab in collaboration with Akkadian Therapeutics, Inc. (AKTX), have demonstrated
the beneficial effects of the novel catalytic radical scavenger and nitric oxide donor/vasodilator, AKT-1005, in
established in vitro and in vivo models of preeclampsia. However, the development of AKT-1005 itself as a drug
candidate is limited by poor water solubility, instability and sub-optimal pharmacokinetic (PK)
characteristics. To circumvent these issues, we proposes to synthesize, screen and test water-soluble prodrugs
of AKT-1005 for solubility, stability, and release of AKT-1005 in vitro and in vivo, in order to select candidates
for in vivo efficacy studies using an established rodent model of preeclampsia.
Preeclampsia (PE) is a serious life-threatening complication during pregnancy, characterized by high
maternal blood pressure, kidney dysfunction, proteinuria, and in severe cases, eclampsia and premature birth.
It affects around 5% of pregnancies. While the etiology and pathogenesis of PE are elusive, placental ischemia/
hypoxia due to impaired placental development and subsequent release of anti-angiogenic factors (sFlt1 and
sEng) are key components There is also compelling evidence for the involvement of oxidative stress,
and concurrent mitochondrial alterations in PE.
AKT-1005, is a novel cell-permeable redox-active agent incorporating two chemical active moieties: 1) an
organic nitrate that releases nitric oxide in vivo, and 2) a pyrrolidine nitroxide that acts as a degradation catalyst
of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We propose that these dual actions of AKT-1005 will (i) efficiently remove ROS
responsible for the deleterious effects of oxidative stress in PE, (ii) reduce maternal blood pressure by the direct
vasodilator effect of NO on blood vessel walls, and (iii) increase the bioavailability of NO, which is deficient in
PE, but not other deleterious reactive nitrogen species (RNS, a side-reaction of NO with ROS).
For selected prodrugs, systemic PK of parent prodrug, AKT-1005 and the major metabolite, HMP, will be
determined in rodents following IV and IP dosing to the efficacy species (mouse) at doses found efficacious for
AKT-1005 in previous studies. Cross-species metabolic comparisons for preferred prodrug(s) using isolated liver
microsomes from mouse, rat, dog or human will also be performed.
Selected prodrugs with the best attributes from the above will then be compared to AKT-1005 in an
established/published murine model of PE. Time-pregnant mice will be subjected to adenovirus-sFLT1
(AdsFLT1), which reliably induces the main features of PE, and treated with prodrug or vehicle control 3 days
later. Mice will be evaluated for blood pressure, renal function, histologic damage, 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) tissue
immunoreactivity, plasma biomarkers (oxidative/nitrosative stress, sFlt-1 and VEGF, and pregnancy outcomes,
etc.) The proposed studies will provide a rational foundation for advancement of an AKT-1005 prodrug,
through lead optimization, to clinical candidate as a first-line early intervention in high-risk PE pregnancies."
10870379,"ABSTRACT
Urothelial bladder cancer represents a significant global public health burden, accounting for some 200,000
deaths each year. Among the many environmental risk factors for bladder cancer, drinking water contaminated
by inorganic arsenic (iAS) represents a common cause, especially among rural populations. This mechanism
appears especially relevant here in the rural state of New Hampshire, which suffers from the single highest
incidence of bladder cancer among the fifty states. Despite longstanding knowledge that iAs exposure represents
a highly preventable cause of bladder cancer, the precise mechanism by which iAs increases bladder cancer
risk remains uncertain, leading to an absence of post-exposure risk mitigation strategies. To address this issue,
we now propose to develop an entirely novel zebrafish model of urinary bladder cancer, allowing us to leverage
the many advantages of the zebrafish model organism including facile gene targeting and a long history of
productive use in environmental toxicology research. Our group has recently demonstrated that adult zebrafish
harbor a mammalian-like contractile urinary bladder, with single cell (sc) RNA-Seq identifying both basal and
luminal urothelial cell types similar to those observed in mouse and human. Based on these findings, we now
propose to test the following central hypotheses: First, that urothelial-specific oncogene activation combined
with tp53, kdm6a and stag2 inactivation will induce zebrafish urothelial neoplasia; second, that arsenic exposure
will alter the transcriptional landscape and cell composition of zebrafish bladder; and third, that a combination of
oncogenic stimuli and arsenic exposure will accelerate these changes in both pre-malignant and neoplastic
zebrafish urothelium. To test these hypotheses, the following Specific Aims will be pursued: 1) To examine the
ability of urothelial-specific oncogene activation and tumor suppressor gene inactivation to induce neoplastic
transformation in zebrafish urinary bladder; and 2) To determine the effects of iAs on transcriptional landscapes
and cell composition in normal, pre-neoplastic and/or neoplastic zebrafish urinary bladder. These studies will
be enabled by our broadly inter-disciplinary, multi-institutional research team comprised of experts in zebrafish
cancer modeling (Leach), bladder cancer molecular genetics (Real) and arsenic toxicology and single cell
transcriptional profiling (Goodale), allowing us to pursue a variety of highly innovative strategies. Together, the
studies proposed in this R21 application will determine the effects of combined oncogene activation and tumor
suppressor gene inactivation in zebrafish urothelium, potentially leading to a valuable new zebrafish model of
urinary bladder cancer. In addition, these studies will provide the very first glimpse of how inorganic arsenic alters
the transcriptional landscape of urothelial and non-urothelial cells in vivo and at single cell resolution, informing
future strategies for the effective prevention of arsenic-induced bladder cancer."
10869048,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Psychiatric disorders pose intricate challenges to individuals’ well-being, with their underlying
molecular causes and pathophysiological mechanisms remaining elusive. Genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) have provided valuable insights into the genetic associations of
psychiatric disorders. However, translating these associations into specific causal driver variants
and genes to unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms remains a significant challenge.
Recent advancements in genetic-based imputation have enabled the inference of genetically-
regulated components of trascriptomics from genome-wide genotype data. Our research team
has successfully utilized brain-specific transcriptomic imputation approaches across psychiatric
disorders to identify novel genes and pathways associated with risk. Here, we aim to further
enhance our understanding of psychiatric disorders by performing transcriptome-wide
association studies (TWAS) on circular RNAs (circRNA) transcriptomics. CircRNAs are formed
through back splicing and exhibit functional importance. Their unique circular structure and
enhanced stability make them intriguing candidates for studying gene expression regulation in
physiological and pathological conditions. However, their involvement in psychiatric disorders is
understudied and their integration with GWAS studies remains unexplored. In Aim 1, we will
construct genetically regulated circRNA expression models using RNAseq ribo-depleted
libraries of postmortem brain tissues, encompassing diverse ancestries and multiple brain
regions. In Aim 2, we will integrate GWAS data with circRNA expression profiles using TWAS to
identify disease-relevant genes and pathways influenced by circRNA dysregulation. This
integrative approach will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying
psychiatric disorders and provide valuable insights into the functional implications of circRNA
dysregulation. Ultimately, this research has the potential to transform our understanding of the
molecular basis of psychiatric disorders and pave the way for precision medicine strategies in
psychiatric care."
10871250,"Adenomyosis is a common, understudied, estrogen-dependent uterine disorder that greatly impacts the well-
being of women. It is characterized by endometrial cells in the myometrium that elicit inflammation and smooth
muscle hyperplasia and hypertrophy, and symptoms of severe dysmenorrhea and heavy menstrual bleeding
(HMB), subfertility, and poor pregnancy outcomes. The disease is believed to derive from physiologic
(pregnancy) or iatrogenic (uterine surgery, endometrial curettage) trauma to the endometrial-myometrial
junction (EMJ), with local inflammation promoting migration of endometrial basalis into the myometrium.
Therapies include suppressing estrogen production and action, but long-term efficacy and acceptability of these
are limited, and disease excision is complicated, and while hysterectomy is curative, it is unacceptable in
patients trying to conceive. The goal of this proposal is to gain insights into adenomyosis pathophysiology at
single cell resolution, leading to novel and targeted medical therapies to abate symptoms and improve quality
of life of those affected. Our recent bulk RNAseq of endometrial and sub-endometrial inner myometrial
specimens from patients with diffuse adenomyosis vs controls support collective endometrial cell migration and
reveal marked endometrial inflammation, and myometrial neuroactive ligand-receptor and cytokine-receptor
interactions. In preliminary studies, we developed and applied a bioinformatic drug discovery pipeline to these
data and identified novel and known compounds of interest (COI) that reverse disease networks in silico. We
hypothesize that unique features in the EMJ give rise to adenomyosis and its symptoms, and that EMJ
homeostasis can be restored using novel or re-purposed drugs discovered by expression reversal of disease
networks. In Aim 1, we will create an EMJ compartment-specific single cell transcriptomic atlas from 40 well-
annotated samples from uteri with and without diffuse adenomyosis across the menstrual cycle, archived in our
Human Uterine Research Biorepository and with ongoing prospective accrual as needed. In Aim 2, we will
apply a transcriptomics based drug repurposing pipeline to publicly available and newly generated uterine
transcriptome datasets to identify COI to reverse the adenomyosis phenotype. Our multidisciplinary,
collaborative team has vast expertise in uterine disorders, omics technologies, molecular and cell biology,
immunology, and computational sciences. The impact of our proposal, using advanced technologies and high
order analytics, is to elucidate cellular dysfunction of EMJ endometrium and inner myometrium at single cell
resolution in adenomyosis patients and discover drugs for specific cell type targets for future studies for disease
regression and symptom abatement."
10864381,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ovarian cancer is among the five leading causes of cancer death in the US with estimated 20,000 new cases
and more than 13,000 deaths in 2023. High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common and
deadly subtype and accounts for ~75% of ovarian cancer deaths. Amplification and overexpression of CCNE1,
the gene encoding cyclin E1, leads to hyperactivation of the cognate kinase CDK2 and occurs in ~50% of
HGSOC patients. Dysregulated CCNE1 expression is also frequently observed in aggressive subtypes of
endometrial cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. In ovarian cancer. CCNE1 amplification is associated with
poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy, and most patients with advanced HGSOC (>80%) experience
recurrence and ultimately succumb to their disease. The paucity of therapeutic options for CCNE1-driven tumors
makes the development of novel drugs that counteract this aberration a critical unmet need.
 CDK2 is a validated drug target, and studies by many laboratories in academia and the pharmaceutical
industry have shown that targeting CDK2 is a viable and perhaps ideal approach to combat cancers
characterized by CCNE1 amplification. However, conventional ATP-site (type I) inhibitors have largely failed in
the clinic due to insufficient selectivity, particularly off target inhibition of the closely related and common essential
kinase CDK1. We have previously identified an allosteric site unique to CDK2 and demonstrated that small
molecule ligands occupying this site stabilize a CDK2 conformational state that is less favorable for interaction
with cyclins. While such monovalent allosteric (type III) ligands lack the high binding affinity required to effectively
disrupt the interaction of CDK2 with cyclin E1, our recent structural and computational studies provide strong
evidence that joining an allosteric ligand with a high-affinity ATP-site (type I) inhibitor presents a new means to
suppress the hyperactivation of CDK2 caused by elevated cyclin E1 levels. The overall objective of this project
is to develop first-in-class bifunctional allosteric inhibitors that stabilize CDK2 in a conformational state
incompatible with cyclin E1 binding. We hypothesize that such inhibitors potently and selectively disrupt the
CDK2-cyclin E1 complex, thereby counteracting the oncogenic activity of elevated CCNE1 expression. The
rationale underlying this research is that it will provide general insights into the feasibility of bivalent allosteric
CDK2 inhibitors in the context of CCNE1-driven cancers and build a strong scientific framework whereby new
therapeutic strategies can be developed."
10864635,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Endometriosis is a painful gynecological inflammatory disease that affects up to 15% of people born with a
uterus. While effective for a fraction of patients, current therapies such as hormones and NSAIDs present several
side effects. Therefore, new medical therapies and targets that provide long-term benefit are still needed. Here,
we propose to validate drugs that block neuroimmune communication as well as macrophage-targeting drugs
as novel, non-hormonal, and non-opioid approaches for the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain. The
project also addresses a previous unknown mechanism by which CGRP contributes to a pro-endometriosis
phenotype in macrophages and pinpoints a nociceptor-responsive macrophage population that drives omental
colonization for subsequent pain and lesion formation in endometriosis. My preliminary data show that nociceptor
to macrophage signaling via CGRP/RAMP1 contributes lesion formation and endometrial cell growth. However,
the mechanisms by which CGRP programs (re)macrophages to a pro-endometriosis phenotype is not known.
Therefore, we will (Aim 1) identify the inflammatory mediators released and the signaling pathways activated in
macrophages upon CGRP stimulation using bulk RNAseq analysis. I will further use FDA approved drugs such
as pexidartinib to the measure the effect of macrophage-targeting in my mouse model. I also have preliminary
data showing that Maresin-1 (MaR1) a pro-resolving lipid mediator reduces pain and stimulates efferocytosis by
macrophages. I will next determine the mechanisms by which MaR1 resolves pain and inflammation in
endometriosis. For that, I will perform scRNAseq of MaR1-treated mice at different timepoints to understand the
dynamics and mechanism of pain resolution during endometriosis.
I also have preliminary scRNAseq data showing that endometriosis completely changes the immune cell
landscape in the peritoneal cavity with a decrease in the macrophages that migrate to the omentum. Therefore,
during my R00 phase (Aim 2) I will determine the extent to which neuroimmune communication drives omental
colonization by macrophages as well as pinpoint the nociceptor-responsive population of macrophages in the
omentum that is responsible for endometriosis pain and lesion formation. I will then use transgenic mice to
deplete that macrophage population to determine the extent to which those cells contribute to pain and lesion
formation. To reach these long-term goals, I have outlined a detailed career development plan, which will provide
me with the technical and leadership skills to establish a successful research laboratory. The K99 phase of
research will be conducted under the excellent co-mentorship of Drs. Michael Rogers and Clifford Woolf. My
Research Advisory Committee and collaborator are leading experts in neuroimmune communication (Dr. Chiu),
endometriosis (Dr. Missmer), and pharmacology of pain and neuroimmune communication (Dr. Cunha). This
K99/R00 award will provide me key support for my successful transition to an independent investigator studying
neuroimmune communication during endometriosis."
10867367,"Faculty who study the neuroscience of hearing and vocal communication at the University of Southern
California (USC) established a research training program for predoctoral, postdoctoral, and physician-scientist
scholars starting in 2009: the Hearing and Communication Neuroscience (HCN) Training Program. The
program brings together a broad spectrum of scientists to enhance inter-disciplinary communication, and offers
the advantage of providing research training opportunities that bridge basic science with translational research
and clinical applications. The program serves to reinforce research and training interactions between scientists
who study basic aspects of hearing and vocal communication in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts &
Sciences, the Keck School of Medicine, and the Viterbi School of Engineering at USC. The program combines
the strengths of an outstanding group of researchers, the resources of USC graduate programs in
Neuroscience, Development/Stem Cell/Regenerative Medicine, Psychology, and Linguistics, and expertise in
clinical otologic excellence provided by the Department of Otolaryngology. The rationale of this proposal is to
engage predoctoral, postdoctoral, and physician-scientist trainees in a highly interactive and multi-disciplinary
training experience ranging from cell biology to cognitive neuroscience and linguistics that is unfettered by
conventional departmental barriers, and to actively facilitate their development as independent scientists.
We have successfully filled positions with outstanding predoctoral and postdoctoral scholars during the first ten
years of the program. Predoctoral trainees typically join the program during the second year of their graduate
training, whereas the level of seniority of post-doctoral trainees participating in the program varies. All trainees
receive multi-disciplinary training in all aspects of hearing and communication neuroscience, as well as
practical skills that will prepare them for careers in independently-funded research, education, and industry.
The ability to expose trainees directly to both cutting-edge research in basic science as well as ongoing clinical
research and applications is a major strength of the program."

Many living organisms including humans have evolved mechanisms to sense and respond to levels of mineral
nutrients or amino acids. In this application, we propose to use Arabidopsis plant sulfur (S) nutrient sensing
and signaling as an experimental system to dissect transporting receptor-mediated nutrient sensing
mechanisms. Our prior research has led to identification of sulfate transporter SULTR1;2 as a receptor. This
type of dual-function transporting receptor, termed transceptor, has been increasingly found in eukaryotic
organisms and is expected to increase nutrient use efficiency by performing both its sensing and transporting
functions. However, how plants use the transceptor SULTR1;2 to transduce the S signal in the control of gene
expression has remained a central unanswered question and becomes the focus of the present project. Our
recent studies have revealed a conserved shortcut model of transcriptional control that links Rho family small
GTPases to RNA polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal domain (CTD) Ser phosphorylation across plants, fungi and
humans. The Pol II CTD contains various number of conserved heptad peptide repeats (Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7) in
which each amino acid can be subjected to different posttranslational modifications. Thus, the posttranslational
modification pattern is complex and collectively called the CTD code. Among the CTD code, Ser2 and Ser5
phosphorylation along the gene is very important for initiating transcription and completing the transcription
cycle. In the classical model of transcriptional control, upon activation by Rho or Ras GTPases, the MAP
kinase cascade activates transcription factors that bind to gene-specific cis-elements and helps recruit Pol II to
the core promoter. In contrast, in the shortcut model, Rho GTPase signaling directly targets the Pol II CTD
Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylation and thus can rapidly bring about large-scale gene expression changes. We
now have preliminary evidence indicating that activity of ROP2 GTPase, which is a member of plant-unique
ROP subfamily of Rho GTPases, and levels of CTD Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylation are impacted by S status.
In addition, ROP GTPase activity is higher in SULTR1;2 mutants. Therefore, we hypothesize that ROP2 and its
functionally redundant ROP4 act as negative regulators in SULTR1;2-mediated S sensing and signaling. The
proposed work aims to fill the major gaps from SULTR1;2 to Pol II transcription. Specifically, Aim 1 is to test
that ROP2 and ROP4 GTPases act as negative regulators in SULTR1;2-mediated S sensing and signaling
using genetic and biochemical approaches. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that ROP2-mediated Pol II shortcut
model is required for S response. In Aim 3, we propose to test that ROP2-controlled SLIM1 transcription factor
activity and ROP2-mediated Pol II CTD code modulation act cooperatively to achieve the most productive
transcription of S-deficiency induced S-response genes. The proposed study will not only lead to novel
mechanistic insights into how plants use nutrient transceptor SULTR1;2 and ROP signaling switch to efficiently
control gene expression but also provide a paradigm for transcriptional regulation in other organisms."

Deciphering how axons terminate growth and forms synapses is essential if we are to understand how a nervous
system is built. Such knowledge could provide opportunities to treat neurodevelopmental disorders and will be
needed if we are to harness the robust and resilient nature of the developing nervous system to design novel
therapies for treating neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Our long-term goal is to
understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern axon termination and synapse formation
in vivo using the nematode C. elegans.
 The Pam/Highwire/RPM-1 (PHR) proteins are ubiquitin ligases and signaling hubs that are important
conserved regulators of axon termination, synapse formation and axon degeneration. Emerging links between
PHR signaling and neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (including AD) have further
heightened interest in understanding PHR signaling networks. Here, we use the latest high-sensitivity mass
spectrometry technology; rapid automated protein extraction and purification; and novel ubiquitination ‘traps’ to
decipher the signaling network of the C. elegans PHR protein, RPM-1. This has revealed two putative RPM-1
ubiquitination substrates and provided numerous footholds for deciphering how RPM-1 is regulated.
 Our first aim focuses on an autophagy initiating kinase as a novel RPM-1 ubiquitination substrate.
CRISPR/Cas9 editing and genetics test if RPM-1 ubiquitin ligase activity affects the stability and turnover of this
kinase to influence axon and synapse development. We also evaluate how RPM-1 effects on this kinase affect
autophagosome formation in neurons. Outcomes will provide insight into whether PHR proteins regulate
autophagy, and address how autophagy is inhibited in the nervous system in vivo. Our interest in these questions
is further fueled by the prominent role autophagy plays in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD.
 Our second aim will evaluate another novel RPM-1 ubiquitination substrate, a kinase with prominent roles
in synapse development, synaptic plasticity and AD. We will determine how RPM-1 inhibits this kinase, and
whether this affects axon termination and synapse formation. We also aim to address which downstream
mechanisms this kinase utilizes to affect axon and synapse development. Despite the importance of this kinase
in nervous system health and disease, how it is inhibited remains unknown in any organism.
 Finally, proteomics provided several entry points into understanding how RPM-1 might be regulated. In our
third aim, we focus on three particularly compelling entry points. 1) The most prominent RPM-1 binding protein
identified. 2) Components of an entire receptor signaling system identified as RPM-1 binding proteins. 3)
Numerous residues in RPM-1 that are phosphorylated in vivo. We will evaluate how these mechanisms affect
RPM-1 localization, and RPM-1 functions in axon and synapse development. Our interest in these questions is
driven by a simple theme: How PHR proteins are regulated, in any system, remains dark biology."
