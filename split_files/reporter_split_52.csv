 This R01 proposal outlines a research plan which uses targeted nanomedicine to enhance disease-
modifying molecular mechanisms both in the acute injurious phase and in the subsequent chronic fibrotic
phase of viral-induced pneumonitis. The overall goal of this proposal is to use nanomedicine to modify specific
cellular subtypes during the lung disease process. Acute and chronic lung diseases are major causes of
mortality and morbidity in the US. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), caused by widespread
endothelial barrier disruption and uncontrolled cytokine storm, is the major cause of death in critically ill
influenza and COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, pulmonary fibrosis, progressive scarring in injured lung, is a
major sequelae of viral pneumonia. Early analyses showed that discharged COVID-19 patients are at high risk
for developing pulmonary fibrosis. Currently, there are few pharmacological treatments that directly targets
ARDS, and available therapeutic options for pulmonary fibrosis remain suboptimal, underscoring unmet
medical needs in a heightened state due to COVID-19 pandemic. Strongly supported by our published and
unpublished in vivo results, we believe that targeted nanomedicine approaches have tremendous potential to
treat ARDS and pulmonary fibrosis, which will be comprehensively tested in vivo in this application. Aim 1 will
test the therapeutic effectiveness of specifically reducing endothelial dysfunction in acute lung injury (influenza
or SARS-CoV-2) in mice and perfused human lungs using a VCAM1-targeting, KLF2 mRNA-encapsulated
nanoparticles. We anticipate that specific endothelial KLF2 overexpression will reduce acute lung injury. Aim 2
will test the therapeutic effectiveness of specifically targeting lung fibroblasts in chronic pulmonary fibrosis
(bleomycin) in mice and human lung slices using PDGFRB-targeting nanoparticles to deliver shRNAs against
TXNDC5. We anticipate that specific fibroblast inhibition of TXNDC5 will reduce lung fibrosis."

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs),
particularly current third generation mutation-selective agents such as osimertinib (AZD9291 or TAGRISSOTM),
has achieved great success and provided significant clinical benefit in patients with EGFR activating mutations.
However, the development of unavoidable acquired resistance has become the major obstacle to patients
achieving long-term remission. Hence, there is an urgent unmet need in the clinic for the development of
effective strategies to overcome acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs, particularly 3rd generation agents. The
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR) coactivator-1 (PGC1) functions as a coactivator to
coordinate the activity of transcription factors such as PPAR to modulate energy metabolism, lipid
metabolisms and other cellular processes. Both PGC1 and PPAR have been implicated in promoting
tumorigenesis and mediating chemoresistance. Our RNA-seq analysis revealed that the expression of both
PPARGC1B (that encodes PGC1) and PPARG (that encodes PPAR) genes were significantly decreased in
osimertinib-treated EGFR mutant NSCLC cells; these findings were confirmed at the protein level as well.
Moreover, osimertinib-resistant cells possessed elevated levels of PGC1 and PPAR, which were resistant to
modulation by osimertinib. Importantly, inhibition of both PGC1 with knockdown and PPAR with knockdown
or different chemical antagonists restored the sensitivities of osimertinib-resistant cell lines to osimertinib.
These data suggest a critical role of the PGC1/PPAR axis in mediating therapeutic efficacy of osimertinib in
EGFR mutant NSCLC cells. Thus, we hypothesize that effective inhibition of the PGC1/PPAR axis is a
critical and essential event in maintaining long-term therapeutic efficacy of osimertinib or other 3rd generation
EGFR-TKIs in the treatment of EGFR mutant NSCLCs. This hypothesis will be tested by accomplishing the
following specific aims: 1) To demonstrate the biological significance of PGC1/PPAR modulation in
regulating the responses of EGFR mutant NSCLC cells to osimertinib including the development of acquired
resistance; 2) To elucidate the molecular mechanisms accounting for downregulation of PGC1 and PPAR by
osimertinib in EGFR mutant NSCLC cells; and 3) To develop efficacious strategies for overcoming acquired
resistance to osimertinib by targeting PPAR. The objectives of this proposal are to fully demonstrate the
mechanisms by which osimertinib negatively regulates PPARGC1B expression in EGFR mutant NSCLC cells,
to reveal the crucial role of PGC1/PPAR in mediating response of EGFR mutant NSCLC cells to 3rd
generation EGFR-TKIs including the development of acquired resistance, and to develop effective therapeutic
strategies to delay or overcome osimertinib acquired resistance by targeting this axis. This proposal will allow
us to gain new knowledge and deep understanding of the biology of 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs, and to develop
innovative therapeutic strategies for managing acquired resistance to 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs."

Defects in Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is widely implicated in various birth defects and cancers. The
transduction of Hh signaling relies on the primary cilium, a miniature cell surface organelle known as
the antenna of the cell. To activate Hh signaling, almost all protein transducers need to transit through
the cilium. However, the molecular mechanisms of these protein transportation are not completely
understood; and the signaling cascade within the cilium also remains unclear in the field. Our goal is to
fill this gap with mechanistic studies of novel cilium proteins in the regulation of Hh signaling in vitro and
in vivo. In preliminary studies, we have leveraged a new proximity-labeling tool and built an experimental
platform to discovery new signaling proteins in the cilium with quantitative proteomics. We discovered
surprising cilium localization of a molecule involved in receptor internalization during neural
development. In this proposal, we aim to 1) decipher how the new cilium molecule control protein
transport in the cilium during Hh signal activation; 2) determine its role in the Hh-controlled neural
progenitor proliferation in the developing brain; and 3) apply the proximity biotinylation approach to
identify new proteins involved in Smo trafficking and signaling during the time course of Hh activation.
Our approach is innovative because it will reveal a new function of an old protein in the cilium during
Hh transduction, and it employs a newly developed biotinylation tool to gain the systematic view of
signaling proteins during Hh signaling activation. Upon completion, our study will shed light on long
standing questions in the Hh pathway and may highlight new methods for the intervention of Hh related
developmental disorders."

The most severe clinical complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection is cerebral malaria (CM) which has
high morbidity despite treatment. The spread of malaria is becoming increasingly more serious as Plasmodium
falciparum develops resistance to traditional drugs used to treat the condition. For the above reasons,
understanding the etiology of CM is critical to treat this highly significant global issue. Recently, more rigorous
large scale MRI studies have been conducted on CM patients. As previously hypothesized, disruption of the
blood-brain barrier (BBB), extensive edema, and brain swelling are associated with fatal human CM. Given the
above observations in human CM, the mechanism of BBB disruption and vascular permeability needs to be
defined. Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection of mice is an established model of human CM.
Considerable CNS pathology associated with PbA infection is driven by an acute CD8 T cell response which
induces disruption of BBB tight junction proteins and CNS vascular permeability. Using our novel MHC class I
conditional knockout mice, we have determined that macrophages and dendritic cells prime non-equivalent
CD8 T cell responses in response to PbA infection. While both antigen presenting cells prime CD8 T cell
response that infiltrate the brain, only CD8 T cells raised by dendritic cells induce lethal blood-brain barrier
disruption. Our central hypothesis is that specific APC subsets, namely macrophages, microglia, and
dendritic cells, contribute to the generation distinct brain infiltrating CD8 T cell responses against PbA
infection. These distinct CD8 T cell responses have differential ability to induce fatal BBB disruption.
We plan to test this central hypothesis through execution of the following specific aims:
Specific Aim #1 – Define the brain infiltrating CD8 T cell repertoire raised by LysM+ and CD11c+ APCs
during acute PbA infection.
Specific Aim #2 – Identify the CD11c+ APC required for CD8 T cell mediated BBB disruption.
Specific Aim #3 – Determine the capacity of CD8 T cell populations primed by distinct antigen
presenting cell types to inflict BBB disruption during the effector phase of PbA infection.
The proposed work is innovative because it capitalizes on our unique transgenic mouse models, novel imaging
methodology, and new core facilities available to our research program at Mayo Clinic. Our goal is to define
mechanistically the contribution of inflammation to BBB disruption in experimental human CM through
knowledge gained using a leading experimental model. Beyond the innovative methodology employed, the
concept that antigen presenting cells raise differential CD8 T cell responses is a highly novel finding which
warrants further investigation to a mechanism which is therapeutically targetable. This is especially important if
one form of CD8 T cell priming in vivo is initiating lethal neurological disease."
10828396,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immunity to malaria is complex, involving a fine interplay between immune compartments over time. Most prior
efforts to understand the development of immunity have been limited to a narrow set of measurements or
reductionist animal or human challenge models that fail to capture the complexity of repeated infection in
naturally exposed individuals. We propose to comprehensively evaluate and model the innate and adaptive
immune response to repeated P. falciparum (Pf) infections over time. This project takes advantage of a unique
malaria cohort study in Uganda, with participants seen in our clinic monthly and for all illnesses, allowing us to
capture both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. By leveraging our well-characterized cohort, detailed
immunological characterization of host responses, and state-of-the-art computational models of immunity, we
will 1) Comprehensively characterize the immune response to symptomatic and asymptomatic P.
falciparum infections. We hypothesize that symptomatic – but not asymptomatic – infections will be
characterized by an attenuation of the innate and adaptive inflammatory response. We will profile the innate
and adaptive immune response to symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in children at multiple time points
in the weeks following Pf infection. Data from transcriptional profiling, deep cellular phenotyping, antibody
profiling, and stimulation assays will be used to build flexible computational models, capturing interactions
between different compartments of the immune system and the trajectory of the immune response after a
single infection. 2) Determine how the immune state evolves in response to recurrent P. falciparum
infections. We hypothesize that recurrent infection will result in a shift of the immune state from one biased
towards dynamic, inflammatory immune responses to one characterized by a more stable, regulatory state and
the acquisition of functional antibodies. We will model the evolution of key immunological parameters identified
in Aim 1, along with assays of anti-parasitic humoral and cellular function, over years of repeated infection and
across ages by generating longitudinal data over a period of 2 years. This aim complements Aim 1 in providing
important information to define emergent properties of the immune response from cumulative infections over
longer time scales, spanning the period of immune acquisition. 3) Identify key aspects of the immune state
leading to anti-parasite and anti-disease immunity to P. falciparum infection. We hypothesize that
functional antibody responses will be most strongly associated with anti-parasite immunity, and that attenuation
of innate responses will be most strongly associated with anti-disease immunity. Guided by findings from Aims
1 and 2, we will develop computational models to identify the key determinants of clinical immune phenotypes,
obtained by evaluating the clinical outcomes of infection over the subsequent year. All models will be validated
and iteratively refined using data from independent individuals, external data and laboratory-based
experiments. Data and models will be made available and findable through appropriate public repositories."

This proposal outlines a training program for independent scientist with a focus on mRNA localization using
genetics and molecular biology. The research outlined in this proposal will develop a platform to evaluate local
translation, a process of whose disruption results in many neurological diseases and cancer. The phenomena
directing local translation to axon termini and the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) have been described. Scientists
have recently made the novel discovery that local translation also occurs at plasma membranes. For example,
in Caenorhabditis elegans, ezrin/radixin/moesin (erm-1) mRNA localizes to plasma membranes with its
encoded protein, a plasma membrane-actin cytoskeleton linker that will coordinate cell shape changes. erm-
1/ERM-1 undergoes translation-dependent localization and local translation directed by its N-terminal encoded
FERM domain. However, neither the mechanisms directing their localization nor the reasons for their local
translation are understood. The proposed research aims to use erm-1 as a model to understand how mRNA
localization to the plasma membrane arises mechanistically, functionally links to protein production, and
impacts gene expression. Based on preliminary evidence, the hypothesis is that cytoskeletal components
interact with the translating complex to direct it to the plasma membrane, similar to co-translational transport of
secretory proteins to the ER. This model will be explored from a genetics and molecular biology perspective
with 3 specific aims. The first aim will test whether erm-1/ERM-1 localization occurs through diffusion or
directed transport mechanisms and explore which cytoskeletal components are required. The second aim will
develop a live imaging tool to better resolve the kinetics of erm-1 translation. The third aim will identify the
effector proteins involved in this process. Since impaired mRNA localization in neurons and other cell types
causes disease but studying mRNA localization in disease-specific models is challenging, this project will
achieve our long-term goal of characterizing novel mRNA transport pathways that have the potential to be
generalizable in human health."
10829818,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Recent genetic data strongly suggest
that microglia-mediated innate immune activities may directly contribute to the AD mechanisms at early onset
and/or developmental stage of this disease. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning how
microglia are functionally involved in the pathogenesis of AD is beneficial for the development of new therapeutic
strategies for AD. Our long-term objective is to dissect the function of adaptor protein DAP12 in mediating
complex signals and executing their functions in microglia involved in AD pathogenesis. Our preliminary data
revealed a global effect of DAP12 deficiency in the brain transcriptome of tau P301S mouse, which reverses the
transcriptomic changes featured in the brains of multiple AD transgenic mouse models. We further found that
DAP12 deficiency increased brain tau pathology in tau P301S mice and reduced tau degradation by cultured
primary microglia. Yet, DAP12 deficiency significantly decreased brain microgliosis in tau P301S mice.
Therefore, we hypothesize that DAP12 plays differential roles in tau metabolism and microglia-mediated
inflammation during the pathogenesis of AD. We plan to fully characterize the role of DAP12 in these two AD-
relevant cellular events mediated by microglia and tau seeding/spreading. Finally we will further determine
signaling pathways altered by DAP12 deficiency on cell type specific manner in tauopathy mice."
10829942,"Malnutrition contributes to half of all global child deaths. Severe malnutrition interferes with the liver’s synthesis
of albumin, complement and coagulation factors, and bile acids (BAs). BA deficiency impairs nutrient absorption
and growth and alters signaling through nuclear receptors including farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) to impact a wide
range of processes. Using a mouse model of early postnatal malnutrition, we reported that decreased BA
synthesis in malnutrition causes decreased FXR activation and decreased expression of FXR target genes
including coagulation factors. The resulting malnutrition-induced coagulopathy can cause child mortality. It is
not known why BA synthesis is impaired in malnutrition. Our published data and new preliminary data
indicate malnutrition impairs the activity (not expression) of the rate-determining enzyme (CYP7A1) in the classic
pathway of BA synthesis due to depletion of the essential cofactor heme. We present novel evidence that
restoring heme increases BA synthesis. We now seek to understand why heme synthesis is impaired in
malnutrition. Heme is generated from tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle products and enzymes that require iron-
sulfur (Fe-S) clusters for stability. Fe-S clusters are derived from both Fe and S-containing amino acids
(AAs), which are found in dietary protein or generated by transsulfuration. Like most low-protein diets, our mouse
malnourishing diet is deficient in S-containing AAs. The mice exhibit decreased expression of transsulfuration
and Fe-S cluster-dependent TCA cycle enzymes, suggesting that deficiency of S-containing AAs and Fe-S
clusters drives liver dysfunction in malnutrition. Indeed, we decreased BA synthesis by 50% by maintaining
hepatocytes in low-AA media, and we restored BA production by adding S-containing AAs (but not other AAs).
Thus, we hypothesize that deficiency of S-containing AAs in malnutrition impairs BA synthesis by disrupting
TCA cycle function, heme biosynthesis, and CYP7A1 activity. Our Specific Aims are to 1) Characterize in AA-
deficient hepatocytes TCA cycle dysfunction by quantifying flux of labeled glucose through the TCA cycle and
measuring expression levels and activity of Fe-S cluster-dependent TCA cycle enzymes before and after heme
treatment; 2) Define the role of S-containing AAs and heme in BA synthesis by measuring BA synthesis by
hepatocytes maintained in low-AA media and treated in a high-throughput manner with combinations of AAs and
heme and using adeno-associated virus or siRNA to manipulate levels of transsulfuration and Fe-S cluster-
dependent enzymes; and 3) Determine whether a novel nutritional therapeutic can rescue BA synthesis in
malnutrition by feeding mice the malnourishing diet supplemented by S-containing AAs, then quantifying TCA
cycle function, heme synthesis, and BA production in primary hepatocytes. Expected outcomes include
elucidation of a novel link between malnutrition, TCA cycle and heme homeostasis, and BA synthesis.
The research is significant because of its potential to develop a scalable AA-based therapeutic to restore liver
synthetic function and treat malnutrition in children."

Kentucky (KY) is a high priority Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) jurisdiction due to heavy rural HIV burden and
exceptionally high rates of new HIV diagnoses driven by injection drug use (IDU). Despite ongoing need for
robust HIV prevention and the strong evidence for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), uptake remains severely
limited among people who inject drugs (PWID). PWID are notably impacted by structural challenges that
impede entry and retention in PrEP care, including poverty and unstable housing, violence, social isolation,
and stigma; in rural and remote areas, including Appalachia, limited healthcare access and a dearth of PrEP
providers further constrain access to PrEP along geographic boundaries. An interim assessment of EHE
progress notes that PrEP coverage remains well below threshold to reach established EHE targets, and sets
out broad policy recommendations to enhance PrEP access by engaging people where they are. For
PWID in particular, there is broad scientific consensus that PrEP efforts be intensified and intentional in
supporting low threshold PrEP access. The proposed R34 will leverage KY’s robust harm reduction
infrastructure to develop, integrate and test a low threshold peer-facilitated TelePrEP intervention for
Appalachian PWID in syringe service programs (SSPs) that operate within “PrEP deserts,” filling a critical need
to implement innovative approaches that mitigate geographic disparities in PrEP access. The PI’s ongoing
research and existing partnerships with local health department SSPs in Appalachian KY have demonstrated
that PWID have low PrEP awareness and social determinant barriers to PrEP uptake, yet interest in PrEP is
high, at 73%. Building on this existing work, we will conduct a pilot randomized trial to examine efficacy on
PrEP initiation (measured by dispensed PrEP prescription) and retention in PrEP care 3- and 6- months post-
baseline (measured by self-report and biomarker confirmation) as well as implementation outcomes guided by
the Implementation Outcomes Framework. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Collaborate with the Clark County
HD (CCHD) and Kentucky River District HD (KRDHD) harm reduction communities to develop the optimal
content, delivery structure, and implementation strategies for the peer-facilitated TelePrEP intervention in
SSPs and rapidly manualize the novel low threshold protocol; 2) Conduct a pilot randomized trial to evaluate
the preliminary efficacy of: a) peer-facilitated, integrated TelePrEP; compared with b) peer-delivered PrEP
education and referral, on PrEP initiation and persistence among Appalachian PWID; and, 3) Examine
feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and fidelity implementation outcomes of the two intervention
comparators among PWID participants and partner harm reduction staff using a mixed methods approach.
The proposed study will establish preliminary evidence and proof-of-concept for an integrated low-threshold
TelePrEP intervention for Appalachian PWID, which is designed to increase PrEP initiation and persistence."
10838780,"Abstract/Project Summary
Emerging preclinical data and clinical evidence support the existence of a bidirectional communication between
the gut microbiome and the central nervous system. Recently, the gut microbiome has been shown to play a
critical role in the development and function of the central nervous system (CNS). While advanced age as well
as immune and metabolic alterations can lead to increased permeability of tissue barriers, evidence shows gut
microbes signal to the brain even in young, healthy humans and in animal models. Signaling through the vagal
nerve may play a role in these situations, but the exact mechanism of this communication remains to be
confirmed. Bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) have recently been shown to carry information over long-
distances modulating interkingdom communication within the gut microbiota brain axis. Both gram negative and
more recently gram-positive bacteria have been shown to release extracellular vesicles. These vesicles have
been shown to contain a variety of biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and small-molecule
metabolites and play a key role in the biology of bacteria. BEVs has been postulated to be the key underlying
mechanisms behind harmful or beneficial effects of many pathogenic, symbiont, and probiotic bacteria. Opioid
use disorders have been associated with dramatic alteration in the gut microbiome with the expansion of gram-
positive bacteria. Similarly, in humans and in animal models HIV infection is associated with microbial changes
resulting in elevated systemic endotoxin levels-a signature marker for HIV co-morbidity. Opioid abuse
exacerbates these effects both in PLWH and in animal models of HIV and substance use. The role of bacterial
extracellular vesicles in modulating the gut brain axis under these conditions has not been investigated. This
high risk, high reward R21 proposal is a pilot grant to establish proof of concept. Based on preliminary data and
published studies, we hypothesize that microbial dysbiosis associated with opioid use and in the context of HIV,
results in the expansion of distinct pathogenic bacterial communities leading to the secretion of BEVs which
acts as mediators that communicates with both immune cells and microglial cells to disrupt the gut-brain-axis.
Two specific aims are proposed to test this novel hypothesis. Specific Aim 1: Determine if bacterial EV’s
derived from fecal samples from Control, Morphine dependent, HIV/ART and Morphine
dependent/HIV/ART treated mice a) disrupt gut epithelial and brain endothelial barriers and b) cross gut
epithelial and blood brain barriers using in vitro gut epithelial and blood brain barrier models. We will
further investigate if BEVs modulate macrophage and microglial gene expression in co-cultures. Specific
Aim 2: Determine if Extracellular vesicles isolated from fecal samples from Control, Morphine dependent,
HIV/ART and Morphine dependent/HIV/ART treated mice a) disrupt epithelial barrier b) increase gut
epithelial permeability and c) cross gut epithelial barrier and Blood brain barrier in vivo. The clinical
relevance of these studies is that BEVs can be exploited for therapeutic purposes to deliver nano
pharmaceuticals systemically and to the CNS."
10855850,"Abstract:
Ewing’s Sarcoma (ES) is the second most common pediatric bone cancer. Intensified chemotherapy regimens
have only incrementally improved recurrent or metastatic ES outcomes, motivating research and development
of new treatment options to combat this deadly disease. The accumulation of large glycogen granules,
clinically known as Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive, is a clinical hallmark of ES. However, the origin and
pathology of ES-glycogen remains a critical knowledge gap and it has not been pursued as a therapeutic
target. Recent reports, including our own, reveal critical roles for complex carbohydrates such as glycogen and
N-linked glycans in tumor progression. We developed a robust and highly sensitive workflow called MALDI
imaging of complex carbohydrates (MICC) in situ with near single cell spatial resolution. Using this workflow,
we interrogated complex carbohydrates in over 1000 tumor specimens from prostate, lung, colon, and ES
patients. Our data demonstrate that: 1) high glycogen is a unique clinical hallmark of ES; 2) three independent
strategies (i.e., CRISPR knockout, small molecule inhibition, and genetic re-expression) led to dramatic
reduction of ES glycogen and resulted in blunted ES tumor growth in vivo in athymic mouse models; 3) a
glycogen synthase inhibitor synergized with metformin at improving AMPK activity and preventing
tumorigenesis. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence to support our hypothesis that glycogen is a
unique and clinically actionable hallmark of ES that can be leveraged in the clinic for both diagnostic and
therapeutic interventions. The objective of this study is to define the role of glycogen in ES clinical outcomes,
cancer metabolism, and leverage glycogen targeting strategies as therapeutic options for ES. To achieve this,
we will: Define diagnostic and predictive potentials of glycogen in ES clinical course. (Aim 1). Then, we will
Define spatio-cellular roles of ES glycogen utilization to support cancer growth. (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess
Glycogen as an ES therapeutic target. (Aim3). Our study presents a pioneering, integrated approach to explore
the distinct ES hallmark of excessive glycogen using powerful methodologies like mass spectrometry imaging
and unique clinical cohorts of ES tumors. This proposal builds on the foundation of exciting preliminary data
and our transdisciplinary team's expertise to define the ES clinical course, understand ES tumor metabolism,
and improve treatment of documented disease. Our findings will substantially enrich the knowledge base,
spurring the development of personalized therapies for ES patients who currently rely solely on conventional
chemotherapies. Our goal is to improving patient care outcomes and provide better treatment options for
children suffering from ES."
10857078,"Title: 3D Real-time Super-resolution Passive Cavitation Mapping in Laser Lithotripsy of Urinary Stone
Disease
Abstract:
In the United States, 1 in 11 individuals will experience a urinary stone disease (USD) in their lifetime. Laser
lithotripsy (LL) via ureteroscopy, in which pulsed laser light is used to progressively break the stones, has become
the choice of treatment for USD patients. In particular, “dusting” mode with low pulse energy and high frequency
has gained clinical popularity over “fragmenting” mode because of the fine dust produced, which eliminates the
need for basket retrieval and ureteral access sheaths, and thus greatly shortens the procedure time. Growing
evidence by us and others have discovered that cavitation bubble collapse plays a significant role in stone
dusting by Ho:YAG lasers, and maximizing cavitation activities is critically important for improving LL efficiency.
Despite the growing enthusiasm, the exact mechanism of cavitation in LL is not well understood and the optimal
LL settings for efficient dusting have not been defined. Such a paucity of knowledge is partially due to the lack
of imaging technologies for real-time feedback of cavitation activities during the LL treatment. B-mode ultrasound
imaging (or active cavitation mapping) is compatible with LL, but cannot image the short-lived transit bubbles
that undergo inertial cavitation and may also interfere with the bubble dynamics. Other imaging technologies,
such as x-ray CT, fluoroscopy and MRI, cannot detect cavitations due to the lack of contrast. In light of the clinical
need for more efficient LL, we propose to develop 3D super-resolution passive cavitation mapping (3D-SR-PCM)
that (1) is totally noninvasive and fully compatible with the LL treatment; (2) is capable of real-time monitoring of
the 3D cavitation activities at clinically-relevant depths (>10 cm deep) without background interference; and (3)
can achieve a cavitation localization resolution of ~50 µm, which is 10-fold better than the B-mode ultrasound
imaging. Our long-term objective of this project is to better understand the therapeutic impact of cavitation in
LL treatment, and develop more efficient LL with less adverse effects. Our central objective of this proposal is
to develop, validate, and optimize a safe, reliable, and precise imaging technology for real-time analysis of 3D
cavitation activities during LL treatment. We will pursue three specific aims: (1) develop the first 3D-SR-PCM
system with super-resolution bubble localization, automatic fiber tracking, and real-time cavitation analysis; (2)
thoroughly validate and optimize the 3D-SR-PCM system on kidney phantoms, and identify the most relevant
cavitation characteristics with stone damage under clinically realistic settings; and (3) apply the optimized 3D-
SR-PCM system on a swine model in vivo to evaluate the treatment efficiency with cavitation-imaging guidance,
and demonstrate its clinical feasibility through a pilot study on USD patients. The proposed 3D-SR-PCM is timely
and well justified, considering the growing USD epidemic and the rapid advance in LL technology. We expect
the outcome of this project will provide an enabling tool for optimizing the clinical LL strategies, and is anticipated
to impact the long-term surgical management of USD and further advance the LL technology."

efficient medium or high-throughput screening capabilities as well as the ability to analyze a multitude of
phenotypes in dozens of conditions. Core A will provide the following services: 1) assist Projects 1 and 2
with the optimization of imaging strategies, MEA recordings, and analysis of cultured neuron systems; 2)
perform high-content imaging (HCI) of neuroarchitectural phenotypes for Projects 1 and 2; 3) perform
multielectrode array (MEA) analysis of neuronal network electrophysiological phenotypes for Projects 1 and
2; 4) provide instruction of Center users for HCI, MEA recordings, and analysis; 5) facilitate the offline
analysis of data; 6) facilitate the storage of phenotypic data; 7) ensure quality control of data and analysis.
To accomplish this work in an efficient, cost-effective, and rigorous manner, Core A will exploit standardized
high-throughput workflows that unite innovative technologies with economies of scale. The Specific Aims of
Core A are: Aim 1. To assess the impact of SNVs in TRIO and SYNGAP1 on neuroarchitecture and network
activity in mouse neurons. Aim 2. To assess the impact of chemical modulators of GEF and GAP activity on
neuroarchitecture and network activity in mouse neurons. Aim 3. To assess the impact of genetic mutations
and chemical probes on human iPSC-derived neuronal models."
10855869,"Project Summary
Alcohol use in the Unites States is a public health crisis that costs the U.S. health care system $249 billion
annually. However, only about 10% of individuals with alcohol use disorder receive treatment and a significant
proportion will relapse within one year of treatment. These trends are especially troubling among young adults
who exhibit the highest prevalence of alcohol use disorder among U.S. cohorts but are least likely to seek
treatment. Disruption of the body’s stress response system has been identified as a key factor that contributes
to risk of relapse and innovative and widely accessible interventions that help individuals cope with acute
stress during early recovery are urgently needed. Music listening has been shown to elicit activity in areas of
the brain associated with reward and emotions and has thus been proposed to be an effective tool for emotion
regulation and stress management. However, no relapse interventions have capitalized on the potential of
music listening to rehabilitate these systems. There is a lack of evidence that music-listening can influence
emotion regulation, and ultimately reduce acute stress, in real-world settings and uncontrolled environments.
We aim to develop the first just-in-time adaptive music-listening intervention to regulate emotions and reduce
stress among individuals within the first 90 days of detoxification from alcohol use. We design the study with
two phases to address three aims: For Aim 1, we will conduct formative research with a sample of young
adults who have received treatment for alcohol use disorders and are within 90 days of sobriety to identify
features of music selections that are most effective in reducing stress in real-world, ambulatory settings; For
Aim 2, we will focus on developing mobile health technology that uses passive sensing and machine learning
to automatically predict moments of heightened stress in real-time and suggest specific musical selections
when stress is detected. During Aim 3, we will test the feasibility of a novel music-listening intervention among
a second sample of young adults who have received treatment for AUD and are within 90 days of sobriety.
The goal of our proposed study is to provide a cost-effective and accessible music-listening intervention to
support the increasing population of individuals struggling with relapse risk during early stages of recovery
from alcohol use disorder. This research will provide a critical foundation upon which large-scale efficacy
trials of adaptive just-in-time music interventions can be conducted."
10862390,"ABSTRACT – CORE B
Synaptic GEF and GAPs have emerged as significant players in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs).
While a large number of clinical variants have been reported in these genes in patients with NDDs, their
molecular and cellular consequences have not been systematically analyzed. The precise biological
functions of synaptic GEF and GAP in human neuronal subtypes remain unclear, while there are no chemical
tool compounds that can acutely manipulate their catalytic activity. Recent advances in the generation and
differentiation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer new opportunities for
elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms of NDDs. Certain unique capabilities of iPSC technologies are well
suited for the study of NDDs, including providing a platform for examining the effects of genetic approaches
or chemical probes on human neuron activity, morphology, and developmental processes, and enabling
investigations of distinct human neuronal subtypes. Our Center proposes to study genetic variants in human
synaptic GEF and GAP genes and their associated phenotypes in human iPSC-derived neurons. The
overarching goal of Core B is to provide high quality, efficient and cost-effective services to Center members
related to iPSC technologies. Core B will have an exclusive focus on the neurobiology of NDDs. Core B will
align with the goals of Projects 1 and 2 to interrogate NDD-relevant cellular and network phenotypes. All
data and cell lines generated by the Neurodevelopmental Stem Cell Core will be shared with the members
of our Center and the broader academic community. The specific aims of the Neurobiology Stem Cell Core
(Core B) are: 1) To generate, perform QC, expand and maintain high-quality iPSC lines. 2) To perform
CRISPR mutagenesis to generate isogenic lines with high-priority missense and nonsense mutations. 3) To
generate human iPSC-derived excitatory/inhibitory neuron cocultures."
10862657,"Community engagement
SUMMARY
The primary goals of the community engagement of the proposed MEDIC BTRR are (1) to disseminate and to
provide access to MicroED technology, and (2) to facilitate new and exciting research that perhaps is intractable
by other methods. This will be mainly accomplished by providing: (1) access to MicroED instrumentation and
facilitating interactions with experienced scientists to all who wish to conduct MicroED experiments as part of
their own research programs, and (2) outreach to relevant scientific communities in efforts to disseminate recent
MicroED advances in a direct and hands-on manner. The Gonen laboratory has worked diligently at community
outreach to spread MicroED technology by holding workshops, training new users and collaborated with many
groups from research laboratories across the country. To help facilitate continued expansion of MicroED and
further collaborations, the MEDIC center will be open to those researchers who have demonstrated a need and
desire to conduct MicroED experiments. Collaborators will be able to visit the MicroED imaging center from
around the country to engage in MicroED data collection and learn first-hand how to perform the data collection
and analysis. We foresee that the greatest collaborator base for MicroED will be within the existing
crystallography, cryoEM communities and chemists. Crystallographers have limited experience in the technique,
but a wealth of knowledge in crystallization, sample preparation, data collection, analysis using X-ray software
while cryoEM, users have access to equipment and cryoEM capabilities for data collection. Chemists and those
that are working on drug design and discovery are enthusiastic about MicroED for its potential in facilitating rapid
structure determination from femtogram amounts of material that are intractable by other methods. Therefore,
we will focus our outreach on these communities through the variety of means described below."
10862673,"METABOLISM CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY
Metabolism plays a fundamental role in the development of obesity and the pathological consequences of obesity
that lead to chronic disease. Dysregulation of energy balance and impaired storage or oxidation of substrates
are fundamental features of developing obesity and metabolic disease. Metabolic dysregulation is driven by both
alterations in cellular mitochondrial function and disruptions in whole body metabolic homeostasis. Therefore,
metabolic research that connects cellular mitochondrial energetics to whole body in vivo substrate metabolism
and energy expenditure is critical for understanding mechanisms underlying metabolic dysfunction, obesity, and
obesity-related disease states. The Metabolism (MET) core will provide the Kansas Center for Metabolism and
Obesity REsearch (KC-MORE) with expertise, methodologies, and equipment for the study of “metabolism” from
the cell to the whole body. Core missions of the MET core will be to develop a new central MET core facility for
pre-clinical Models (rodents) that provides a host of key measurements, allowing for thorough metabolic
phenotyping. These approaches will include expertise and equipment to quantify real time measures of in-vivo
energy metabolism, substrate metabolism, food intake regulation, and glucose/insulin tolerance testing along
with non-invasive measures of body composition in pre-clinical rodent models (rat and mice). A second core
feature of the MET core will be to provide resources to investigators to quantify mitochondrial energetics in cells
and tissues from both rodent and human samples. Finally, the MET core will also have the capability to perform
metabolic isotope methodologies (isotopic labeled glucose, fatty acids, etc.) for use in humans or rodent models
(in-vivo or ex-vivo) to quantify overall metabolic flux. In summary, the MET core services will be organized to
provide state-of-the art core services to investigators studying metabolism in pre-clinical rodent model systems
and to translational measures of mitochondrial energetics and stable metabolic isotopes for use in cells, tissues,
rodents, and human participants. The MET core is also designed to largely parallel the capabilities of the Human
Energy Balance core so that scientists in the KC-MORE can conduct translational studies in both rodents and
humans."
10862674,"CELLS, TISSUES, BIOANALYSIS AND BIOSTATISTICS CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY
Adding a translational component to confirm ideas generated using in vitro and animal models is a vital part of
biomedical research. This is especially critical for a multi-organ disease like obesity. The most common path
followed by basic scientists is to obtain human samples and perform bioanalytical tests confirming their findings
obtained from experimental models. But this is easier said than done. Researchers face many challenges in
bridging this translational gap including confusing regulatory paperwork, lack of willing clinical collaborators, lack
of infrastructure to obtain and store patient samples, and much more. The Cells, Tissues, Bioanalysis and
Biostatistics (CTBB) core is designed to address this very issue. The CTBB core will be a “soup to nuts” solution
where the entire pipeline of translational research will be made efficient and easy to use for basic science
researchers who are part of Kansas Center for Metabolism and Obesity REsearch (KC-MORE) and beyond.
The CTBB core has three components. The first is the Cells and Tissues Biorepository, which will develop
collaborations with clinicians willing to collect samples after obtaining necessary IRB permissions, and collect,
store, and dispense clinical samples to basic scientists, supported by clinical coordinator. The second component
is Bioanalytical services, where a trained research technician will be available to provide technical help to develop
and perform specific bioanalytical assays. Further, we will function as liaisons between several existing
institutional and regional NIH-funded core facilities and the COBRE investigators. These include Genomics core
and Flow Cytometry core facilities at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) and IDEA National
Resource for Quantitative Proteomics at University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. The third component of
the CTBB core is focused on biostatistics and bioinformatics expertise. For this, the CTBB core will collaborate
with the Quantitative Omics core, which is part of Kansas Institute for Precision Medicine COBRE at KUMC. The
CTBB core will partly support additional statisticians which will provide biostatistics and bioinformatics expertise
to KC-MORE researchers. Taken together, the CTBB core will generate an efficient, comprehensive translational
research pipeline, which will provide one stop solution for basic scientists to achieve translational research goals."
10862678,"PROJECT 2 (MORRIS): PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity is the strongest independent predictor for the onset and progression of metabolic diseases, such as type
2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Weight gain occurs due combination of increased food/energy intake
and decreased total energy expenditure to create a positive energy balance. Energy balance is not constant or
consistent, and therefore long-term weight gain occurs as a sum of numerous, small positive fluctuations over
time scales ranging from days to seasons. These acute episodes of positive energy balance occur as a complex
interaction of the current obesogenic environment and inappropriate regulation of energy homeostasis. Energy
homeostasis is regulated through the integration of peripheral neural, hormonal and nutrient signals by a
complex, interconnected central network, including the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH). The
VMH has been observed as involved in the regulation of both components of energy balance, energy expenditure
and energy intake, making it an important component of body weight regulation. The main goal of the proposed
3-year research plan is to establish an independent research line investigating the role of mitochondrial
lipid metabolism in ventromedial hypothalamus neurons on the regulation of energy homeostasis.
Activation of pathways involved in sensing reduced cellular energy state in the VMH have been proposed to
increase food intake through acute activation of neuron lipid metabolism. Further, inhibition of these same
pathways has been observed to increase whole-body energy expenditure. However, it is unknown whether
regulation of these two components of energy homeostasis is dependent upon mitochondrial lipid metabolism in
VMH neurons. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that neuronal mitochondrial lipid metabolism in the VMH
modulates systemic energy homeostasis regulation during exposure to energy dense diets through control of 1)
food intake and 2) energy expenditure. In this proposal, we will use a VMH-specific, PGC-1α knockout (VPGC1a-
/-) mouse model to study the role of neuron mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and respiratory function on food
intake regulation during fasting and satiety hormone exposure. Additional studies will examine whether
modulation of neuronal mitochondria lipid metabolism impacts high-fat/high-sucrose-induced weight gain. As a
corollary, both sets of studies will utilize adeno-associated virus to increase mitochondrial lipid metabolism in
VMH neurons through overexpression of PGC1a."
10862692,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (ADMINISTRATIVE CORE)
We have established an innovative Program entitled “Developmental Mechanisms of Human Idiopathic
Scoliosis”. This program combines unbiased gene discovery in humans, modeling and gene discovery in
zebrafish, and genomic analysis of gene regulatory sequences that are defining the underlying causes of
adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), the most common musculoskeletal disorder in children. Three research
groups are leading these efforts. Project 1 “Human” focuses on AIS gene discovery and is led by Carol Wise,
PD, PI, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children. Project
2 “Zebrafish” is led by Lila Solnica-Krezel, Washington University School of Medicine St. Louis, and her co-
investigator Dr. Ryan Gray, University of Texas. Project 3 “Genomics” is led by Nadav Ahituv, University of
California San Francisco. The Administrative Core will aid activities of the Program, which is already a working
collaborative, and will be ultimately responsible for its execution and productivity. The Program Director Dr. Wise,
the Core Administrator, Ms. Liza Nowlin, and web portal administrator Dr. Kidane will oversee the administration
of the Program. The Core will facilitate organization, communication, data flow, compliance, and productivity
between the research groups. Specific responsibilities of the Core will be to ensure effective and frequent
communication between component groups of the project by hosting regular meetings either virtually or in
person. These will include regular meetings with the Advisory Committee. Primary purposes of the meetings will be
to rigorously interpret results ensuring quality control, identify progress toward specified goals, and to interact with the
Advisory Committee. The Core will be responsible for confirming that requisite resources are available for each Project,
defining timelines for achieving specified goals, monitoring progress toward those goals, and helping to guide any
necessary programmatic changes. A major goal of our collaborative is to generate knowledge, tools, and resources that
will spur the field of spine deformity research forward. The Administrative Core will also oversee deposition of multi-omics
Programmatic data into SpineSource, a new tool that was developed in the prior award cycle to facilitate and centralize
communication and data sharing. We expect that SpineSource will become an important resource for not only our team
but other researchers and stakeholders in the area of spine and spinal deformity. Otherwise the Administrative Core
will be responsible for regularly monitoring budgets and ensuring that funding is disbursed appropriately, and for
compliance with ethical guidelines, with institutional and federal requirements (e.g. institutional review boards,
institutional animal care and use committees), and with data-sharing policies. Finally, the Core will facilitate the
preparation and submission of manuscripts, ensuring fairness and consistency with NIH public access policies.
In these ways the Core will promote synergistic interaction within the Program and hasten the goal to decipher
the pathogenesis of AIS."
10862694,"Project Summary
Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a twisting condition of the spine and is the most common pediatric
musculoskeletal disorder, affecting 3% of children worldwide. Children with AIS risk severe disfigurement, back
pain, and physiologic dysfunction later in life, and are treated symptomatically rather than preventively because
the underlying etiology is unknown. Girls requiring treatment for AIS outnumber boys by more than five-fold. Our
overall purpose is to understand the biologic causes of AIS as a means to early diagnosis, prevention and non-
invasive biologic treatment. With support from this P01 in the previous award period we substantially increased the
number of validatedAIS susceptibility loci by large-scale multi-ethnic GWAS meta-analysis. Together with the other projects
in the program we also established that the cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) is a functional tissue in AIS. We
subsequently discovered that nonsynonymous variants in genes encoding ECM components COL11A1 and MMP14 are
associated with AIS. Together with genomics Project 3 we uncovered evidence of sex-biased PAX1-COL11A1
expression. In parallel, whole genome sequencing in families identified candidate mutations in AIS families that zebrafish
Project 2 is engineering into orthologous zebrafish genes. Here we propose to drive these discoveries forward to develop
mechanistic understanding of AIS pathogenesis. In one aim of the project, we will evaluate the consequences of
Col11a1 loss from chondrogenic lineages by generating Col11a1fl/fl /ATC Cre lines, inducing cre recombination
at embryologic and at early postnatal timepoints. Mutant offspring and their littermates will be evaluated
phenotypically and morphologically, by imaging, quantitative immunohistochemistry and mechanical strength
testing of growth plate and intervertebral disc (IVD) cartilages. With Project 3-Genomics we will also perform
single cell RNAseq coupled with ATAC-seq in IVD to define the role of Col11a1 at cellular levels. To characterize
the role of Mmp14 in mouse spine, we will characterize its spatio-temporal expression, and its cell-specific role
in spine development using MT1-MMPlacZ/+ knockin lines. In a second aim, we will continue reverse engineering
together with Project 2-Zebrafish and Project 3-Genomics to characterize the molecular and functional
consequences of spine deformity-associated mutations in vertebrate models. In a reciprocal fashion we will
cross-reference new scoliosis candidate alleles identified in Project 2-Zebrafish or Project 3-Genomics with
those identified in our human cohorts. In a third aim we will discover novel high-risk scoliosis-associated variants
by genome sequencing extended families and a unique cohort of AIS treatment non-responders. We will also
identify new spine deformity mutants from our highly productive ENU-induced genetic screen in mice. Building
on the momentum of our previous discoveries, we will synergize with Zebrafish Project 2 and Genomics
Project 3 in further defining pathways and developmental mechanisms of spine development and deformity. Our
collaborative will also continue to define the genetic architecture of AIS and yield tools that will enable better
diagnosis, interventions, and preventions."
10862697,"Project Abstract
Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common spine disorder affecting nearly 3% of pediatric
population worldwide, presenting in otherwise healthy children without overt structural defects of vertebral units.
AIS is more common in young women. More severe cases require bracing or surgery. Despite its medical
significance, understanding of the genetic bases and pathogenesis of AIS is just beginning and is driven by
advances in human genetic studies, combined with forward and reverse genetic approaches in zebrafish and
mouse, to which our collaborative Program Project team significantly contributed in the first funding period.
 During the previous funding period, our Project 2-Zebrafish screened 1,673 chemically-mutagenized F3
zebrafish families for mutations affecting spine development, yielding 73 recessive juvenile and adult scoliosis
mutants. Whole genome and exome sequencing of 20 alleles, mapped them to 13 chromosomal loci, implicating
numerous genes in normal spine development and indicating the screen is far from saturation. Our forward and
reverse genetic efforts in collaboration with Project 1-Human and the Project 3-Genomics of this program
identify (i) components of extracellular matrix, ii) inflammation, and (ii) pathways affecting the assembly of the
Reissner fiber as culprits in scoliosis. Surprisingly, scoliosis phenotypes often result from hypomorphic mutations
in otherwise essential genes, including adamts9 and scospondin.
 Leveraging the momentum of our productive forward genetic screen, here we propose to extend our
morphologic scoliosis screen from 1 to 3 months post fertilization, allowing us to find new genes and pathways
and monitor systematically sex distribution of the scoliosis phenotypes. New mutant loci molecularly
characterized by whole exome or whole genome sequencing will become candidates for human genetic studies
in Project 1-Human and for analyses of regulatory elements in Project 3-Genomics of this program. Applying
highly efficient genome disruption and editing approaches, we will validate candidate loci identified by Project 1
in human AIS patients, including protein-altering mutations in RAPGEF3 and LBX1 genes. We will define the
underlying tissue, and molecular mechanisms underlying scoliosis in the zebrafish mutants identified by our
forward and reverse genetic approaches, through comprehensive assessment of skeletal morphology, bone
density, inflammation pathways, the Reissner fiber formation and maintenance, transcriptomes and physiology
of the spinal canal. We will test the ability of rationally chosen drugs to suppress the phenotypes.
 Our genetic efforts in Project 2-Zebrafish will complement and synergize with the Project 1-Human and
Project 3-Genomics components of this program to provide the first atlas of genes and will define genetic
pathways critical for proper spine development in general and to AIS specifically."
10862700,"PROJECT 3 - SUMMARY
Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) affects ~3% of the population worldwide and is estimated to cost several
billion dollars annually in surgeries alone in the US. The causes of AIS remain largely unknown. While
mutations in genes leading to syndromic scoliosis (associated with other symptoms) have been discovered, the
identification of mutations causing non-syndromic/isolated AIS (only AIS without any other symptoms), have
been less successful. Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified AIS-associated single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in noncoding regions adjacent to promising candidate genes, suggesting a
role for gene regulatory sequences, such as enhancers, in AIS. In our preliminary results, we show that the
knockout of a spinal cord enhancer near an AIS GWAS associated region residing in the PAX1 locus, a gene
known to be involved in spinal development, is associated with a kinky tail phenotype, similar to the Pax1 gene
knockout and hypomorphic mutation. Interestingly, the kinky tail phenotype is more apparent in females, fitting
with the female specific AIS GWAS association that we observed for this region. Another hurdle in AIS
genetics is that until recently there were no specific tissue/s whose aberration was widely known to cause AIS.
Through work carried out by all three of our projects along with other investigators, the the cartilage
extracellular matrix (ECM), i.e. matrisome, was found to be strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of AIS.
Here, we will use total RNA-seq to characterize the noncoding RNAs expressed in these tissues. In addition,
using combined single-cell RNA/ATAC-seq on the cartilage matrisome to identify the genes and regulatory
elements associated with AIS in a single cell manner. In addition, we will carry out H3K4me3 (a mark for active
promoters) and H3K27ac (a mark for active promoters and enhancers) Hi-ChIP, a technique that uses
chromatin conformation in combination with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to capture specific
chromosomal interactions, to identify the target genes of these AIS-associated regulatory elements. Our
genomic datasets will also feed into Project 1 (Human) and Project 2 (Zebrafish) providing candidate genes
and regulatory elements to screen for AIS-associated mutations/phenotypes. To functionally characterize AIS-
associated regulatory elements, we will use regulatory element assays in cell lines and mice combined with
mouse knockouts to characterize gene regulatory sequences that are associated with AIS. These sequences
will be selected from GWAS, both from the literature and Project 1 (Human), whole-genome sequencing on
individuals with AIS carried out by Project 1 (Human) and near genes shown to cause AIS in zebrafish from our
Project 2 (Zebrafish). Our preliminary results for the Pax1 enhancer knockout already attest for the potential of
this approach. Combined, our work will provide a genomic encyclopedia of genes and regulatory elements that
could be associated with AIS and serve as a model for the functional characterization of gene regulatory
elements involved in additional subtypes of scoliosis, musculoskeletal and other human disease."
10858899,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The fidelity of DNA replication is critical in ensuring the stability of the genome from cell division to the next.
Accurate DNA synthesis by replicative DNA requires appropriate levels and ratios of deoxyribonucleotide
triphosphates (dNTPs), the building blocks of DNA, and is enhanced by the polymerase proofreading
exonuclease function. The mismatch repair (MMR) system functions as a spell-check for DNA replication,
detecting and directing repair of replication errors that evade proofreading. When dNTP pools are dysregulated,
it interferes with the normal functioning of the replisome. Elevated dNTP pools lead to an increased rate of
nucleotide misincorporation, increase the rate of DNA replication and alter the number of replication origins that
are activated. Altering the dNTP pools in different ways (elevated, skewed) leads to distinct mutation profiles.
These misincorporation events are substrates for MMR, but as the mutation rates increase, MMR can become
saturated. Thus, altered dNTPs can promote mutagenesis that can lead to cancer. At the same time, cancer
cells have elevated dNTP pools to maintain rapid proliferation. This can, in turn, lead to further mutagenesis and
promote the molecular evolution of the cancer, providing a selective advantage. In this proposal, we hypothesize
that elevated dNTP pools fundamentally change the activity of the replisome, both in terms of its function
inaccurately synthesizing DNA and its ability to respond to DNA lesions and blocks that it encounters during DNA
replication. In parallel, we are committed to the development of a diverse biomedical workforce, able to conduct
this type of research. We hypothesize that a supportive network of researchers will support the inclusion of
underrepresented groups in the biomedical sciences. In AIM 1, we will take advantage of the altered mutation
profiles in rnr1 backgrounds to define the relative contributions of MLH complexes to MMR, which remains
unknown. This will reveal important mechanistic details of the MMR pathway, including potential interactions
among the MLH complexes. We will also define the mechanisms underlying the synthetic lethality between
rnr1Y295A and mmr∆, potentially revealing a role for MMR in cell cycle checkpoint activation in the context of
altered dNTP pools. In AIM 2, we will determine the mechanisms underlying the different ways in which elevated
and/or skewed dNTP pools compromise the stability and normal progression of the replisome. We will
characterize differences in how DSBs at the fork are processed when dNTP pools are elevated. We will assess
Okazaki fragment processing in different rnr1 backgrounds. And we will use unbiased chemicogenomic screens
to reveal pathways that are important in supporting cell viability when rnr1 strains are exposed to different DNA
damaging agents that compromise replication fork progression. In AIM 3, we will establish a set of supportive
programs that will provide research opportunities for a wide range of students at different academic levels. We
will establish a Community Education Laboratory in Life Sciences that will offer authentic research experiences
to K-12 students in Buffalo who are not typically exposed to possibilities in the biomedical workforce."
10824781,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Chemical modification of proteins is an important strategy for understanding their structure/function and
has guided the design of new pharmaceutical products and targeted therapeutics. Accordingly, new technologies
that target amino acid side chains in both selective and unselective fashions are necessary to gain advanced
biochemical information. In bioconjugation processes, amino acids are selectively targeted and modified.
However, classical bioconjugation strategies rely upon the inherent nucleophilicity of amino acid side chains,
rendering the selective modification of less nucleophilic sites a significant challenge. At the same time, the ability
to rapidly modify a variety of amino acids is necessary for proximity labeling, a strategy where proteins are tagged
with reactive probes for mapping the cellular microenvironment to better understand spatial connections and
relationships between biomolecules. Visible light photoredox catalysis has emerged as a powerful platform for
modifying amino acids through redox events. The use of visible light as a sustainable and non-invasive stimulus
not only facilitates the mild generation of reactive intermediates, but also enables spatiotemporal control over
chemical reactivity, a desirable feature particularly in the treatment of disease. Nevertheless, the extension of
photoredox catalysis into biological applications is underexplored because photocatalyst activation requires high-
energy blue light, which penetrates tissue poorly and can result in background activation of molecules.
 This proposal describes the development and biological applications of red light bioconjugation and
proximity labeling platforms using Os(II) photocatalysts that proceed via the conversion of small molecules into
reactive probes that can react with amino acids selectively or promiscuously. A method for selective
bioconjugation of aspartic acid (Asp) and glutamic acid (Glu) is described wherein red light-photoexcited Os
photocatalysts activate vinyl azides into strained 2H-azirines, molecules that have been demonstrated to
undergo selective reactions with carboxylates instead of other more nucleophilic groups. A unique mechanism
is proposed upon reaction of a carboxylate group with photocatalytically-generated 2H-azirines to produce
oxazole-derived products in the covalent modification. A variety of Os catalysts with high triplet energy values
will be synthesized and evaluated in this method, which can then be translated to chemoselective labeling of
these residues on peptides and proteins. The ability of this class of photocatalysts to generate carbenes from
(trifluoromethyl)aryl diazos will also be explored. Reactivity will be established in the context of O–H insertion,
reactions with amino acids, and in isolated proteins. Due to their reactive nature, the carbenes react with a variety
of side chains rapidly, a feature that will be leveraged in tightening labeling radii in proximity labeling on cell
surfaces. Proximity labeling mediated by low energy red light presents two significant advances: (1) the use of
tissue-penetrating and noncytotoxic red light, and (2) minimization of any background substrate activation,
enabling high precision in spatiotemporal labeling."
10824810,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity and diabetes are an epidemic in the United States with more than third of US adults now defined as
obese. Some of the most effective therapies to manage glucose homeostasis and weight target the glucagon-
like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R). Many studies demonstrate that systemic GLP-1R agonists produce changes
in appetite and hypophagia through the activation of GLP-1Rs in the brain, where their expression is widespread.
Recent efforts to characterize the role of GLP-1Rs in specific brain nuclei and circuits have mainly focused on
the hypothalamus and hindbrain, whereas the function of GLP-1Rs in limbic systems like the amygdala have
received less attention and study. The amygdala, the brain’s emotional processing core, is well known for its role
in fear and anxiety, but recent data from our lab and others have demonstrated a clear role for positive valence,
promoting appetitive food-seeking behavior, and driving food intake. In a recent publication, our lab described
the expression of GLP-1Rs in the central subnucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and characterized the neural
physiology of GLP-1R-expressing neurons. In this fellowship, we will pursue a functional analysis of 1) GLP-1Rs
on the control of neural activity in the CeA and 2) determine the requisite role of CeA neural activity-changes on
the hypophagic actions of peripherally administered GLP-1R agonists. Our studies will have important
implications for understanding the cellular and molecular mechanism of action of now widely prescribed obesity
and type II diabetes therapeutics."
10825257,"SIGNIFICANCE: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of membrane proteins in the human
genome and are implicated in a wide array of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Notably, GPCRs are the
targets of one third of FDA approved therapeutics, including drugs prescribed for coronary heart disease,
hypertension, and asthma. However, of the ~800 known GPCRs, ~120 are orphan receptors (oGPCRs), which
are considered druggable targets but remain understudied in basic research efforts as they lack a known ligand.
Over the past two decades, extensive efforts to deorphanize oGPCRs have resulted in little turnout. It is evident
there is a need to increase the rate of discovery of ligands for oGPCRs. This proposal outlines a yeast directed
evolution platform for systematic, high-throughput discovery of antibody-based ligands for oGPCRs.
Deorphanizing a single oGPCR alone would open the door to understanding new biology and development of a
potential therapeutic agent.
BACKGROUND: oGPCR deorphanization efforts have been historically slow and low-throughput. Conventional
screens for oGPCR ligands can handle many targets, but due to the sheer amount of possibilities, including
protons, photons, lipids, hormones, peptides, and larger proteins, success has been limited. Nanobodies, or
small antibody fragments, offer distinct advantages for ligand screening, namely their suitability to directed
evolution. Directed evolution allows for billions of nanobodies to be screened for binding and modulation of
oGPCRs with a simple growth selection. Using a yeast-based hypermutation directed evolution platform, and a
precise, scalable, high-throughput continuous culture device, directed evolution campaigns can be scaled up to
ensure a deep search of nanobody sequence space.
SYNOPSIS OF AIMS: In this proposal are two related, but not interdependent aims. AIM1 establishes a
systematic workflow for the functional reconstitution of human GPCRs in yeast, which will (1) create a library of
yeast strains with orphan and non-orphan GPCRs, and (2) elucidate general guidelines to increase success
rates of GPCR expression in yeast. AIM2 takes oGPCRs found to be functional in yeast and uses them to run
directed evolution campaigns to discover nanobody ligands and validate these ligands in human cells. Both aims
can be developed in parallel, with results from AIM1 being progressively integrated into AIM2. Together, these
innovative platforms will lead to the deorphanization of many oGPCRs, thereby enabling the exploration of new
GPCR biology and pharmacology."

 Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and despite efforts to preserve
cardiac function in heart failure patients, preventing adverse remodeling and fibrosis remains a challenging
task. Cardiac fibrosis can negatively impact cardiac compliance and function, and is associated with
worsened outcomes in heart failure patients. Recent sequencing technology advancements hav e allowed
for the identification of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) as a marker of pathologically activated fibroblasts
present in failing hearts but not in healthy controls. This has raised the possibility of selectively depleting
FAP+ cells for heart failure therapy. One proposed strategy is to use chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T
cells that are engineered to express a surface receptor directed against FAP. Initial studies utilizing these
FAP CAR T cells in a mouse model of hypertensive cardiac injury have been promising, but the effects of
CAR T cells on the myocardial environment are not understood.
 The proposed project aims to investigate the feasibility of T cell engaging therapies as a strategy of
targeted cell depletion in cardiac fibrosis, and also investigate the modes of crosstalk between FAP CAR T
cells and other cell populations in the heart. These questions have broad implications for this novel cardiac
application of cellular immunotherapy. Preliminary data demonstrate that FAP CAR T cells can actually
worsen the development of fibrosis in an angiotensin II/phenylephrine mouse model of cardiac injury.
Importantly, expression of interferon gamma (IFN) and its targets is elevated in the hearts of FAP CAR T
cell treated mice compared to those of control T cell treated mice. IFN has been shown to worsen fibrosis
in other models of cardiac injury. We hypothesize that FAP CAR T cells can deplete activated fibroblasts,
and that this has an anti-fibrotic effect, but it is offset by pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic crosstalk between
FAP CAR T cells and other immune cells in the myocardium. Aim 1 of this proposal focuses on delineating
the feasibility of T cell engaging therapies in cardiac fibrosis. Specifically, it compares FAP CAR T cells to
other T cell-based therapies such as bispecific T cell engagers (BiTE®) in target cell depletion, IFN
activation, and fibrosis modulation. Aim 2 studies how blocking IFN signaling in FAP CAR T cell treated
mice affects the cellular and transcriptional landscape of the heart. It also investigates which cells are the
sources of IFN, which cells are responding to this signal during FAP CAR T cell treatment, and what
effects these signaling axes have on myocardial inflammation and fibrosis. Together these aims seek to
understand the effects and mechanisms of FAP CAR T cell cross talk with other myocardial immune
populations, and can potentially inform the field of strategies to refine T cell engaging therapies to
maximize efficacy and improve safety in the cardiac setting."

Eosinophils (eos) are a subset of white blood cells that are involved in multiple immune diseases, broadly termed
eosinophilic-associated diseases (EAD). Whether they are protective or contribute to disease pathology is not
always clear. For instance, eos are central to fighting infections caused by parasites. However, in asthma they
have been shown to cause tissue damage, as well as participate in tissue repair and regeneration. Our lab has
recently focused on eosinophilic heart disease, a serious consequence of hypereosinophilia in patients. The
function of eos in physiology and pathology is often correlated with the extracellular presence of their cytoplasmic
contents. Indeed, in the mouse model of eosinophilic heart disease that we developed, we see the presence of
extracellular eosinophil granules intimately associated with dying cardiomyocytes. Eos cytoplasmic contents are
released through a process of degranulation. Various methods of degranulation including cytolysis, a non-
apoptotic cell death, have been characterized. Although cell death is a natural and essential process in the life
cycle of all cells and organisms, the mechanism of cell death has significant impact on tissue homeostasis,
immune response, and diseases. This is particularly true for terminally differentiated cells like eos, whose
accumulation at sites of disease is regulated by recruitment and survival versus cell death stimuli. There are
several mechanisms of cell death, including apoptosis, accidental/non-regulated necrosis, and regulated
necrosis. The latter is a spectrum of cell death types that are different from the classical type of necrosis in that
they are triggered by specific stimuli and mediated by specific signaling pathways. Importantly, this makes it a
targetable process. Currently these cell death mechanisms have not been well characterized in eos. In my
preliminary studies, I have generated in vitro models of multiple eosinophil cell death types, using diverse stimuli
(staurosporine, ligation of Fas receptor, TNF𝛼 in presence of apoptosis inhibitor, H2O2, calcium ionophore) and
measuring different outcomes (expression of annexin V on outer plasma membrane leaflet, permeability to
7AAD, active caspase-3), which will be used to characterize mechanisms of eosinophil cell death.
Understanding mechanisms of eosinophil cell death that are destructive to tissue could provide novel targeted
therapies for EAD. Our long-term goal is to develop novel rational therapies for EADs based on understanding
of mechanisms of disease. The overall goal of this proposal is to define and characterize the different eos cell
death mechanisms and their impact on disease pathogenesis."
10825103,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Neuroinflammation, where immune cell overactivation can lead to catastrophic destruction of otherwise
healthy neuronal tissue, is a critical pathological feature of both Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Dissecting the pathways leading to pathological neuroinflammation and defining precise
immunomodulatory targets has the potential to greatly enhance therapeutic options for those suffering from
neurodegenerative diseases. 97% of ALS patients and 57% of AD patients present with dysregulation of the
RNA-binding protein TDP-43 in neurons, leading to disrupted RNA splicing of a variety of critical genes. Our
bioinformatic analysis has identified 23 genes commonly dysregulated by TDP-43 pathology in multiple
independent human studies; among these is STMN2, which we have characterized as a regulator of NMJ
function and stability, and ATP8A2, which has never been studied in the context of AD or ALS, yet is an extremely
attractive target for studying neuroinflammation. ATP8A2 is a phosphatidylserine (PS) flippase that regulates PS
exposure onto the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane, where it acts as the cellular “eat me” signal for
immune cell activation and phagocytosis. Aberrantly exposed PS can occur via flippase dysfunction, which is
sufficient to cause neuronal phagocytosis by neuroimmune cells. Humans with ATP8A2 mutations have severe
neurological dysfunction and ATP8A2 mutant mice develop axon degeneration, implicating ATP8A2 as a primary
regulator of neuroinflammation and axon loss, downstream of impaired TDP-43. Excitingly, we have found that
ATP8A2/STMN2 double heterozygote mice display a progressive decrease in motor strength that is significantly
different from either single heterozygote, demonstrating the utility of this model for investigating TDP-43
pathology. This project will determine the genetic and cellular regulators of PS exposure and neuroimmune cell
activation, and test the degree to which ATP8A2 deficiency exacerbates the neurodegenerative phenotypes (e.g.
STMN2-mediated NMJ defects) observed in TDP-43 pathology. If successful, this project will characterize the
fundamental mechanisms of neuron/immune cell interactions, and define potential therapeutic targets against
neuroinflammation in AD or ALS.
 This project will occur at Washington University in St. Louis, a premier institute for biomedical research,
under the guidance of Aaron DiAntonio, who has become a leader in the field of axon degeneration over the past
two decades. The DiAntonio Lab’s record of success accentuates the resources and equipment available to
perform outstanding science, including two state-of-the-art tissue culture rooms, multiple automated cell imagers
and confocal microscopes, and access to a world-class mouse facility. Additionally, the extraordinary
neuroscience and immunology communities at Washington University provide excellent opportunities to facilitate
the growth and transition from trainee to independent investigator, which will occur through the classes, lectures,
journal clubs, retreats, and symposia offered by the institution."
10861838,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Binge drinking during adolescence has been identified as a potential risk factor for alcohol use disorder (AUD)
in adulthood. Despite this, the precise neuronal populations which are altered by adolescent drinking, and which
may contribute to changes in adulthood drinking, have not been fully characterized. Somatostatin (SST)-
expressing neurons in the prelimbic (PL) cortex are altered by adult binge drinking in animals models, and
manipulating the activity of these neurons can reduce binge drinking. The goal of this proposal is to determine
the role of SST neurons following adolescent binge drinking, as well as during escalated adulthood alcohol
consumption following adolescent exposure. The first set of experiments will use whole-cell patch-clamp
electrophysiology and fiber photometry to understand how adolescent alcohol use affects SST neurons in the PL
cortex. The second set of experiments will use behavioral and chemogenetic manipulations to identify a causal
role for SST neurons in changes in adulthood alcohol consumption after adolescent binge drinking."
10861840,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 In treating type 2 diabetes (T2D), there is a paucity of medications simultaneously targeting deficits in both
β-cell function and mass. Angiotensin(1-7), a metabolite of the renin-angiotensin system, may fill this gap;
however, its underlying mechanisms of action are incompletely understood. Our data reveal that the
insulinotropic action of angiotensin(1-7) is dependent on its hydrolysis to the dipeptide, angiotensin(1-2), the
latter also conveying pro-survival and proliferative effects in β cells. Angiotensin(1-2) activates G-protein-
coupled receptor family C group 6 member A (GPRC6A), which we show is expressed in islet a cells. Further,
angiotensin(1-2) increases a cell-derived glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) release, suggesting it acts via
GPRC6A on the a cell to promote insulin secretion in a paracrine fashion. Indeed, in GLP-1 receptor deficient
islets, we find that angiotensin(1-2) fails to potentiate insulin secretion; however, its ability to enhance β-cell
survival and proliferation is retained. The latter suggests angiotensin(1-2)’s action is, in part, GLP-1 receptor-
independent. Based on these novel data, we hypothesize angiotensin(1-2) enhances β-cell function via intra-
islet paracrine signaling, and promotes β-cell survival/proliferation via a novel GLP-1-independent mechanism.
 The following specific aims address this hypothesis, with the goal of improving treatment options in T2D:
Specific Aim 1. To determine the mechanism by which angiotensin(1-2) increases islet-derived GLP-1
and insulin secretion. Mice (in vivo) and islets (in vitro) with diphtheria toxin-induced a-cell destruction or a
cell-specific GPRC6A knockout will be used to determine whether angiotensin(1-2)-mediated increases in
insulin release require a cells or a-cell GPRC6A, respectively. We will probe mechanisms for increased GLP-1
release, and confirm key findings in human islets with and without GLP-1 receptor or GPRC6A blockade.
Specific Aim 2. To identify signaling pathways/proteins mediating the β-cell survival and proliferative
effects of Ang(1-2) in human islets. The ability of angiotensin(1-2) to inhibit apoptosis, reduce
dedifferentiation and enhance proliferation of β cells will be examined in human islets under non-diabetic and
diabetic conditions. The contribution of mechanisms independent of GLP-1 or GPRC6A will be determined.
Effectors of angiotensin(1-2) action will be identified using non-biased phosphoproteomics, then loss-/gain-of-
function studies in islets will serve as a preliminary screen for effectors that could be targeted therapeutically.
Specific Aim 3. To determine whether Ang(1-2) improves human islet function/survival in vivo, and
whether hydrolysis of Ang(1-7) is required for its anti-diabetic effects. We will utilize a human islet
transplant model to determine the ability of angiotensin(1-2) to improve β-cell function/survival and glycemia in
diabetic mice. Further, we will test whether the insulinotropic action of angiotensin(1-7) requires its hydrolysis,
as is the case in vitro. The latter is highly significant for clinical management of T2D because it will inform on
the utility of hydrolysis-resistant angiotensin(1-7)-based medications currently in development."
10861877,"Recognized as a major public health problem for civilian and military populations, traumatic brain injury
(TBI) produces a broad range of cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physical symptoms. These symptoms
impede community reintegration (participation in family, work, school, meaningful activities) and decrease
quality of life (QoL). TBI also has a profound impact on family caregivers, who often struggle with depression,
high levels of burden from caregiving demands, and many unmet needs. Standard approaches to TBI care
typically provide post-acute rehabilitation for recent injuries (within 1 year post injury). Yet, years after injury,
many persons still experience chronic TBI symptoms and are often left to manage these on their own.
Furthermore, standard rehabilitation focuses primarily on medical restoration to reduce deficits rather than on
symptom management, is clinic based, and rarely engages families, despite their critical role in rehabilitation.
 The proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) will evaluate an innovative rehabilitation approach for
persons with chronic TBI-related symptoms (> 1 year post injury) and their families. Based on the person-
environment fit framework, HOME (Home-based Occupational-therapy and Management of the Environment)
for Us is a 4-month, 8-session intervention delivered by occupational therapists in the home, designed to
improve community reintegration, ability to manage self-identified TBI-related problems, and quality of life in
persons with TBI. HOME targets the home environment (physical and social) to realign environmental
demands to individual strengths and deficits. HOME engages persons with TBI and family caregivers in
strategies to manage chronic TBI symptoms. It educates family members to reinforce and maintain intervention
strategies, and also addresses family needs.
 Our earlier research with veterans with TBI demonstrated the efficacy of this approach in improving
community reintegration and ability to manage self-identified TBI-related problems. Family members
experienced lower depressive symptoms and caregiver burden, compared to controls, and the program was
highly acceptable to both. These findings warrant moving forward to extend the project by: including civilians
with TBI as well as veterans; using an attention-control condition; testing maintenance effects at 6 months after
treatment completion and exploring generalization to new problems or situations. A 2-group randomized
controlled trial will be conducted with 220 community-dwelling civilians and veterans with chronic TBI-related
symptoms (> 1 year post injury) and their family caregivers. Outcomes for persons with TBI will be community
reintegration, quality of life, and ability to manage patient-identified TBI-related problems. Family caregiver
outcomes will be burden, depressive symptoms, and met family needs. Treatment effects will be compared to
controls at 4 months, and maintenance and generalization effects will be evaluated at 10 months. The study
addresses a critical gap in services and research for persons with chronic TBI symptoms and their families."

Conventional augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices for people with
severe speech and motor impairments (SSMI) rely on residual motor function, inherently
limiting communication throughput. Commercially available AAC solutions require daily
caregiver setup, need frequent recalibration often from a technically savvy caregiver, are often
unable to be used in dark lighting conditions, and can encumber or fatigue important remaining
physical abilities. Furthermore, for people with progressive motor dysfunction due to
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), even the most well-designed AAC devices will eventually
fail as movements become unreliable. For people with brainstem stroke, ALS, and other
disorders causing locked-in syndrome (LIS) or SSMI, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) hold
promise as a method of enabling communication that does not rely upon speech or voluntary
movement. In prior NIDCD-supported research, our BrainGate research team provided early
proofs of principle of a powerful intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) that decodes
movement intentions directly from brain activity. This technology has allowed people to control
a cursor on a computer screen for communication simply by imagining movements of their own
arm. The proposed NIDCD U01 clinical research will further the development and testing of a
fully implanted iBCI that could provide robust, intuitive control of industry-grade communication
apps for people with LIS or SSMI. By leveraging the ongoing pilot clinical trials of the
investigational BrainGate system, we aim to (1) improve the robustness and accuracy of
neurally actuated point-and click, in part through the translation of neuronal activity from
human premotor and motor cortex, (2) expand the number of input dimensions to tablet

performance of the investigational BrainGate system to trial participants’ conventional AAC
systems with respect to communication competence, information throughput, user preference
and outcomes measures. By incorporating the feedback of six individual participants with

the metrics needed for a subsequent pivotal trial of a fully implanted, always-available iBCI

Obesity affects more than 1.4 billion adults worldwide and is a significant risk factor for chronic diseases such
as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Present non-operative treatment options of obesity are
woefully inadequate. Bariatric surgery is effective but invasive, costly, and associated with significant morbidity.
Intragastric balloons (IGB) have been demonstrated to be effective in enabling temporary weight loss (~25-30%
of excess body weight), allowing the improvement of metabolic parameters. However, IGB is a passive
mechanical construct that cannot be monitored or controlled upon insertion and require endoscopy delivery.
These fundamental attributes limit the reach of IGB to very selected patients as a temporary treatment or as a
bridging intervention to bariatric surgery despite its effectiveness. The proposed research will overcome the
fundamental limitations of IGB by creating an ingestible gastric-resident electronic-enhanced metamaterial
architecture (iGEM). In stark contrast to the current strategies, iGEM can transform obesity treatment with a
digital-based personalized and dynamic treatment strategy. iGEM allows the dynamic tuning of gastric restrictive
effect, which can be optimized based on safety consideration, patient’s treatment goals, and the quality of life
desired. For example, feedback-based control of the device distension can prevent excessive pressure point or
over-inflation that may lead to ulcer formation; or to avoid intestinal obstruction due to premature disintegration.
The ability to adjust gastric restrictive pressure can enhance treatment effectiveness to account for gastric
accommodation. The ability to acquire sensing data can help elucidate the complex relationship between the
restrictive effect of intragastric devices and treatment effectiveness. This research leverages Kong’s expertise
in creating entirely 3D printable electronics and ingestible electronics, (2) Wang’s (Ph.D.) expertise in meta-
materials design, and (3) Fang’s (M.D.) extensive clinical and clinical research experience in IGB usage and
intragastric devices. Specifically, we will (1) develop wireless resonant-enhanced 3D printable gastric pressure
sensors with a hybrid core-shell printing methodology that allow the integration of pressure sensors on a wide
range of intragastric systems; (2) develop wirelessly triggered transformable active metamaterials architecture
that is capable of achieving wirelessly triggered reversible structural reconfiguration, allowing the oral ingestion
of the device, dynamic control of expansion to tailor gastric restriction effect and the safe excretion of the device
without risk of intestinal obstruction; (3) develop and evaluate iGEM longitudinal wireless pressure sensing and
triggerable volume control capability that can sustain the complex and dynamic gastric environment for a
prolonged period of time (30 days). Upon completion of the proposed research, the foundation established by
this proposed work is also applicable to include a wide range of inductance/capacitance-based sensors
(temperature, biochemical, bacterial), as well as various ingestible or implantable systems such as stents,
enabling multivariate longitudinal sensing and unprecedented control."

Abstract
The intestinal stem cell niche plays an essential role in enabling the self-renewal of the columnar
gut epithelium, a process that occurs continuously throughout life. Over the past five years we
have established that subepithelial fibroblasts resembling telocytes that express the DNA-binding
transcription factor Foxl1 are a critical component of the intestinal stem cell niche. Removal of
Wnt signals emanating from Foxl1+ cells or elimination of these specialized cells themselves
causes cessation of epithelial proliferation, crypt failure, and rapid death of mutant mice. In
addition, Foxl1+ cells demarcate critical signaling centers during intestinal development, and Foxl1
itself is required for villus development in fetal life. Based on these exciting findings, we have
built several crucial tools to further explore the function of Foxl1+ telocytes and fetal telocyte
precursors in three independent but interrelated specific aims. In specific aim 1, we will ablate
critical components of the planar cell polarity pathway in Foxl1+ telocyte precursors to determine
their contribution to villus formation during the epithelial transition in midgestation, based on our
findings from single cell RNAseq analysis that these factors are highly enriched in the Foxl1+
telocyte progenitor populations during villus formation, and the fact that villification is abnormal in
Foxl1 null embryos. In specific aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the closely linked Foxl1 and
Foxf1 genes function cooperatively in telocytes or their progenitors to control both gut
development and the function of the adult stem cell niche. We will employ an innovative ‘double
floxed’ mutant allele to ablate both genes simultaneously in the Foxl1+ lineage and analyze fetal
gut development and adult tissue homeostasis using histology, immuno-staining, and molecular
assays. Finally, based on our discovery that GLP-2R, the receptor for the intestinal mitogen GLP-
2, and its downstream signal IGF1 are highly enriched in Foxl1+ telocytes, we will test the
hypothesis that telocytes are the GLP-2 target cell using inducible conditional gene ablation of
both Glp2r and Igf1 and evaluate GLP-2 action in multiple paradigms. Together, these linked yet
independent aims will dramatically increase our understanding of intestinal telocyte biology, a cell
type we have shown to be a critical component of the intestinal stem cell niche."

 Calcium (Ca2+) is a critical regulator of neurotransmission in both axons and dendrites of neurons. Ca2+
fluctuations during neuronal activation are usually attributed to influx through voltage gated Ca2+ channels, but
in vitro evidence suggests that intracellular Ca2+ handling, particularly by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), could
shape cytosolic Ca2+ signals and therefore neurotransmission. Our preliminary data indicate that the ER in
neurons of the Drosophila visual system displays Ca2+ fluctuations in response to visual stimulus in vivo. Given
that altered ER Ca2+ signaling has been implicated in neurodegeneration and retinal degeneration, the objective
of this work is to determine the role of ER Ca2+ signaling in Drosophila visual system neurons and determine the
molecular basis of compartment specific ER Ca2+ signals in motion vision circuits. The first aim is to determine
the underlying mechanisms governing compartment specific ER Ca2+ signals using in vivo 2-photon microscopy.
Findings from this aim will help elucidate the functional roles of ER Ca2+ signals in axons and dendrites. The
second aim is to determine the role of ER Ca2+ handling neurotransmission and in motion vision circuit function,
leveraging genetic perturbations in well-defined circuits. These studies will determine if ER Ca2+ signaling shapes
cytosolic Ca2+ fluctuations, linking it to circuit function and neurotransmission in the visual system. The fellowship
training plan includes in vivo 2-photon imaging, Drosophila genetics, programming, and career guidance.
Through training opportunities during this project, I will develop the skills to complete this work, and continue in
a career in academic research."
10825267,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Angiogenesis is crucial for tissue homeostasis and growth. Despite extensive studies, it remains unclear how
angiogenesis is spatially and temporally regulated to drive therapeutic neovascularization or conversely to block
vascularization of tumors. Initiation of angiogenesis is a symmetry breaking process across scales: at tissue
level, a blood vessel must asymmetrically generate a new vessel; at cellular level, a polarized endothelial “tip”
cell must break symmetry by remodeling its cell-cell adhesions to initiate migration towards an angiogenic
stimulus. This symmetry break is carefully regulated, as a tip cell must maintain sufficient vascular endothelial
(VE)-cadherin-based adherens junctions with follower “stalk” cells to generate a continuous neovessel. VE-
cadherin remodeling is largely mediated by (1) VE-cadherin endocytosis and recycling and (2) remodeling of
junction-associated actomyosin. As these two processes closely regulate each other, it remains unclear what
initiates and regulates the break in symmetry that permits tip cell migration. To identify new molecular regulators
of VE-cadherin remodeling, VE-cadherin interactors were profiled using unbiased proximal biotinylation (BioID)
and mass spectrometry in Preliminary Studies, revealing Scribble (Scrib). Mice with germline Scrib loss in
literature exhibit developmental vascular defects; however, the subcellular endothelial role of Scrib in human
vascular development remains unclear. Preliminary studies show Scrib localizes at adherens junctions in primary
human microvascular endothelial cells, and this localization is regulated by angiogenic stimuli. Scrib knockout
3D organotypic microvessels exhibit aberrantly increased sprouting. Mechanistically, Scrib regulates VE-
cadherin turnover and junctional actomyosin. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that Scrib regulates
angiogenic symmetry breaking through limiting VE-cadherin remodeling, and this regulation is exerted through
stabilization of junctional actomyosin. This hypothesis will be tested by two Aims: (1) Determine how Scrib
regulates angiogenesis across endothelial tissue and cell scales, and (2) Elucidate molecular
mechanisms by which Scrib regulates VE-cadherin remodeling and endothelial symmetry breaking
during angiogenesis. These Aims leverage engineered vascular models, CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing of
primary human endothelial cells, and advanced live microscopy to capture unappreciated mechanisms
underlying angiogenic initiation. These research goals will be conducted alongside a comprehensive training
plan at the University of California, San Francisco, including structured conceptual and technical mentorship
from primary sponsor Dr. Matthew Kutys, an expert in endothelial cell-cell adhesions, morphogenesis, and
engineered vascular models. Co-sponsor and physician-scientist Dr. Dean Sheppard will provide further
conceptual, translational, and career mentorship. The applicant will gain additional training by participation in the
Cardiovascular Research Institute at UCSF and structured shadowing experiences with physician-scientists in
vascular biology. Altogether this work will provide invaluable training for an aspiring physician-vascular biologist."

gender men. However, the mechanisms involved are unknown and potential targets to ameliorate CV risk have
yet to be identified. To address this gap in knowledge, the Alexander laboratory has developed a novel model of
feminizing hormone therapy in the male rat that involves administration of E2 to mimic physiological levels
observed in age-matched female rats in conjunction with androgen suppression. My model mimics the increase
in E2, suppression of testosterone and decrease in body weight and lean mass observed in TGF individuals
indicating clinical relevance for this experimental model of GAHT. My studies will use two different rat strains,
the normotensive Sprague Dawley rat and the spontaneously hypertensive rat. Preexisting chronic disease such
as hypertension is contraindicated in GAHT. Yet, GAHT is integral for the treatment of gender dysphoria. To
date, basic research utilizing experimental models of GAHT are limited to nonexistent. Thus, a critical need
involves the use of innovative animal models to provide reliable risk assessment and in-depth investigation into
mechanisms that contribute to increased CV risk in adult TGF individuals that undergo GAHT. Therefore, my
F31 will test the following hypothesis that shifting the hormonal milieu with cross sex steroid treatment versus
natal sex, elevated estrogen coupled to testosterone suppression in the male, increases susceptibility to target
organ injury and cardiovascular risk that is enhanced with aging and involves an estrogen-induced male-specific
effect on the vasoconstrictor-vasodilator balance of the renin angiotensin system. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis
that the shift in the hormonal milieu in gender affirming hormone therapy in a rodent model of the transfemale
rat is associated with increased end organ damage and cardiovascular risk that is further exacerbated with
preexisting chronic disease. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that increased end organ damage and cardiovascular
risk in transgender females that undergo gender affirming hormone therapy involves an estradiol induced “male
sex-specific” effect on the renin angiotensin system. This grant will also further my training potential as I learn
“gold-standard” methods for measurement of blood pressure via radiotelemetry, assessment of end organ
damage in response to myocardial ischemia reperfusion with echocardiography by sonography, and ex vivo
vascular function studies. Thus, this application will serve towards enhancing my technical skills in scientific
communication skills, scientific rigor and networking as I train to become an independent physician scientist."

The brain maintains energy homeostasis by integrating peripheral signals to balance food intake with energy
expenditure. This can be perturbed in chronic inflammatory states such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
resulting in anorexia. The clinical phenomenon of inflammation-associated anorexia is well-established, and
inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α
that
are elevated in patients with active IBD have been known
cause anorexia in laboratory settings for decades. However, the neural circuit-based mechanisms underlying
this phenomenon remain poorly understood. This represents a crucial knowledge gap, as targeted therapies for
inflammation-related anorexia and malnutrition are lacking. Parabrachial CGRP neurons represent a well-
defined anorexic node, decreasing food intake in response to gastrointestinal satiety signals, aversive stimuli,
and cancer progression. Here, I will determine CGRP neuron contribution to IBD-associated anorexia. In

Taken together, this proposal will test
my hypothesis that IBD-associated anorexia is mediated at least partially through CGRP neurons as an initial
step to dissecting the neuronal circuitry underlying inflammation-induced anorexia more broadly. The results of
these experiments will reveal in unprecedented detail how inflammatory signals may impact hunger circuitry in
IBD to promote anorexia. In addition to pursuing this innovative project, this proposal seeks to advance my
professional training. Specifically, I will acquire skills in calcium imaging and computer programming, engage in
formal coursework in immunology and biostatistics, and seek formal training in professional realms including
grantsmanship and leadership. Taken together, the successful completion of this proposal will prepare me for a
career as an independent academic neurologist and scientist with a research focus on how the brain maintains
homeostasis in health and how this can be disrupted in disease."
10828308,"Epilepsy is characterized by two pathological electrographic phenotypes: seizures and interictal spikes.
Seizures are relatively rare sustained elevations in brain activity or synchronization that often produce a
loss of consciousness in patients suffering from epilepsy. Interictal spikes are much more frequent (on
the order of 1 per minute), brief (~200ms), and have no behavioral phenotype (patient is typically not
aware of interictal spikes). It is well-established that epileptic networks commonly generate both types
of discharge and mounting evidence suggests that there is a direct link between interictal spikes and
seizure onset. This proposal aims to dissect the basic mechanisms of interictal spike generation, which
will offer new insight into the dynamics of epileptic neural networks (and, in turn, inform development
of novel therapeutics).
The proposed project will investigate the origins of interictal spikes using an experimentally accessible
preparation, the organotypic slice culture (which spontaneously develops interictal spikes and seizures
during its first weeks in culture), and a custom microscope (the “Incuscope”) specially designed to
record and manipulate activity with single-cell resolution, across the entire epileptic network. Imaging
the entire epileptic network guarantees that epileptiform activity observed is not driven by external
input. Furthermore, the Incuscope is built inside of a tissue culture incubator, enabling continuous,
month-long imaging as epileptic activity emerges and evolves. Findings will be validated in intact animals
using endomicroscopy-based in vivo imaging of interictal spikes.
The primary goals of this project are as follows: 1) Identify subpopulations of early-firing cells during
interictal spikes. 2) Optically stimulate early-firing cells to characterize the degree to which their
activation is sufficient to initiate spikes. 3) Optically inhibit early-firing cells to characterize the degree to
which their activation is necessary to initiate spikes. 4) Repeat experiments 1-3 in long-term (multi-
week) recordings to characterize the stability of early-firing cells and correlate observed changes with
seizure onset and seizure burden. 5) Repeat experiment 1 in awake mice, using endomicroscopy and the
intrahippocampal kainate model of epilepsy, to test whether the same population of cells is involved in
generating interictal spikes in vivo."
10828309,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Somatic mosaicism arises due to the clonal expansion of a cell with an acquired mutation, which
leads to genetically distinct sub-populations of cells in an organism derived from a single zygote. As a clone
proliferates, its subclones can accumulate further molecular changes that seed cancer. A better understanding
of acquired point mutations and copy number changes in these clonal expansions can help elucidate the
earliest stages of cancer development. Studies of tissues from healthy individuals have found that those with
clonal mosaicism in blood, specifically copy number alterations (CNAs), have a ~10-fold higher risk of
developing hematological malignancies, thus underscoring the translational potential of mosaicism studies for
the development of improved risk assessment and cancer prevention strategies. Research up to now has
mainly focused on persons of European ancestry. My own preliminary results show differences in the genomic
landscape of CNAs between individuals of African American or Latino ancestry when compared with
Europeans. Understanding these differences and the underlying molecular mechanisms is critical in order to
include these still under-researched populations in translational mosaicism studies for early detection and
prevention of hematological and potentially other cancers. Proposed Research: Aim 1 is to address the great
need for comprehensive studies of mosaicism in American minority populations through a large-scale analyses
of CNAs in African American and Latino whole genome sequencing (WGS) data sets. This approach will
enable a robust comparison of mosaicism profiles across populations; WGS will allow for joint analysis of
CNAs and somatic point mutations to gain insights into mechanisms that underlie different rates and subtypes
of hematological malignancies across populations. Aim 2 is to develop novel methods to combine CNA and
haplotype level ancestry data for detection of variants associated with increased mosaicism rates. I will use
these methods to identify genetic variants that are associated with mosaicism and with increased cancer risk in
Latinos and African Americans. Candidate: I have led projects to discover and analyze acquired CNAs in
thousands of non-malignant tissues – first of their kind studies for pathologically normal and premalignant
tissues – as well as in cancer tissues that complement these. This expertise and my established track record in
the development of computational methods for human/cancer genomics, will ensure the successful completion
of these aims. As larger volumes of normal tissues are molecularly profiled, I will be able to extend methods
developed in Aim 2 to additional normal tissue types, and conduct integrative omics analyses. I will follow up
this work and the associated publications with an R01 proposal focused on translational applications of mosaic
mutations in normal tissues as markers for cancer risk assessment, early detection, and prognosis. The K22
award will be fundamental as I launch my independent investigator career, offering management and grant
writing training, helping to hone my skills as a mentor/PI and establish a long-term funded research program."

Viruses are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) being
one of the most infectious and prevalent among them. Roughly 250 million people worldwide suffer from chronic
HBV infection, including 1-2 million in the United States. Of those infected, approximately 15-25% will develop se-
rious liver problems, including cirrhosis, cancer, and ultimately failure, leading to 600,000 deaths annually. While
therapies exist to manage chronic HBV infection, all target viral genomic processes such as reverse transcription
and DNA replication, and none provide a cure due to viral persistence and resistance. A promising orthogonal
approach to eliminating infection is to target HBV's capsid, the protein shell that encapsulates the viral genome.
The Finn laboratory has previously developed compounds that induce the misdirected assembly of non-functional
HBV capsids, showing that small molecules have the power to affect the structures of these large multi-protein
assemblies. While much is known about the structures of the intermolecular interactions with these compounds
identiﬁed after the fact, little about the dynamics of such interactions has been explored, and a predictive under-
standing of functional (antiviral) binding has yet to be developed. Both deﬁciencies will begin to be addressed in
this program. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with in vitro experiments on HepAD38 cells,
the PIs have identiﬁed seven compounds based on motifs previously unknown to interact with HBV that target the
capsid assembly process. These compounds bind in a known pocket at the interface of two capsid-protein (Cp)
dimers, possess moderate antiviral activity, and low toxicity. In the ﬁrst aim, using docking, free-energy perturba-
tion, and synthetic chemistry, the PIs will optimize the lead compound to improve its efﬁcacy against HBV. In the
second aim, using molecular dynamics simulations, advanced free-energy calculations, and experimental assays
on different HBV protein oligomers, up to and including the whole virus capsid, the PIs will determine how small
molecules interfere with capsid assembly. Both aims will beneﬁt from using a machine-learning-based classiﬁ-
cation scheme as well as novel enhanced sampling methods. The lessons learned here concerning how small
molecules can re-direct the assembly pathway into unproductive conformations can be generalized for application
to other viruses."
10932202,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The rise of social media in the lives of adolescent girls provides unprecedented opportunities to share personal
details with others. While this behavior, known as intimate self-disclosure, can engender greater closeness and
intimacy, it can also result in social rejection and invalidation, which are established risk factors for depression.
This tradeoff is all the more heightened on social media given the potential for any risks associated with one's
self-disclosure to be amplified to a scale that would not otherwise be experienced offline. The proposed project
within this NRSA F31 application will leverage prospective longitudinal data from the NIH-funded Transitions in
Adolescent Girls Study (N=174, baseline ages 10-13 years, 4 timepoints collected at 18-month intervals) and
utilize an innovative and validated neuroimaging task that measures the intrinsic value of self-disclosure to
characterize the neurobehavioral development of intimate (relative to superficial) self-disclosure and its
association with depression in adolescent girls. This project will also examine whether neurobehavioral indices
of intimate self-disclosure moderate the link between social media use and depression, especially in early
adolescent girls. Adolescent girls are experiencing a growing mental health crisis, and there is a critical need to
identify modifiable factors that are conferring increased risk for depression in this population. Intimate self-
disclosure may be a malleable behavior, particularly on social media, that can be targeted through intervention
to reduce the likelihood of experiencing depression in the context of high social media use. The overarching
objective of the proposed project is to advance our knowledge of the development of intimate self-disclosure in
adolescent girls and whether it represents a unique risk factor for depression in girls, especially in the context
of high social media use. The goals of the proposed study are to test 1) how the decision to engage in intimate
and superficial self-disclosure changes across typical adolescent development both at the neural and
behavioral level, 2) whether an atypical developmental trajectory of intimate self-disclosure may confer risk for
depression, and 3) which neurobehavioral indices of self-disclosure in conjunction with high social media use
result in depression in adolescent girls. By identifying modifiable behaviors that confer risk for depression in
the context of social media use, this project will inform future work on early prevention and intervention for
depression in adolescent girls. This fellowship encompasses three critical training goals: 1) develop expertise
in longitudinal modeling for the prediction of adolescent depression, 2) learn advanced methods for processing
and analyzing longitudinal task-based fMRI data, and 3) professional development and impactful science
communication to benefit youth and society. Completion of the research and training aims, in the context of the
strong research infrastructure and sponsorship team at the University of Oregon, the PI will greatly advance
towards her long-term goal of becoming a clinical scientist, and contributing to the science of modifiable risk
factors and treatment targets for adolescent depression."

 Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structures are abundant in the nucleus and have been implicated in
various diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, cancers, and neurological conditions like epilepsy and
Alzheimer's. However, their functional role in RNA biology remains poorly understood, representing a significant
gap in our knowledge. Our project aims to investigate the hypothesis that dsRNA presents a unique substrate in
nascent transcripts, acting as a nucleation site for context-specific functional protein complex formation. Building
on the Bass Lab's previous findings that dsRNAs are highly expressed in essential genes embedded in
heterochromatin and enriched in embryos and neurons, we will employ computational approaches, including
thermodynamics and machine learning, to identify high-confidence dsRNA-forming sequences and analyze their
spatiotemporal expression patterns throughout C. elegans development. In the next phase of our project, we will
explore the direct interaction of dsRNA binding proteins and the potential roles of secondary interacting proteins
in forming diverse double-stranded ribonucleoprotein complexes using the J2 antibody and TurboID-based
proteomics. This research will be conducted at the University of Utah Medical School under the mentorship of
Distinguished Professor Brenda Bass, who has extensive experience in training independent scientists in
biochemistry and molecular biology. The Bass Lab, within the Department of Biochemistry, provides the
necessary resources and environment for successful postdoctoral training and project completion."
10828358,"Project Abstract
Cleft palate is one of the most common congenital birth defects, with a prevalence of 1/700 live births worldwide.
Human linkage studies have shown that either genetic mutations related to cholesterol metabolism or abnormal
maternal cholesterol diets lead to craniofacial deformities such as cleft palate. However, it is largely unknown
how disturbances in cholesterol production result in cleft palate. In our preliminary studies, we found that mice
with loss of sterol-C5-desaturase (Sc5d) displayed cleft palate with complete penetrance through decreased cell
proliferation during palate formation. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling, which is crucial for normal palate
formation, was compromised in Sc5d mutant mice. The primary cilium, an antenna-like structure receiving
hedgehog signals on the plasma membrane, was deformed in palatal mesenchymal cells of Sc5d mutant mice.
We also found that posttranscriptional protein modification and expression of non-coding RNAs was altered in
the palate of Sc5d mutant mice. Interestingly, while cholesterol synthesis is inhibited similarly in mice deficient
for the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (Dhcr7) gene, which is crucial for cholesterol synthesis right after SC5D,
these mice display cleft palate with a penetrance lower than 10%. Based on this foundation, in this project we
will test the hypothesis that lathosterol, a cholesterol precursor that is elevated in Sc5d mutant mice, plays crucial
roles in the pathogenesis of cleft palate. We have three specific aims; (1) To determine how a specific cholesterol
intermediate interferes with SHH signaling by testing how lathosterol, a cholesterol intermediate accumulated in
Sc5d mutant mice, interferes with hedgehog receptor movement and primary cilium formation; (2) To identify
altered proteins and modifications in the developing palate of Sc5d mutant mice by conducting proteomic
analyses using the palate of Sc5d mutant, Dhcr7 mutant, and control mice; (3) To identify non-coding RNAs and
their regulated genes influenced by impaired cholesterol metabolism through analysis of the regulatory
mechanism(s) of microRNAs (short non-coding RNAs) and their regulation of genes associated with cleft palate
that are specifically altered in Sc5d mutant mice. Building on our strong preliminary work, we expect this study
will systematically investigate the roles of cholesterol metabolism (at the cellular, metabolic, proteomic, and post-
transcriptional regulation levels) in cleft palate in mice, and the results will lead to innovations in the prevention,
diagnosis, and treatment of cholesterol-related craniofacial birth defects."

Neuroscience is among the fastest growing area of science and has produced remarkable developments that
will have profound implications for the understanding and treatment of mental disorders. Innovations and
advancements in molecular genetics, brain imaging methods, molecular biology and have resulted in
unprecedented advances that have extended visions of understanding and treating psychiatric disorders to the
hope of preventing and even curing them. However, there is still a gap in applying knowledge and tools to
psychiatric disorders that is due, in part, to a shortage of clinical and translational-science researchers.
Consequently, it is imperative train researchers to translate important basic science findings into clinically

10828450,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurological disorder associated with a broad collection of
genetic mutations and environmental factors. While identifying the neural underpinnings of ASD has been a
major focus in the field of genetics and neuroscience, it is not clear which brain region (s) and cell types may be
functioning abnormally to give rise to ASD. The cerebellum, a brain region typically considered to be involved in
motor coordination and control, has received considerable attention for its potential role in ASD, with a growing
body of clinical evidence correlating ASD diagnoses with abnormalities in cerebellar anatomy, function, and
motor or vestibular behaviors/functions. In parallel, cerebellar involvement in circuits outside of the motor system
provides a substrate for the cerebellum to influence non-motor behaviors and processes, setting the stage for
the importance of appropriate cerebellar function in a host of neural processes. Within the cerebellum, the initial
integration of all incoming sensorimotor information entering the cerebellar cortex is carried out by the
morphologically simple and extremely dense population of granule cells. These granule cells also express many
high risk ASD-linked genes, especially those involved in synaptic transmission and development. However, little
is known about the role and importance of many ASD-linked genes in the cerebellum, especially in granule cells.
It is also not clear what aspects of cerebellar granule cell function and connectivity may be important for shaping
certain non-motor (and motor) behaviors. To address this knowledge gap, in aims 1 and 2 we propose to identify
the degree to which an ASD-linked gene determines properties of cerebellar granule cell synaptic interactions
and cortical circuitry dynamics over time. In Aim 3, we will identify how a particular ASD-linked gene in cerebellar
granule cells influence behavioral phenotype across motor and non-motor domains. Results from the proposed
work will be key in identifying a mechanistic link between a gene/protein linked to ASD and specific synaptic
abnormalities in the cerebellum."

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphic alleles are the main genetic determinants of AD risk. An unexplored
function of ApoE in AD pathobiology is that of its role in immune modulation and susceptibility to viral infection.
T cells that initially encounter antigen in the periphery can enter the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via the systemic
circulation. However, the antigens underlying this process are not clear. Preliminary data shown here
demonstrates a peripheral adaptive immune signature of AD characterized by an increased number of CD8
effector T cells. Our data further indicates APOE allele-dependent differences in CD8 T effector cell numbers in
AD blood. Strikingly, CD8 effector T cells were also present in patient CSF and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing
indicates their clonal expansion against the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BZLF1 antigen. Further, analysis of CSF
TCR sequences indicates increased CD8 T effector cell clonal expansion against EBV in APOE4 carriers. These
results indicate that antigen-experienced T cells patrol the intrathecal space of brains affected by AD in an APOE
allele-specific manner. We hypothesize that CD8 T cells patrol the blood and CSF of APOE4 AD patients and
contribute to neuroinflammation via aberrant anti-viral antigen control. Specific Aim 1 will utilize single cell RNA
sequencing (scRNAseq) and immunohistochemistry to determine the influence of APOE alleles on adaptive
immunity in the AD brain. Specific Aim 2 will use high throughput scRNAseq to assess B and T cell clonal
expansion in peripheral blood of various APOE carriers combined with sophisticated bioinformatic approaches
to compare the transcriptomes of anti-viral adaptive immune cells in an APOE allele-dependent manner.
Specific Aim 3 will employ ApoE structure correctors and CRISPR gene editing to determine the mechanistic
impact of ApoE on the anti-viral immune response and T cell killing of neurons. These studies will be conducted
in the lab of Dr. David Gate, an early-stage investigator who has extensive experience studying T cells, anti-viral
immunity and neurodegeneration. Collaborators include Dr. Robert Mahley (Gladstone Institute), who has
expertise in ApoE biology, Dr. Robert Vassar (Northwestern University), who has expertise in AD pathobiology,
and Dr. Marsel Mesulam, who will provide access to patient specimens through the Northwestern Mesulam
Center for Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease."
10828457,"PROJECT SUMMARY
My central vision is to understand how glycation functions as an early nutrient sensing mechanism that
links cellular metabolic state to protein function. Glycation is an evolutionarily conserved non-enzymatic
protein modification but its biological significance has not been established. Broadly, it describes the covalent
addition of glucose and related sugar-derived metabolites on to proteins. Moreover, while the forward reaction
is free of enzymes, distinct de-glycating enzymes FN3K and DJ-1 catalyze the removal of these so-called “sugar
adducts”. Glycation is an under-served area in physiology and medicine and until recently it was perceived as a
passive marker and non-specific protein damage associated with hyperglycemia. Conversely, my recent findings
together with other studies allude to a more dynamic role of glycation in nutrient signaling and gene regulation.
I have been building upon these to develop a research program focused on understanding the biological
implications of this new protein mark, particularly in the context of normal and aberrant sugar metabolism. I
hypothesize that glycation is an ancient mechanism that adjusts protein function and cell behavior in response
to nutrient availability. The main challenge in addressing this hypothesis is the lack of sensitive proteomics
approaches to study this protein modification. Here, we will implement a high-resolution isotope labeling and
affinity enrichment based advanced proteomics strategy to first gain mechanistic insights into glycation and
deglycation, including their target preference, stoichiometry, and reaction kinetics. Next, we will apply this to
understand the role of glycation in differentially regulating proteins under distinct metabolic conditions. In
particular, we will focus on highly “glycatable” proteins within our pre-ranked “high priority pathways” that
emerged from my recent low-resolution glycation profiling and includes translation initiation and elongation
factors, metabolic proteins, and histones. Upon successful completion, we anticipate to have i) identified
similarities and differences in key protein targets of FN3K and DJ-1 sensitive glycation, ii) distinguished early,
intermediate, and late glycation and corresponding deglycation targets, both proteins and specific amino acids
within, iii) established relationship between glycation, glucose influx, and metabolism, and iv) interrogated its
role in affirmative metabolic adaptation by regulating our “high priority pathways”. This will have significant
medical implications because the de-glycating enzymes are highly amenable to small molecule inhibition. To
that end, our findings will lay a strong foundation and provide the necessary scientific impetus to develop new
inhibitors of deglycation. Importantly, beyond having clinical applications for metabolic and age-related disorders
like diabetes, de-glycation therapies may also have a place in cancer treatment. In summary, my lab is uniquely
equipped to undertake this challenge that will have break new grounds in our understanding of metabolic protein
regulation and generate metadata that will drive future hypothesis-driven and clinically important glycation
research."
10826199,"Project Summary/Abstract
The brain uses two strategies to make decisions. Goal-directed decision making relies on prospective consideration
of potential outcomes and consequences, using learned action-outcome associations. On the other hand, habits
are reflexive behaviors executed without forethought of their consequences. Goal-directed learning is more flexible,
but cognitively taxing. Habits require less cognitive control but are relatively inflexible. Balance between these two
processes allows behavior to be adaptive when needed, but efficient when appropriate. Dysfunction in this balance
or an overreliance on habits causes maladaptive decision making that characterizes substance use disorder and
other psychiatric conditions. Despite the importance to understanding adaptive and maladaptive decision making,
little is known about the neural circuitry that supports action-outcome learning and habit formation.
 Recent research in rodents and humans has implicated midbrain dopamine neuron activity in both goal-directed
and habit learning. Midbrain dopamine neurons burst fire to unexpected rewards. This signal has been interpreted
as the prediction error term needed for habit formation. Recently, dopamine neurons also been found to be involved
in aspects of goal-directed learning. It is currently unknown how dopamine could support these two, opposing forms
of learning. One way dopamine might achieve this multifaceted function is through projections to subregions of the
amygdala. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has long been known to be involved in goal-directed learning and the
central amygdala (CeA) has been implicated in habit formation. Both BLA and CeA receive direct inputs from the
lateral ventral tegmental dopamine neurons (VTADA). I will conduct critical, in depth, and hypothesis-driven
investigation of the contribution of dopaminergic projections to the basolateral amygdala and central amygdala and
their contributions to goal-directed and habit learning. I will receive training in cell-type and projection-specific
optogenetic manipulation, fiber photometry dopamine monitoring, and behavioral procedures root in learning theory
to diagnose the content of learning and decision strategies. In Aim 1, I will apply in vivo fiber photometry imaging
and optogenetic manipulation during a sophisticated behavioral paradigm to characterize the function of the
VTADABLA pathway and its necessity for action-outcome goal-directed learning. In Aim 2, I will also apply in vivo
fiber photometry dopamine imaging and optogenetic manipulation to uncover the function of VTADACeA pathway
and its necessity for habit formation. Completing this project at UCLA ensures I will have access to a highly
collaborative network of leading neuroscientists to receive project feedback and training. This award will provide
training to help launch me into an independent career role studying maladaptive decision making and its
implications for addiction."

The Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology (BCMB) Graduate Program has trained more than 700
scientists since 1972. BCMB serves as the major training program for seven basic science departments at the
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and is one of the oldest multidisciplinary graduate programs in the
country. There are 100 faculty members actively involved in research, teaching and as mentors. The
Departments that participate in the program are Biological Chemistry, Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry,
Cell Biology, Molecular Biology and Genetics, Neuroscience, Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, and
Physiology. An average of 22 students matriculate each year and obtain their Ph.D. in an average of 5.7 years.
The objectives of the BCMB program are: (1) to provide a broad and deep science curriculum; (2) to provide
longitudinal training in rigorous, reproducible and responsible experimental research; (3) to provide training in
professional skills; (4) to provide activities for trainees to explore career options; and (5) to recruit and support a
diverse student population in an inclusive environment. These objectives will be met through a rigorous
curriculum covering the first year of study that includes courses focused on macromolecules (energetics,
structure and function), molecular biology and genomics, genetics, organic mechanisms in biology, cell structure
and dynamics, and pathways and regulation. There is a new strong emphasis on bioinformatics and
computational skills throughout the coursework. There are multiple paper discussion courses extending from
years 1 through 3 to support training in rigorous and reproducible research. There are discussion courses that
focus on responsible conduct of research, in addition to department-based workshops as students advance in
their thesis work. Oral and written presentation skills are developed throughout training through workshops
targeting different specific tasks (oral exams, chalk talks, manuscript and proposal writing). Professional
development and career planning is an integral part of the program, occurring through workshops and courses
throughout the training period, as well as diverse internship offerings. Most students publish multiple research
papers and the training concludes with presentation of a public seminar and submission of the doctoral thesis.
BCMB graduates hold leadership positions at all levels of academia, government and industry. The success of
our students is fostered by an extraordinary level of collaboration and interaction among the faculty and trainees.
Special emphasis is placed on applying conceptual breakthroughs in basic science to problems relevant to
human health and disease. Here we request 25 training grant slots to appoint training grant eligible students
during their first two years in the program."
10861899,"Project Summary/Abstract
High quality (pre)clinical research relies on the use of high quality biospecimens; without the latter it is
impossible to have the former. Unfortunately, cancer-relevant clinical analytes from all major biomolecular
classes exhibit instability when the plasma or serum (P/S) in which they reside is temporarily exposed to
thawed conditions (i.e., temperatures > -30 °C). Though the percentage of biomolecules that exhibit instability
under commonly encountered thawed conditions is generally low (e.g. 2-20%), the number of genuine
biomarkers waiting to be discovered is orders of magnitude lower—meaning that in mistreated samples the
number of false leads (i.e., potential false discoveries) is orders of magnitude greater than the number of bona
fide biomarkers waiting to be found. For this reason, every year, poor pre-analytical sample handling and
storage generate unacceptably large numbers of costly false leads in biomedical research. Unsurprisingly,
experts in the field agree that this problem must be minimized immediately.
Under NCI (IMAT) support (R33CA217702) we recently developed a simple, inexpensive, rapid assay requiring
10 µL of P/S known as ΔS-Cys-Albumin that provides an estimate of the amount of time that archived plasma
or serum samples have spent at the equivalent of room temperature. This assay works very well but it requires
an expensive liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer (LC-MS) instrument and user expertise to run it. The
need for LC-MS limits its availability to most biomedical research labs which further dis-incentivizes its use
beyond the limited incentives that most investigators already have to conduct quality control (QC) analysis on
their P/S samples. Fortuitously, we have discovered that the ex vivo biochemistry that governs the ΔS-Cys-
Albumin marker can be accessed via plate reader-based absorbance or fluorescence measurements.
Converting the ΔS-Cys-Albumin assay to a plate reader-based format would put P/S QC at the fingertips of
nearly all biomedical research scientists. As such, the goal of this project is to develop and analytically validate
plate reader-based absorbance and fluorescence assays that effectively substitute for the ΔS-Cys-Albumin
assay. This will be done via two Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Develop plate reader-based absorbance and fluorescence assays that, by quantifying low
molecular weight thiol and disulfide-bearing molecules in P/S, will be able to detect exposure of plasma and
serum specimens to thawed conditions (i.e., temperatures > -30 °C).
Specific Aim 2: A) Analytically characterize the assays and perform an initial analytical validation of them. B)
Conduct a small population survey of fresh P/S samples and time course aliquots thereof from GI cancer
patients and cancer-free age/gender matched controls to begin to link these assays to P/S exposure time to
thawed conditions at -20 °C, 4 °C, and 23 °C."

Despite years of research, there is no diagnostic test for post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS);
there is no consensus treatment for PTLDS; there is no agreement on the mechanisms causing disease or
even how frequently it happens. And while there have been intriguing findings by many outstanding
researchers, they have not been independently confirmed and have mostly been done in small populations that
have identified PTLDS patients retrospectively without serial follow up after the diagnosis of acute Lyme
disease. It is highly unlikely that there will be a breakthrough in understanding the disease without a major
change in the way we approach studying the disease.
We hypothesize that one of the reasons why PTLDS has been so intractable to understand is that the causes
are multifactorial and involve a confluence of events including prior/concurrent exposures, immunological
responses and specific bacterial characteristics. In this case, researchers examining only one potential aspect
of the disease are unlikely to uncover the full complexity of the origins of disease. We are proposing a
prospective study of PTLDS, enrolling and following subjects from the time they are diagnosed with acute
Lyme disease until they recover or develop PTLDS. We have assembled a unique team of clinicians,
epidemiologists, immunologists, microbiologists and statisticians with a deep understanding of Lyme disease
and a history of collaboration to tackle the understanding of PTLDS together. Subjects will undergo a battery
of tests, taking advantage of new technologies allowing unbiased analysis of both human immune and
bacterial factors. These high-throughput tests will be supplemented with focused testing of hypotheses that
have arisen through prior research, by our group as well as others. Though these studies we will understand
the differences in co-infections with other tick-borne diseases, specific inflammatory patterns, distribution of cell
types and their reactions, autoantibody formation, auto-reacting T cells, antibiotic resistance and persistence of
B. burgdorferi, binding and dissemination of B. burgdorferi strains and shedding of peptidoglycan between
patients with PTLDS and RLD. In addition, as part of this process, we will also be developing one of the
largest, well characterized specimen banks that will be shared with the research community for additional
testing in a way that results can be aggregated to continually broaden our understanding of PTLDS.
Our highly experienced group is operating under no illusions about how difficult and complex this study will be
to complete. However, we believe that this type of effort is needed to move the field-- which is essentially no
closer to a consensus understanding of PTLDS today that it was 30 years ago-- and to make progress for the
health of the afflicted patients."

Spatial organization of the genome, nucleome and transcriptome is key to their control of many essential
genomic and cellular functions. Yet existing tools limit our ability to identify regulators of these spatial
organizations. We are developing a high-content, image-based CRISPR screen to discover three-dimensional
(3D) genome regulators, a first-in-kind technology to uncover the regulatome of 3D genome architectures
across multiple length scales. Our proof-of-concept screen targeting hundreds of candidate regulators
identified many novel chromatin organization regulators. The goal of this application is to advance our
technology to develop a highly-efficient, large scale, and multi-omic screening platform to discover the
molecular regulators of the spatial genome, nucleome and transcriptome. In Aim 1, we will develop a
generalizable, large scale screening platform compatible with in situ spatial omics techniques. In Aim 2, we will
develop multimodal detection and perturbation methods for comprehensive large scale screens of 3D
nucleome regulators. In Aim 3, we will develop integrative methods for large scale screens of spatial
transcriptome phenotypes to allow efficient discovery of the regulatory mechanisms of subcellular RNA
transport and localization. We expect that these proposed developments will provide the research field with
brand-new, broadly applicable technologies for mechanistic studies of the spatial genome, nucleome and
transcriptome in a wide range of biomedical contexts."

Digital technology and screen media have become increasingly ubiquitous in the lives of young children,
fueling urgent calls for better understanding how screen media use impacts child development and mental
health. Emerging research has suggested associations between child media use and child emotional and
behavioral difficulties, including problems with attention, self-regulation, and disruptive behavior, and some
evidence further suggests that early behavioral functioning may also predict later screen media use. However,
the nature of the association between early screen media use and child emotional and behavioral functioning
remains under debate due to inconsistent findings, limited availability of robust long-term studies, and a lack of
understanding regarding the underlying mechanisms driving these effects. Additionally, much of the existing
research on early screen media use and child development has been limited to considering only a child's
overall exposure to screen media (i.e., duration of screen media use), disregarding crucial contextual factors,
such as, content, purpose, and caregiver media use, that are essential for clarifying how early screen media
use impacts (and is impacted by) young children's emotional and behavioral functioning. To address these
gaps, we propose to follow an existing cohort of 200 children and their caregivers, who were previously
enrolled in an NICHD-funded randomized trial for infants at-risk for externalizing behavior problems. The
primary aims of this R01 application are to investigate transactional associations between characteristics of
family media use and developmental trajectories of early child emotional and behavioral functioning, and to
investigate caregiver-child interactions, parenting, and caregiver distress as key mechanisms of these
associations. Measures of parenting, caregiver-child interactions, and child functioning, as well as screen
media use, were administered in the prior trial when children were 1-2 years old. We propose to follow these
caregiver-child dyads yearly from age 3 years to kindergarten entry (age 5 years). Specifically, we will examine
family screen media use (including duration of parent and child media use, content, purposes of use, co-use),
caregiver-child interactions, child behavior and self-regulation, and caregiver wellbeing at each time point via
robust, noninvasive, and validated means. Using growth curve modeling, we will investigate 1) transactional
associations between family media use and child self-regulation and behavior, 2) longitudinal associations
between family media use and caregiver-child interactions, and whether a brief parenting intervention
moderates these associations, and 3) caregiver-child interactions and caregiver distress as mediators. The
proposed study responds to NICHD priorities to investigate impacts of early exposure to technology and digital
media on caregiver-child interactions and child outcomes, and the results of the proposed research will help
inform healthy family media use guidelines and interventions that are relevant to modern digital age."

Significance: Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a devastating trauma that leaves approximately 10,000 to 20,000
people paralyzed every year in the U.S., costing the health care system $40.5 billion annually. Although it has
been shown that the inflammatory response after SCI is beneficial in removing debris and releasing neurotrophic
factors, there is an overreaction of the inflammatory response causing further neural destruction and
inflammatory macrophages remain for a prolonged time period. Using anti-inflammatory cytokines to attenuate
inflammation after SCI has shown some encouraging results. However, there are several limitations that need
to be overcome to use anti-inflammatory cytokines as a treatment for SCI including, a short half-life, inability
to cross the blood spinal cord barrier, rapid clearancefrom the injury site, and higher risk of infection when using
large systemic doses. Therefore, it would be beneficial to have a local sustained delivery of anti-inflammatory
cytokines, coinciding with critical stages of the ensuing inflammatory response.
Innovation: Emerging cytokine delivery approaches are often limited by sub-optimal release characteristics
and poor biological activity of the cytokine when delivered in vivo. We hypothesize that: mineral coated
microparticles (MCMs) releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines can be injected at clinically relevant treatment
times after SCI, which will reduce inflammation coinciding with critical stages of the ensuing secondary
damage resulting in smaller lesions and a higher level of function retained after SCI. We have preliminary data
showing that IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 retain their bioactivity when bound to MCMs and are capable of reducing
inflammation after SCI. Our preliminary results also show a clear synergistic effect at reducing inflammation
when using the combination of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13.
Aims: The proposed plan is to 1) optimize IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 dosage in a rat contusionmodel; 2) test the
influence MCMs delivering IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 have on immune cells during important stages of
inflammation and glial scar development; and 3) explore the influence a sustained release of IL-4, IL-10, and
IL-13 has on reducing inflammation and improving the amount of function retained below the level of injury
after SCI.
Impact: Successful completion of the proposed research will produce three direct outcomes. First, it will
establish a method to attenuate inflammation after SCI using locally delivered biologically active anti-
inflammatory cytokines with optimized dosage. Second, it will explore fundamental synergies between
cytokines that influence specific stages of inflammation. Third, it will develop a controllable drug delivery
system for biologically active molecules after SCI. In view of the importance of soluble cytokines involved in the
inflammatory response after SCI, as well as growth factors for signaling and guidance cues for axonal growth,
the proposed MCMs are expected to be a uniquely enabling technology in neural tissue engineering."

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disease that affects 15-30% of children worldwide
and is characterized by dry, pruritic, and eczematous skin lesions that diminish quality of life. In addition, AD
predisposes to other allergic comorbidities including asthma and food allergy that impose considerable morbidity
and a significant public health burden. AD is associated with a dysfunctional skin barrier with reduced skin
structural protein filaggrin (FLG) expression, Th2 immune dysregulation and microbial dysbiosis including
increased Staphylococcus aureus (SA) prevalence. However, current standards of care aimed at reducing SA
colonization on AD skin have exhibited minimal benefits and various unintended side effects. Therefore, there is
a critical need to elucidate microbial colonization patterns and drivers of SA persistence in early life to guide the
development of novel targeted therapies aimed at regulating the microbiome. We are uniquely equipped to
address this need by utilizing our established MPAACH (The Mechanisms of Progression of Atopic Dermatitis to
Asthma in Children) cohort, the first US-based early-life cohort of children with AD, which includes contact plates
and tape strips sampling for microbial data and extensive clinical data at each annual visit. Our novel preliminary
studies on the non-lesional skin of MPAACH participants demonstrate: (a) vast microbial diversity on the AD skin
surface; (b) an association of persistent SA colonization with increased AD severity, allergen sensitization and
low FLG expression; (c) an association of specific SA genes, including lipoprotein-like lipoprotein (lpl) cluster
genes, with low FLG expression; and (d) decreased adhesion to keratinocytes in SA lacking the lpl gene cluster,
especially in the context of low FLG expression and Th2 cytokines. Together, our findings and existing literature
inform our central hypothesis that severe AD will be associated with decreased global microbial diversity,
evenness, and richness over time and that persistently SA colonized AD children harbor SA with strain-
specific genes that induce increased keratinocyte adhesion, inflammation, and barrier dysfunction.
Using additional samples from non-lesional skin over multiple annual visits, we propose to test this hypothesis
by (i) identifying longitudinal microbial and SA colonization patterns on non-invasive skin tapes (Aim 1), (ii)
identifying SA genes involved in binding to AD skin (Aim 2) and (iii) identifying the mechanisms of SA adhesion
and invasion on WT and FLG deficient primary human keratinocytes (Aim 3). Our studies will enhance our
understanding of microbial patterns and identify mechanisms of SA adhesion, invasion and persistence over
time in early life. More broadly, these studies will give crucial insight into novel therapeutic targets to mitigate
skin dysbiosis and attenuate disease severity, which may have biological and clinical significance that extends
far beyond AD."
10928744,"Abstract: The inferior colliculus (IC) is the midbrain hub of the auditory system and is important for the
processing of speech and other vocalizations. T-stellate neurons provide the only direct projection from the
anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) to the IC and have been implicated in the processing of vocalization
cues since they encode information about sound frequency and amplitude modulations (AM). However, how T-
stellate cells influence specific populations of IC neurons and how they shape speech and vocalization coding
in the IC is unknown. One barrier to studying T-stellate input to the IC has been a lack of molecular markers for
IC neuron classes. Recently, we overcame this barrier by identifying two novel classes of IC neurons:
glutamatergic VIP neurons and GABAergic NPY neurons. Together, VIP and NPY neurons represent ~55-75%
of stellate cells within the central nucleus of the IC. Using channelrhodopsin assisted circuit mapping and
fluorescence-targeted whole cell recordings in brain slices, our preliminary data show that both VIP and NPY
neurons receive functional synaptic input from T-stellate cells. Interestingly, the excitatory postsynaptic
potentials (EPSPs) evoked by T-stellate input to NPY neurons are larger in amplitude than those evoked in VIP
neurons. In addition, optogenetic activation of T-stellate terminals can elicit feedforward inhibition in both NPY
and VIP neurons, suggesting that T-stellate afferents can recruit local inhibitory circuits in the IC. To investigate
how T-stellate cells influence frequency tuning and AM selectivity in the IC, we will make in-vivo single-unit
recordings from IC neurons before and after silencing T-stellate inputs using chemogenetics with the inhibitory
receptor hM4Di. In preliminary experiments, we have validated our chemogenetic approach by showing that
co-expression of hM4Di and the excitatory opsin Chronos in T-stellate cells enables us to reduce the amplitude
of light-evoked EPSPs in IC neurons with an hM4Di agonist. The overall objective of this proposal is to
determine differences in the prevalence, dynamics, and pharmacology of T-stellate cell inputs to NPY and VIP
neurons, and to determine how T-stellate input influences frequency tuning and AM coding in vivo. In Aim 1,
we will determine the prevalence, short-term plasticity, and receptor pharmacology of T-stellate input to NPY
and VIP neurons in vitro using whole cell recordings in IC slices. In Aim 2, we will determine how T-stellate
neurons shape frequency tuning and AM coding in the IC by selectively inhibiting T-stellate with
chemogenetics while recording from IC neurons. The expected results will provide direct evidence about how a
specific source of ascending input to the IC supports the processing of auditory cues that are important for
understanding speech and other vocalizations."

In the cellular system, mitochondria form an intricate network of interconnected mitochondrion of
different shapes and sizes. The mitochondrion forms close contact with other cellular organelles
which are essential in maintaining the mitochondrial integrity as well as the functions. Emerging
evidence suggests the complexity of the mitochondrial architecture and processes involved in
the maintenance of functional mitochondrial pool in the cell. The mitochondrial architecture is
regulated by various pathophysiological signals like nutrient availability, hormonal regulation,
and stress conditions which regulates cytosolic calcium (cCa2+) dynamics as well. The dynamic
changes in the cCa2+ regulate mitochondrial shape through a Ca2+-sensing mitochondrial outer
membrane-anchored EF-hand containing protein Miro1. This phenomenon termed as the
mitochondrial shape transition (MiST) is independent of Miro1's role in mitochondrial trafficking
and Drp1-induced mitochondrial fission. Although Ca2+ signals fine-tune the mitochondrial
bioenergetic output, and sustained elevation of cCa2+ drives excessive mitochondrial Ca2+
uptake which is a prerequisite for the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore
(MPTP), mitochondrial swelling, plasma membrane rupture, and necrotic cell death. Preliminary
data suggest that in response to MiST, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrial tethering is
increased which may be essential for both MPTP opening and the mitophagic response. In
response to hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), MPTP opening leads to the onset of
hepatic necrosis and subsequent organ failure. Mitochondrial integrity is crucial for hepatic
function and survival after IRI. However, the underlying molecular mechanism for the
maintenance of mitochondrial integrity is largely unidentified. Therefore,we will mechanistically
examinethe link betweenMiST, MPTP, and mitophagy with a particular emphasis on the role of
Miro1 in MPTP formation, initiation of mitophagy, and induction of necrosis in response to the
hepatic IRI. The project outline will enable the development of essential skills and expertise
needed to develop PI's independent research program focusing on the mitochondrial biology in
the hepatic system."
10827922,"Chronic sleep disruption, resulting from work schedules, noise exposure, family obligations, sleep disorders, or
lifestyle choices, is a pervasive feature of contemporary life. Sleep problems affect up to 40% of AD patients,
may precede cognitive impairments by more than a decade, and worsen as the disease progresses. As well as
affecting mood and well-being, sleep disruption may drive the development of AD neuropathology for instance,
by reducing clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) and by promoting a neurotoxic proinflammatory state involving
astrocytes and microglia. Sleep disruption can include reduced total sleep (sleep restriction [SR]), loss of deep
sleep (also known as slow-wave sleep [SWS], marked by large amplitude, low frequency electrical activity),
and fragmentation of sleep (SF) into shorter bouts. Fragmentation of the daily sleep-wake rhythm is associated
with greater risk of incident AD and earlier cognitive decline in older humans. In spite of these correlative
studies, whether or how chronic SF impacts the progression of AD has not been experimentally investigated.
SF may be a better model of the sleep disruption associated with AD than the traditional approach of SR. Our
studies of AD mouse models show that spontaneously occurring SF is associated with more severe Aβ
accumulation and that experimentally-induced SF leads to Aβ accumulation and neuroinflammation. Besides
SF, loss of SWS may exacerbate AD, and improving SWS may be beneficial in mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) or even in AD. Since sleep disruption adversely affects the development of AD-related neuropathology, it
is surprising that sleep enhancement (SE) strategies to consolidate sleep and increase SWS have not been
adequately explored to slow or reverse these effects. Our overall working hypothesis is that a change in the
quality of sleep, especially sleep fragmentation and loss of SWS, is more important than the quantity of sleep.
Further, we hypothesize that the mechanism underlying these effects is primarily neuroinflammation, at least in
part mediated by Aβ peptide deposition. We will use a unique, well-characterized mouse model, that exhibits
AD-related Aβ pathology, neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits. This project has three specific aims: (1)
that SF will accelerate (and SE decelerate) AD progression; (2) that increases in Aβ accumulation mediates
SF-induced neuroinflammation, neuropathology, and cognitive decline; and (3) that increases in
neuroinflammation mediate SF-induced neuropathology and cognitive decline. We will use multiple novel
approaches, including thermoneutral temperature manipulation, and a unique anti-inflammatory compound that
has recently entered early stage clinical trials. Thus, these studies will elucidate the underlying mechanisms by
which sleep disruption is linked to AD and will lay the groundwork for new therapeutic strategies."
10827923,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with an ineffective T cell response that fails to control the
virus. While the precise mechanism of T cell dysfunction in chronic hepatitis B is not well understood, prior
studies using blood and liver tissue from acute and chronic HBV patients have identified a number of critical
immunological mechanisms that may contribute to this poor immune response. These mechanisms include the
killing of HBV-specific T cells by liver-resident natural killer (NK) cells, a general tolerogenic environment in the
liver that is manifested by immunosuppressive immune cells, cytokines, and metabolic pathways, and the loss
of T cell function through inhibitory receptor signaling pathways and exhaustion. The study of HBV-host
interactions and the development of new curative immunotherapies for chronic hepatitis B have been hampered
by the lack of physiological animal models for chronic infection. A new mouse model of HBV replication was
recently described that is based on adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated transduction of the liver with the
HBV genome, which leads to persistent virus replication and immune tolerance to HBV antigens. Compared to
other mouse models of HBV replication, the AAV-HBV model has important advantages, including physiological
intrahepatic immune priming, technical ease and reproducibility, peripheral T and B cell tolerance to HBV, and
the ability to study virus elimination from the liver. Using this model, we will test the hypothesis that HBV
therapeutic vaccine efficacy can be enhanced by manipulating mechanisms of immune dysfunction to promote
viral clearance. Our general approach will be to combine AAV-HBV transduction with genetically modified mice
and antibody-mediated depletion/blockade to evaluate the importance of immune cells, cytokines, and regulatory
pathways for eliciting functional CD8+ T cell responses and controlling HBV following therapeutic immunization.
To evaluate our hypothesis, we will carry out three specific aims. First, we will assess the inhibition of HBV-
specific T cells by NK cells. Second, we will define the role of regulatory cells, cytokines, and metabolic pathways.
Third, we will evaluate T cell inhibitory receptor function and exhaustion. The knowledge that will be gained from
this research will impact the field in two important ways. First, it will provide new mechanistic insight into the
relationship between T cell dysfunction and HBV persistence, and form a strong foundation for future studies
using the AAV-HBV model to better understand the virus-host interactions that are observed in humans. Second,
it will reveal new immunotherapeutic targets for potential approaches to cure chronic HBV infection."
10827924,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adoptive T-cell immunotherapies and, in particular, chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CART) generated
unprecedented responses in patients with highly refractory CD19+ B cell malignancies. However, only a limited
number of patients treated with anti-CD19 CART will experience prolonged remission while most patients either
do not respond or eventually relapse. Moreover, in the setting of solid cancers, CART cells have generally been
disappointing. Increasing CART effector function against cancer would represent a vertical improvement in the
field of adoptive T-cell immunotherapy. In this proposal, we aim at increasing the anti-tumor efficacy of CAR T
cells by reducing the inhibition of CAR activation. Current approaches to enhance CART efficacy focus on
reducing long-term T cell exhaustion by targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. However, there is a lack of investigation
on strategies to enhance early CAR and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, which is critical for effective tumor killing,
especially in the setting of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. To this goal, we studied the
scavenger receptor CD5. CD5 associates with the TCR complex and inhibits its activation through several
mediators, including SHP-1, CBL, CBL-B, and GRB2. The central hypothesis of this grant is that CD5 deletion
increases the anti-tumor efficacy of engineered T cells through enhancement of TCR signaling. In our preliminary
work, we have found that CRISPR-Cas9 CD5 knock out in CART cells enhances their anti-tumor activity in
xenograft models of B-cell leukemia (CART19) and T-cell lymphoma (CART5). Moreover, we demonstrated that,
upon stimulation, CD5 knocked-out CART cells show higher phosphorylation of key CAR signaling mediators as
compared to wild-type. In Aim#1, we will test the hypothesis that the deletion of CD5 in T cells broadly enhances
the anti-tumor efficacy of adoptive T-cell immunotherapies, by studying CD5 knockout in the setting of CAR T
cells for solid tumors. In Aim#2, we will test the hypothesis that CD5 deletion augments T-cell anti-tumor activity
by disinhibiting CAR signaling by performing in vitro and in vivo mechanistic studies. We will also test the safety
of this approach. This hypothesis-driven proposal is highly innovative as it proposes the study of a novel
immunomodulatory target - CD5 - and uses cutting edge technologies like digital spatial profiling and single-cell
RNA sequencing to investigate CD5 deleted CAR T-cell in vivo in both human and murine models. A successful
outcome of the proposed investigations is expected to impact the field of cancer immunotherapy significantly,
providing a rational and generalizable approach to improving T-cell immunotherapies and ultimately drive the
development of a first-in-human clinical trial of CD5 knocked-out CART for refractory cancers."

protein glycosylation that functionally regulates thousands of proteins in response to nutrients and stress.
Aberrant functions of OGA have been detected in numerous diseases including cancer and neurodegeneration,
fostering intense interest in OGA as a therapeutic target. However, due to the lack of complete OGA structure
and the paucity of information on its substrate recognition, little is known about how OGA can accommodate
such a broad range of substrates without a consensus sequence motif, while still maintaining certain level of
specificity. Our preliminary studies provide strong evidence suggesting that OGA’s non-catalytic regions play
critical roles in substrate binding and new functions that we are just beginning to reveal. We propose to advance
structural and functional investigation of OGA. The new findings from this study will help decode OGA’s complex
cellular regulation and will serve as a critical foundation for manipulating the precise role of OGA, paving the way
for development of more effective and safer therapies for challenging diseases."

Lymphatic malformations (LM) are a common vascular malformation of the head and neck in children, affecting
1-in-4000 live births. LM of the head and neck can be disfiguring and cause life-threatening dysfunction,
including airway obstruction and impaired swallowing and speech. LM are caused by defective morphogenesis
of lymphatic vessels and surrounding tissue overgrowth due to post-zygotic activating mutations in the
oncogene PIK3CA. Interestingly, less than 10% of cells in LM are mutant. Data on how such a small number of
mutant cells produce bulky, complex LM are lacking, but localized, intralesional paracrine signaling must play a
role.
The experiments proposed here aim to elucidate LM pathophysiology using a combination of spatial
transcriptomics and in situ single cell genotyping. We will use NanoString to obtain high-throughput spatial
analysis of RNA and protein expression data for different cell types and regions of interest in LM tissue.
Although we expect to find evidence of PI3K-AKT pathway hyperactivation in both lymphatic endothelial cells
(LECs) and LEC-adjacent cells, we hypothesize that gene expression programs will vary based on LEC
proximity. We also propose the use of STAR-FISH (specific-to-allele PCR–FISH) in situ genotyping to define
the mutation status on a single cell level in the context of LM architecture. We hypothesize that while LECs will
represent the main class of mutant cells, there will be non-LECs containing PIK3CA mutations, and mutant cell
distribution will correlate with regions that demonstrate pathway hyperactivation.
Understanding the spatial expression programs and genetic heterogeneity in LM will inform the molecular
impact of a single activated oncogene on LM formation and persistence, thus guiding further development and
utilization of targeted therapies for these and other vascular malformations. Knowledge from this investigation
has broad implications for understanding other mosaic disorders and tumor heterogeneity.
The proposed project will be completed under the mentorship of Dr. James Bennett and Dr. Jonathan Perkins,
as part of a structured research training program that includes formal coursework in genetics, statistics, and
bioethics and training in grant writing, manuscript preparation, and research communication."
10826268,"Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSS), the target of therapeutic and illicit drugs, share a common structural
core, e.g., the LeuT fold, with secondary transporters that harness the energy from (electro)chemical ion and/or
substrate gradients to power concentrative substrate symport and/or antiport. This multidisciplinary proposal,
involving iterative functional, spectroscopic and computational methods, seeks to identify commonalities and
divergences in the modes of transport of archetypes of LeuT-fold transporters in the context of differences in the
regulatory role of ions on the driving mechanism and the conformational changes associated with substrate
binding and translocation with special emphasis on how psychoactive drugs modulate the activity of human
serotonin transporter (hSERT). By taking advantage of recent and preliminary findings and state-of-the-art
technologies established in the participating labs, the major goals of the research described in this grant proposal
are the identification of the conformational dynamics associated with the different modes of transport, the binding
sites and permeation pathways of substrates, ions, and drugs within the transporters, and how therapeutic and
illicit psychostimulants modulate the transport process in hSERT. We are particularly interested in testing our
central hypothesis that the mechanistic differences associated with discernable local structural changes and
dynamics are specific to the respective LeuT-fold families, culminating with the remarkable complexity of the
transport mechanism of hSERT, representative for mammalian NSSs, with the overall goal to close the gap in
our understanding of their role in health, disease, and pharmacotherapy. To reach this goal, our line of attack
follows three specific aims, 1) to map the conformational dynamics associated with concentrative substrate
transport by testing our hypothesis that functional specialization entails, in addition to common elements of
alternating access, divergent structural changes between transporter families using double electron-electron
resonance (DEER) spectroscopy to measure distance distributions between pairs of strategically selected
positions in representative LeuT-fold proteins, 2) to delineate the ion-dependent regulation of concentrative
substrate transport by interrogating our hypothesis that concentrative substrate transport is regulated by
transporter-specific discernable ion binding events using binding and flux studies in conjunction with DEER
experiments, and 3) to test the model that amphetamine-induced hSERT reverse transport entails an antiport
mode by testing the hypothesis that amphetamine-elicited serotonin efflux entails in part a switching of the
transport mode that is associated to unique conformational changes in the N-terminal region, whereas the
binding of cocaine, another psychoactive drug, inhibits serotonin transport by blunting the forward transport
mode-associated transitions. Thus, obtaining a holistic understanding of transport mechanism and implementing
a new paradigm for illuminating drug action and providing guidelines for improved therapy design are the long-
term goals of this proposal."
10828445,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
It has become increasingly appreciated that lymphocytes within non-lymphoid tissues exhibit unique effector
programs that extend beyond their roles in anti-pathogen and anti-tumor immunity. Such non-immune functions,
including the regulation of metabolic homeostasis and tissue repair, highlight the diversity of immunological
signals that can be elaborated in a tissue-specific manner to modify physiological and developmental parameters
within a given niche. To achieve these diverse regulatory roles, tissue-localized leukocytes interact with
specialized non-lymphoid cells that define the organ’s function, triggering niche-specific effector programs in
response to perturbations within the tissue microenvironment. In support of this mechanism, a recently described
population of lung regulatory T (Treg) cells were shown to play a pronounced tissue-protective role during the
early stages of acute lung injury caused by influenza virus infection in mice. Through their production of the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand, amphiregulin, these Treg cells support epithelial barrier
regeneration and preserve lung function. Although these findings uncovered an important and previously
unknown role for Treg cell–derived amphiregulin, the mechanistic details of how amphiregulin influences lung
repair remained undetermined. Preliminary studies indicate that in response to lung injury caused by other
damaging stimuli, infiltrating leukocyte populations other than regulatory T cells produce amphiregulin. Further
inspection has suggested that amphiregulin-producing leukocytes may guide alveolar epithelial regeneration by
interacting with specific lung mesenchymal and epithelial stem/progenitor cell populations that orchestrate
discrete steps of the repair process. To this end, the major goals of this proposal are to 1) characterize
interactions between amphiregulin-producing lung leukocytes and resident mesenchymal and epithelial
stem/progenitor cells, 2) identify the molecular basis of these interactions and define their relative significance
for restoring normal lung function, and 3) determine how these cellular interactions are influenced by the severity
or type of damaging stimuli. Successful completion of this project will broaden our understanding of the role of
tissue-specific immune responses in directing tissue regeneration and support the development of future
strategies that seek to stimulate these processes to treat lung disease and restore normal organ homeostasis."
10896404,"Project Summary/Abstract
Radiotherapy is essential to achieve durable disease control for breast cancer patients. However, despite several
decades of research and development in imaging and radiotherapy techniques, breast radiotherapy remains
crude due to the lack of viable methods to accurately isolate, immobilize, localize and target the breast.
Subsequently, the success of tumor control is at the cost of both acute and chronic toxicities that adversely affect
the patients’ quality of life and potentially introduce life-threatening complications decades after the curative
treatment. The challenge in providing accurate breast imaging and therapy is due to the unique biomechanical
properties of the breast, which is an external organ with no internal skeletal support. As a result, its shape varies
substantially with the patient's posture. In the supine position, which is the most stable and common position for
radiotherapy, the breast rests on the chest wall, resulting in its close proximity to the chest wall, lung, heart, and
other vital organs, which creates an undesirable geometry for radiotherapy. Yet, existing devices for supine
breast setup not only provide poor support and immobilization but also adversely interfere with imaging and
therapy X-rays. Patients treated in the prone position experience new problems, including the lower setup
reproducibility, increased cardiac dose due to heart descending, the difficulty to tolerate, and incompatibility with
nodal treatment. To attain the desirable prone breast geometry and avoid drawbacks associated with this posture,
a more effective method to lift the breast from the chest wall and to image the breast in the supine position is
urgently needed for precision image-guided breast radiotherapy. To achieve the first goal, a pneumatically
powered multi-gait soft robot, BreastBot, will be developed and optimized to support and immobilize the breast
in the supine position. The BreastBot will be fabricated in several generic form factors to minimize the cost but
personalized for each breast via an individualized actuation sequence. The feasibility of BreastBot has been
demonstrated using single gait prototypes on volunteers and phantoms. To achieve the second goal, which is to
image the BreastBot immobilized breast for image-guided radiotherapy, avoid imaging dose to the patient's body,
and achieve a higher image quality, a novel supine ceiling-mounted breast CT will be developed. The following
four aims are proposed for image-guided supine breast radiotherapy. Aim 1: Optimization of a breast setup soft
robot (BreastBot) for supine breast setup. Aim 2: Development of a ceiling-mounted CBCT for breast image-
guided radiation therapy. Aim 3: Specific Aim 3: End-to-end integration, validation, and observational patient
study."

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a devastating malignancy associated with high morbidity, poor survival,
and few therapeutic options. OSCC is characterized by heterogeneous cell states, including cancer stem cells
(CSCs), which drive metastasis and therapy resistance. Although there has been some modest success with
targeted therapies, there remains a need for more effective therapeutic options for OSCC. Increasing evidence
has shown that changes in serine metabolism can direct cell fate via epigenomic changes. Endogenous serine
synthesis generates a by-product, alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG), which is a co-substrate for nuclear αKG-
dependent dioxygenases to demethylate histone marker H3K27me3 and de-repress differentiation genes. We
have shown that under serine starvation conditions, metastatic OSCC HSC3 cells slowed proliferation
concomitant with a change in morphology from mesenchymal to epithelial, compared to cells grown in complete
medium. This was associated with a statistically significant increase in the steady-state mRNA and enzyme
levels in the serine synthesis pathway under serine starvation conditions, indicating that HSC3 cells rely on
exogenous serine for growth. The observed switch from exogenous serine uptake to endogenous serine
synthesis in HSC3 cells was accompanied by an increase in αKG concentration. Furthermore, serine starvation
and increased αKG were associated with decrease of repressive histone marker H3K27me3, thus de-repressing
terminal epithelial differentiation genes. Simultaneously, there is a decrease in H3K4me3, a marker of open
chromatin structure, associated with the promotion of stemness genes and aggressive cancer traits in OSCC.
Initial studies into the plasticity of the stem-like identity using the tumorsphere formation assay shows that serine
starvation leads to a lack of tumorspheres stability. Our findings suggest that a switch from exogenous serine
uptake to the endogenous serine biosynthesis promotes OSCC cell differentiation concomitant with the loss of
CSC identity. Given my preliminary studies, I hypothesize that serine deprivation promotes epigenetic changes
that inhibit CSCs and OSCC progression to advanced disease. I will investigate our hypotheses through two
aims. My first aim will be to determine mechanisms underlying epigenetic modifications in a panel of OSCC cell
lines in response to serine deprivation in vitro. This will be investigated through use of migration and invasion
assays, in depth tumorsphere analysis, and epigenomic profiling. My second aim will be to define changes in
tumor size and tumor cell populations in response to dietary serine restriction in vivo, utilizing a syngeneic
4MOSC1 isograft mouse model of OSCC to interrogate the heterogeneity of tumor cell populations through
scRNAseq with biochemical validation. These studies will fill the gap in knowledge how changes in serine
metabolism impact the epigenomic environment and provide insight into novel therapeutic options for OSCC."

Delirium is a syndrome of fluctuating changes in alertness and attention that occurs in up to 40% of older
surgical patients (i.e. age >65. Delirium is associated with an increased risk of developing dementia, a
progressive loss of thinking and memory skills that eventually results in an inability to care for oneself and to
live independently. The most common cause of dementia in older Americans is Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
which is associated with a progressive buildup of abnormal deposits in the brain of two proteins, tau and
amyloid beta. Amyloid beta deposits typically develop in the brain for years if not decades before the start of
memory deficits and other AD symptoms. Patients with these early or “pre-clinical” amyloid beta deposits, even
if they appear mentally normal, are often at increased risk of developing delirium after surgery. Here, we will
examine whether these amyloid beta deposits, or other “pre-clinical” changes in brain structure and activity,
predispose patients to show larger than normal brain activity changes in response to anesthetic drugs given
during surgery. The central idea of this proposal is that an altered (or exaggerated) brain activity responses to
anesthetic drugs is a marker of an unhealthy brain, i.e. a brain with signs of “pre-clinical” AD and which is at
increased risk of postoperative delirium. First we will examine whether patients with evidence of brain amyloid
beta pathology (as measured by spinal fluid amyloid beta levels) have altered brain activity responses to
anesthetic drugs. Second, we will use brain imaging to determine whether changes early AD-like changes in
brain structure and connections are associated with altered brain activity responses to anesthetic drugs. Third,
we will determine whether altered brain activity responses to anesthetic drugs are associated with increased
postoperative delirium occurrence and severity. This work will help us understand mechanisms underlying
postoperative delirium and AD and related dementias, and the links between them. Further, this work will
provide a way for anesthesiologists (and surgeons) to use brain activity recording data already in wide use in
American operating rooms to predict which patients are likely to develop postoperative delirium and/or AD,
which could allow these patients to be selected for interventions to prevent these disorders."
10829915,"The fine-tuning of transcriptional regulation by gene x environment interaction is central to maladaptive
processes associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Research over the past decade has provided
strong support for the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in MDD pathogenesis. microRNAs (miRNAs), a
class of small noncoding RNAs, are generating enormous interest not only as epigenetic mega-regulators of
gene expression, but also for their role in disease pathophysiology and treatment targets. We and other
investigators have shown differential regulation of miRNAs in the brain of MDD individuals. It is generally agreed
that miRNAs mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing in the cytoplasm through seed sequence of miRNAs
and complementary sequences in the 3′-untranslated regions (UTR) of target mRNAs via Argonaute (Ago)-
based-RNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). Recently, a paradigm-shifting phenomenon has been put forth
with the concept of “nuclear localization” of select mature miRNAs. These miRNAs, containing unique set(s) of
nuclear signals in the 3’ terminus, can shuttle back to nucleus from cytoplasm where they can regulate the
expression of select nuclear pool of coding and non-coding RNA transcripts post-transcriptionally, but more
remarkably, transcriptionally. At the transcription level, there is evidence of putative binding sites of mature
miRNAs in the gene promoter regions with partial or perfect sequence complementarity, which enables nuclear
miRNAs to regulate gene transcription, including primary(pri-)-miRNAs. Post-transcriptionally, nuclear miRNAs
in conjunction with endonuclease Drosha, can target pri-miRNAs or can bind to 3’UTR region of nuclear coding
transcripts via miRISC. The newly discovered mechanism poses an interesting possibility that within the nucleus,
miRNAs may have the distinct capability of repatterning the gene transcription dynamics dramatically where they
can not only regulate their own expression at pri- and precursor(pre)-miRNA levels, but also at the nuclear coding
transcript level. This could be highly relevant in MDD-associated maladaptation processes. We propose an
overarching hypothesis that a dynamic shift and nuclear enrichment of mature miRNAs driven by specific nuclear
signals and their regulation of key pri-, pre-, and mature miRNAs, and coding genes within the nucleus, and
consequent functional attributes, will be central to MDD pathogenesis. Using highly innovative approaches and
well characterized and matched brain samples from MDD and non-psychiatric control subjects, we aim to
determine: 1) the nuclear enrichment of miRNAs, cytosolic to nuclear shift, and their functional relevance; 2)
possible mechanism(s) of miRNA translocation; 3) the unique transcriptional regulatory role of nuclear miRNAs
in changing the promoter dynamics of target genes as a function of Ago1 complex; and 4) the unique role of
nuclear miRNAs in modifying the processing of pri-miRNAs as a function of Drosha microprocessor complex.
Our study is highly innovative and has the potential to uncover the unique role of nuclear miRNAs in redefining
transcriptome as a mechanism in MDD etiology and identifying novel targets for therapeutic intervention."

Pediatric Crohn's Disease (CD) is a chronic, progressive disease which can have a severe impact on a child's
growth, and development. Children are more likely to develop advanced forms of the disease within years of
diagnosis. Treating pediatric Crohn's cases requires careful consideration as powerful anti-inflammatory
treatments may have adverse effects and may not be necessary depending on severity of disease. Therefore,
risk stratifying pediatric Crohn's populations, and predicting future subtypes, including structural manifestations
of disease and a lack of response to treatments, is an urgent unmet need. While genomic markers of disease
have been studied at length, exploration of the metabolic signature of pediatric Crohn's is less developed. Studies
in recent years have identified metabolic changes which occur during Crohn's, including changes in lipid, amino
acid, tricarboxylic acid and sulfur metabolism. But metabolic shifts have not been studied in enough detail or in
large enough cohorts to become clinical biomarkers, especially for delineating subtypes of disease rather than
Crohn's versus normal tissue. And although metabolic pathways are targetable and there are preliminary findings
that blocking metabolic pathways (i.e., the mevalonate pathway), can be beneficial for Crohn's outcome,
targeting metabolism has not become a widespread phenomenon. In this proposal, we will leverage
computational methods to analyze transcriptomics data from large pediatric CD cohorts and map this data onto
mathematical metabolic reconstructions to assess metabolic shifts. We hypothesize that identification of
unique metabolic shifts in population-based cohorts will inform prediction of Crohn's subtypes, both
structural and treatment-based. In Aim 1, we propose to build a novel computational metabolic network
reconstruction that will be specific to the metabolic functioning of the ileum, a primary site of Crohn's pathology.
This model will serve as a reference for understanding CD metabolic shifts but can also serve as a resource for
other groups studying metabolism shifts in the small bowel. In Aim 2, we will leverage existing data from the
large pediatric CD cohort, to computationally overlay transcriptomics from a range of subtypes onto our metabolic
network reconstruction to assess shifts in metabolism. We will also recruit a prospective cohort of CD patients
from both the University of Virginia and Emory University, collect tissue, perform RNA sequencing, and repeat
our computational metabolic modeling to validate our analysis of archived data. These results will be further
validated by mass spectrometry metabolomics and lipidomics. Finally, in Aim 3, we will profile the transcriptomic
and metabolomic signatures of pediatric Crohn's-patient derived ileal organoids, to test if organoids are a
valuable proxy for studying metabolic shifts in vivo for mechanistic intervention experiments. Together, these
experiments will pave the way towards using high-throughput metabolic data to risk stratify pediatric Crohn's
patient subtypes, which can facilitate personalized medicine treatment paradigms."

 Cannabis is one of the most illicit drugs used during pregnancy, and with increased legalization, use
during pregnancy is expected to rise. Clinical studies have shown prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE) results
in residual cognitive deficits in offspring. Despite the rise in PCE, there is little understanding of a
comprehensive mechanistic pathway responsible for learning and memory deficits associated with PCE. Our
long-range goal is to understand how PCE affects cognition, and the goal of this proposal is to dissect the
molecular mechanisms of memory and synaptic plasticity deficits associated with PCE. Our preliminary data
demonstrate hippocampal-dependent memory impairments in PCE animals are concomitant with synaptic
deficits in the form of decreased long-term potentiation (LTP) and enhanced long-term depression (LTD).
Furthermore, we have demonstrated reductions in polysialylated-NCAM (PSA-NCAM), which is required for
neurogenesis, neuronal pathfinding, and learning and memory. We have previously established that decreased
PSA-NCAM can lead to deficits in LTP by modulating GluN2B-Ras-GRF1-p38 MAPK signaling pathway and
altering the signaling balance of GluN2A- and GluN2B- containing NMDA receptors. Our preliminary data with
PCE also indicates a decrease in GluN2A receptor expression and signaling with no change in GluN2B
expression, indicating an imbalance in signaling. Based on our preliminary and published data, we hypothesize
that PSA-NCAM mediated alterations in GluN2A- and GluN2B- signaling pathways are responsible for the
altered synaptic plasticity and memory deficits resulting from PCE. The objective of this proposal is to dissect
the molecular mechanisms by which PCE induces synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits. We will use a
multidisciplinary approach including behavioral, electrochemical, electrophysiological, cellular and molecular
methodologies to test our hypotheses. We propose three interrelated but sequentially independent specific
aims: (1) Investigate the molecular mechanisms of behavioral and synaptic plasticity deficits resulting from
PCE, (2) Investigate how PSA-NCAM modifies synaptic transmission and plasticity by regulating NMDA
receptor-mediated signaling in PCE animals, and (3) Determine the functional outcomes of application of a PSA
mimetic & modulation of GluN2A- and GluN2B- containing NMDA receptors on PCE-induced synaptic plasticity
and memory deficits. The data from our study not only points toward a specific mechanism responsible for
PCE-related deficits but will also comprehensively assess the different roles played by synaptic molecules
responsible for plasticity mechanisms closely associated with cognition."

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative condition. Aging and the 4 allele of the
APOE gene are the strongest genetic risk factor for AD. APOE is the main cholesterol transporter in the brain
that promotes neuronal growth, debris clearance, and it is mainly produced by astrocytes. Upon inflammatory
insults APOE is produced by microglia to act as an immunomodulator. Chronic inflammation exacerbates the
progression of AD pathology. Previous studies show an effect of APOE4 genotype in decreased levels of APOE
protein in the brain, increased inflammation at baseline, and simplification of dendritic spines. The studies
proposed here aim to understand APOE4-related alteration in microglial function prior AD onset. We generated
a novel human APOE knock-in mice expressing GFP under the CX3CR1 promoter to study the effects of APOE
genotype in homeostatic microglia function. So far in my thesis, I have examined the disturbances of APOE4 in
homeostatic microglial function and found that APOE4 altered microglia surveillance and response to
damage through the downregulation of chemotactic purinergic receptors. I have also studied the effects
of aging, sex, and APOE genotype in microglial function and found that aging affects microglia response to
damage, and these alterations occur earlier in APOE4 brains.
 This F99/K00 proposal will encompass 2 aims presented in the following research plan. In Aim 1, I will
identify the molecular mechanism underlying microglial alteration in homeostatic function and response to
amyloid  (A). Aim 1a will examine whole transcriptome RNA-seq from APOE3 and APOE4 microglia. We will
identify genes differentially expressed in APOE3 and APOE4 microglia and investigate specific pathways
involved in altering homeostatic microglial function. Aim 1b will examine the effects of APOE genotype on
microglia's ability to recognize A prior AD onset. We will investigate microglia response to acute exposure to
A and if APOE genotype affects microglia affinity to A monomers and oligomers. Aim 1c will study APOE
protein interaction with A and its effect on phagocytosis. We will investigate APOE-A interactions and their
effect on microglia recognition of A and uptake. In Aim 2, I will continue to build skills in a post-doctoral setting
researching the mechanisms underlying microglia crosstalk with the peripheral immune system during aging and
neuronal degeneration. To achieve this, I will first identify the ideal postdoctoral lab and then obtain the
postdoctoral position. I aim to complete my postdoctoral fellowship in an institution that values innovation,
scientific rigor, training, and professional development. To obtain this fellowship, my sponsor and I are
working closely in identifying conferences and inviting speakers that will allow me to expand my network
and identify the ideal lab setting. The F99/K00 will greatly assist me in both completing my PhD and obtaining
the postdoctoral fellowship I am striving for."
10838787,"Summary
Virus entry begins with the first encounter between the virus and the cell surface and ends with delivery of the
contents of the virus into the host cell. HIV-1 membrane fusion is the first key delivery step, mediated by the
virus-encoded envelope glycoprotein [Env; trimeric (gp160)3 cleaved to (gp120/gp41)3], which belongs to the
group of class I viral fusion proteins including influenza hemagglutinin, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Ebola
glycoprotein. A mature Env spike has three copies each of noncovalently-associated receptor-binding subunit
gp120 and fusion subunit gp41. Sequential binding of gp120 to the primary receptor CD4 and a coreceptor
(chemokine receptor CCR5 or CXCR4) leads to large, irreversible structural rearrangements in gp41, which drive
fusion. This picture, derived largely from structural studies of the soluble fragments and from cellular studies with
inhibitors and antibodies, is still incomplete because it lacks extension to a high-resolution picture of the complete
Env trimer in the context of a lipid-bilayer membrane, which is the substrate of the fusion reaction. We have
determined by NMR the structures of the HIV-1 Env transmembrane domain (TMD), membrane proximal external
region (MPER), and cytoplasmic tail (CT) in bicelles that mimic lipid bilayers. These regions all form well-ordered,
trimeric clusters in a lipid bilayer. Disruption of any of them can reduce membrane fusion efficiency and alter the
antigenic structure of the entire Env, suggesting that they have structural and functional roles in fusion and in
trimer conformational stabilization. Very recently, we have completed a high-resolution structure of the intact
SARS-CoV-2 postfusion spike in membrane, showing how the functionally critical membrane-interacting regions
interact with membrane and with each other. These findings are the basis of our overall hypothesis that that
structures of the HIV-1 fusion complex either alone or bound with fusion inhibitors in membrane will reveal new
structural features of the membrane-interacting regions and substantially advance our mechanistic
understanding of the viral fusion and its inhibition, thereby informing future development of intervention
strategies. We will apply advanced technologies in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and tomography
(cryo-ET) to study structural and functional properties of the HIV-1 fusion complex, as reconstituted in
membranes and on the surface of a virus particle. We will also investigate molecular mechanisms of HIV-1
inhibition by two distinct types of fusion inhibitors. Our goal is a ""molecular movie"" of HIV-1 fusion, to inform
development of new intervention strategies. We propose the following Specific Aims to address our hypothesis:
1) We will determine structure of the HIV-1 fusion complex containing intact Env, CD4 and CCR5 in the context
of a lipid bilayer. 2) We will investigate molecular mechanism of HIV-1 fusion inhibition by anti-CD4 antibody
ibalizumab. 3) We will dissect mechanism of action of small-molecule fusion inhibitors targeting the MPER of
HIV-1 Env."
10932985,"The burden of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has increased
substantially over the past two decades. Although both NAFLD and HCC disproportionately affect Latino
individuals, few Latinos were included in genetic and epidemiologic studies evaluating HCC risk. Prior genetic
studies examining NAFLD risk that did include Latinos were limited in that they used candidate-gene approaches
which cannot detect novel genetic associations. Other studies limited inclusion to individuals from one country,
and thus could not consider how the incredible diversity among Latinos might drive genetic risk or differences in
NAFLD phenotype, risk of cirrhosis, or HCC risk. In the proposed study, Drs. Jones and Flores will work
collaboratively as multiple principal investigators. Along with co-investigators, they will collaborate with other
members of the Liver Cirrhosis Network (LCN) to develop precise, personalized approaches to NAFLD
prognostication and HCC risk stratification targeted specifically to Latinos, a vulnerable population with excess
disease burden. In Aim 1, Drs. Flores and Jones will leverage existing data from two studies (UCLA ATLAS
Community Health Initiative and NIH All of Us Research Program) to conduct a genome wide association study
(GWAS), phenome-wide association study, and create polygenic risk scores in persons with NAFLD. All of Us
and ATLAS aim to enroll diverse participants to ensure inclusivity and generalizability in Precision Medicine
research. As such, the proposed study represents the largest, most racially diverse GWAS in NAFLD with 21,199
individuals with NAFLD already identified. We will define the relationship between known and novel single
nucleotide polypmorphisms (SNPs) and risk of NAFLD, NASH, NAFLD-cirrhosis, and NAFLD-HCC, stratified by
race, region of origin and genetic ancestry. In collaboration with LCN investigators, Drs. Flores and Jones will
enroll Latino participants with NAFLD into a prospective case-control study that aims to characterize gene-
environment interactions between known and novel genetic NAFLD-associated SNPs and environmental risk
factors including HIV, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. They will engage new and existing LCN Cohort
participants as well as participants enrolled in existing cohorts at the University of Miami (UM), the University of
Los Angeles California (UCLA) and the University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC). All
sites will identify and recruit new cases with NAFLD and healthy controls. We will develop polygenic risk scores
that incorporate genetic, clinical, sociocultural, behavioral, and environmental characteristics to predict (1) risk
of cirrhosis in persons with NAFLD, (2) hepatic decompensation in NAFLD patients with cirrhosis, and (3) HCC
risk in NAFLD patients with or without cirrhosis. NAFLD is the fastest growing cause of cirrhosis in the US and
disproportionately impacts Latinos who also have the highest HCC burden. By identifying the strongest risk
factors that drive differences in NAFLD phenotype, cirrhosis decompensation, and HCC risk in a large, diverse
Latino sample, we can identify those at greatest risk and intervene on modifiable risk factors."
10855870,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Although behavioral interventions for obesity achieve clinically meaningful weight loss, post-treatment weight
regain remains a pernicious challenge. Extended care interventions that include evidence-based behavioral
strategies can improve weight loss maintenance (WLM), but many of these strategies require significant effort
and resources that can hinder treatment adherence. Thus, strategies are needed that increase individuals'
capacity (i.e., resources, abilities, and readiness) to consistently engage in WLM behaviors while minimizing the
effort required of treatment. However, the most effective strategies for this are unknown. By leveraging the
multiphase optimization strategy framework and a factorial experimental design, this application proposes an
extended care optimization trial to efficiently test four “minimally disruptive” intervention components (i.e.,
effective treatments designed to enhance capacity with limited participant burden). Following an initial 6-month
weight loss phase, participants achieving 5% weight loss (N=272) will be randomized into a 12-month trial to
receive 0-4 of the intervention components in addition to a core, extended care program. The minimally disruptive
components include: 1) reduced food variety (i.e., limiting number of energy-dense dinners and snacks), 2)
home-based resistance training (i.e., low-dose prescriptions performed x2/week), 3) buddy training and support
(i.e., leveraging individuals from existing social networks to provide support), and 4) acceptance and commitment
therapy (ACT) workshops (i.e., condensed ACT skills training). These components have empirical support for
weight management but are distinct from conventional behavioral WLM recommendations. Further, all are
designed to enhance individuals' capacity with limited burden. The primary outcome is WLM between
randomization and month 12. An optimized intervention package will be assembled based on the combination
of minimally disruptive components most effective for WLM. In addition, hypothesized mediators of each
treatment component and participant characteristics moderating treatment response will be examined. This
project will lead to an optimized WLM intervention package that can be evaluated in a subsequent confirmatory
randomized controlled trial. This line of research can inform best practices for the provision of WLM interventions,
improve long-term outcomes for individuals, and strengthen the overall public health impact of available weight
management interventions for disease prevention and management."

Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) comprise a heterogeneous group of chronic autoimmune diseases that
can lead to severe muscle weakness and chronic disability; however, it is their association with
contemporaneous cancer (cancer-associated myositis, CAM), that is responsible for mortality rates approaching
50%. Myositis-specific autoantibodies have emerged as important biomarkers, and are associated with an
increased risk of cancer, but are of limited utility in predicting if cancer will emerge in an individual patient – the
majority of patients with the highest-risk antibodies for CAM never have cancer diagnosed. Despite multiple
studies focused on the myositis-cancer association, the ability to predict cancer, and the biologic
relationship between cancer and myositis, remain poorly understood.
Given the inability to predict cancer, the current standard is that the majority of patients with IIM are
aggressively screened for cancer for multiple years following diagnosis, leading to increased cost, radiation, and
false positive results. Beyond CAM prediction, the biologic relationship between IIM and cancer has been
historically neglected; specifically, how cancer emergence and elimination impact IIM outcomes is largely
unknown. However, insights gained from the careful study of cancer emergence/elimination in IIM can inform
research into disease mechanism, particularly given that cancer has been hypothesized to be responsible for
IIM development – so called “cancer-induced autoimmunity”. In this setting, the recent development of highly
sensitive, novel cancer detection technologies have enabled the robust study of cancer in IIM cohorts. The
overall goals of this proposal are to (i) optimize the prediction of CAM at the individual patient level and
(ii) determine how the emergence and elimination of cancer influence IIM clinical outcomes.
In Aim 1, we will utilize three of the largest cohorts of IIM patients in the United States to develop and
validate a cancer prediction model to inform clinical decision-making. In Aim 2, the relationship between cancer
emergence, cancer elimination, and IIM outcomes will be determined using novel liquid biopsy cancer detection
technologies, providing insights into IIM pathogenesis and improvements in disease monitoring. Understanding
the cancer-IIM relationship will ultimately enable development of novel, effective treatment strategies
that are focused on cancer detection/elimination rather than the currently used non-specific
immunosuppression approaches."
10855771,"In this project we aim to transform glycemic control during physical activity (PA) among persons with Type
1 diabetes (PwD) by testing three novel complementary approaches toward adjusting insulin delivery
before, during, and after PA. The vision behind these approaches is based on the importance of PA for
myriad health considerations among PwD—and the reluctance among some to exercise because of fear
of hypoglycemia or the need to plan and manage insulin requirements around PA. The approaches we will
test each employ separate ways to adjust insulin delivery related to PA: 1) accounting for real-time
changes in insulin sensitivity following PA, 2) the amount of “activity-on-board,” which acknowledges the
ongoing influence of prior activity on future insulin needs, and 3) anticipated future activity based on past
PA patterns. These studies are particularly valuable given the long track-record of the UVa Center for
Diabetes Technology (CDT) in both T1D-related engineering innovations and in the CDT’s ability to test
novel developments using well-designed clinical trials.
It is important to note that all of the studies in this proposal are assessed in the context of the UVA fully-
closed loop (FCL) automated insulin delivery system (AID), called APEX, meaning that these new
approaches are meant to be incorporated into an AID system in which PwD will not need to announce
carbohydrate intake or PA—allowing for a more spontaneous life. Each of the approaches to improving
glycemia in the setting of PA is implemented as an algorithmic module added to the APEX FCL controller—
and the safety and efficacy of each of the modules is compared to APEX without the given algorithmic
module in a randomized, double-blinded, cross-over fashion, allowing direct comparison of the added
benefit of each individual module.
In Aim 1 of this proposal, we hypothesize that continuously tracking insulin sensitivity and “activity-on-
board” (tested separately) and informing the APEX system of these construct to modulate insulin delivery
during and after PA will improve glycemia via reduction of the Low Blood Glucose Index (LBGI) compared
to APEX alone. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that an automated system can detect daily patterns of PA
and that these patterns can be anticipated by the APEX controller, for example by reducing insulin prior
to a likely PA, and improve glycemia (again with LBGI as primary outcome). The trials in both Aims 1&2
will be in a hotel setting with supervised exercise sessions. Aim 3 then focuses on the deployment of the
PA-informed APEX system at home during a randomized, cross-over study with 3-week sessions and usual
home PA design to confirm the superiority of the exercise-informed AID.
These studies will advance T1D management by rigorously testing novel means of glucose management
in the setting of PA—with the overall goal of making exercise safer and more feasible for PwD."

The new Center for Preventions Research (CPR) was developed to facilitate and promote research for
identifying health risks and modifying and testing state-of-the-art intervention strategies applicable to children
residing in rural communities. In particular, the CPR is designed to support researchers in advancing across
the prevention research continuum from state-of-the-art epidemiological and modeling projects to R01-funded
intervention research that is informed and developed through CPR support. Achieving this goal requires more
than just identifying talented early career researchers working in this field. For these researchers and others to
be successful outside the context of an academic medical center we have identified and developed the key
resources necessary for advancing rural prevention research. The goal of the Administrative Core is to provide
the leadership and vision necessary to facilitate the accomplishment of the specific aims outlined in the Overall
Center Organization and Management Plan, thereby ensuring long-term sustainability of the Center. The
Administrative Core will provide management and oversight of the many activities that will allow the Center to
achieve its aims of developing a critical mass of junior investigators engaged in innovative research. The Core
will do this by establishing a supportive infrastructure oriented around professional development, overseeing
the CPR research support cores, implementing strategies to recruit new investigators to the Center, and
facilitating an evaluation strategy to ensure rational growth and continuous improvement. The Administrative
Core infrastructure will include support from an External Advisory Committee, an Internal Advisory Committee
and an Administrative Advisor. To support professional development of junior faculty the Administrative Core
will invest substantial resources into mentorship, grant writing and development of scholarly leadership. To
grow a sustainable Center and foster a critical mass of investigators focused on rural children's health, the
Administrative Core will engage in marketing and outreach activities and will allocate resources towards new
hires and pilot projects. Finally, the Administrative Core will have a formal evaluation plan that will include
formative and summative assessments of faculty development and overall CPR progress in building a
sustainable Center that develops junior faculty and, ultimately, facilitates positive, sustained impact on rural
children's health."
10862772,"Project Summary/Abstract
Montana is the most rural state in the West region, and improving overall health and reducing risks among
rural children requires a comprehensive understanding of how prevention strategies can be developed for,
adapted to, and tested in rural communities. Among the barriers faced by investigators addressing important
rural health issues is the difficulty in accessing electronic medical records and other sensitive data sources
outside an academic medical center. For the first time in Montana, the DM Core will provide a central resource
for capture and management of electronic health records, vital statistics and other sensitive records across
multiple providers and data sources. Another challenge faced by rural health investigators is that rural
communities present unique challenges from a data analytics perspective. In particular, rural communities are
more insular, more sparsely populated, have more limited environmental monitoring, and often have less
access to health-related resources. Such factors will require innovative biostatistical and modeling approaches
that are supported by high performance computing (HPC) capabilities. The DM Core will provide the
biostastistical and modeling expertise as well as the HPC resources to address these challenges. Overall, the
DM Core will provide the necessary data science, biostatistical, mathematical, and computational resources to
successfully support and conduct prevention research for rural communities.  "

The proposed Center for Smart use of Technologies to Assess Real-world Outcomes (C-STAR) will serve as a 
national resource to help investigators employ technologies to measure and interpret data relevant to 
sensorimotor and cognitive function in the lab, clinic, and real world. This will be accomplished by leveraging our 
broad expertise in the clinical, social, and technical sciences. The Shirley Ryan AbilityLab (SRAlab) is the focal 
point of this expertise as it is where many of our clinicians and scientists, together with our many patients, are 
collocated; however, C-STAR participants will also benefit from expertise that extends far beyond the SRAlab. 
We will leverage our many external collaborations to facilitate our Center's mission and maximize our impact. 
The majority of our external collaborations are with Northwestern University, which has a long record of research 
and leadership in the movement, rehabilitation, and cognitive sciences. SRAlab clinicians and scientists regularly 
partner with faculty from Northwestern University Schools of Engineering, Medicine, and Communication, and 
many of our personnel hold appointments at both institutions. In addition, the translational nature of our research 
has led to partnerships with companies that are developing instruments for assessing and augmenting 
sensorimotor and cognitive function. Our collaboration plan draws on these existing connections to expand the 
opportunities and expertise that C-STAR can provide to the rehabilitation research community. The goals of 
these collaborations are to: (1) coalesce local expertise to meet challenges in design, implementation, and 
interpretation of measures of sensorimotor and cognitive deficits. This will be accomplished by combining 
expertise from colleagues in both insitutions (SRAlab and NU) and (2) develop a network of companies that can 
help C-STAR participants translate ideas to practice. Expertise within C-STAR will be organized into four Cores: 
Engineering, Clinical, Outcomes, and Implementation Science and Community Engagement. These cores 
represent not only our expertise but also the domains of knowledge we believe are critical for deploying the smart 
(i.e., appropriate, accurate, and clinically meaningful) use of technology for assessments in the real world. We 
will leverage existing collaborations with colleagues at Northwestern University with wide-ranging, deep 
experience across all Cores, providing expertise and mentorship to C-STAR participants who apply for pilot 
funding or participate in collaborative research or sabbaticals, and contributing to C-STAR didactic resources on 
use of technology in rehabilitation. Our industry contacts provide us with established conduits for translational 
science, and we will leverage these connections to provide advice and opportunities to C-STAR participants for 
commercialization of technologies developed, tested, or validated by our participants. In summary, we believe 
that the C-STAR collaborations will be a major asset to our program and its participants. Our connections to 
Northwestern University and to industry expand our pool of expertise and broaden the network of scientists and 
engineers working on challenges related to the smart use of technology in rehabilitation."
10862830,"ABSTRACT – ANIMAL RESOURCES SHARED RESOURCE
The Animal Resources Shared Resource is a Cancer Center-managed Shared Resource that provides a
comprehensive animal care and use program for Center investigators. The facility has been AAALAC-accredited
since 1988. The Core provides five basic types of services: (1) husbandry and equipment sanitation/sterilization,
(2) mouse breeding procedures and maintenance; (3) procedural techniques training and support; (4) in vivo
imaging, blood analysis, and irradiation; and (5) veterinary services and administrative/IACUC support. The
animal facility currently occupies 25,602 sq. ft of space in four buildings. Mice are the primary species used, with
occasional housing of rats. Over the last 5-year grant period, AR averaged 8,389 occupied mouse cages per
month, with growth in the last 2 years to more than 9,000 cages/month. The mice are housed in individually
ventilated caging systems. There is sufficient capacity for growth, as the facility is capable of maintaining up to
13,000 cages but generally operates at ~70% capacity, which facilitates breeding colony maintenance and
protocol housing requirements. AR provides full-service animal care that includes all husbandry as well as setting
up breedings, weaning litters, obtaining tail samples, maintaining animal pedigrees, census and IDs. This
comprehensive service is also cost-effective, with the per diem including those services at $0.72/cage for
standard mice. The AR staff perform an additional range of services for Center investigators, including
intravenous (tail and retro-orbital veins), subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, and
mammary fat pad injections, oral gavage, tumor measurements, blood and tissue collection, body weights,
perfusions, and pre- and post-operative surgical care. The Core provides essential scientific support to Center
members by supplying animal models and expert technical assistance for investigation of tumor development
and growth in vivo. The Tumor Analysis facility is a key resource in this respect, providing access to a variety of
xenograft models, including patient-derived xenografts, and further assisting with the experimental design and
carrying out studies of genetic factors or experimental compounds that influence tumor growth and metastasis.
This service is supported by an array of sophisticated imaging modalities for evaluating tumor progression,
including luminescence, fluorescence, and ultrasound. Additional Animal Analysis services include blood cell,
serum, behavioral, and metabolic analysis. In the past five years, 44 Investigators from all three Cancer Center
programs have made extensive use of the Animal Resources, and the Core has provided support for the
publication of 116 cancer-relevant papers by Cancer Center investigators."

This application is to request support for the 2024 Gordon Research Seminar (GRS; March 16-17) and
Conference (GRC; March 17-22) on Myelin to be held in Ventura, California, USA. The goal of these
conferences is to provide an active forum for the exchange of results at the cutting edge of myelin
development, physiology, pathology, and treatment. This meeting uniquely focuses on central and peripheral
myelin and is timely given the growing interest in myelin biology and human disease and major advances since
the last meeting in 2022. We have chosen as a theme for this conference “Dynamism and Life-Long Plasticity
of Myelin Producing Cells in Health and Disease” to reflect the major shift over the past few years from
considering myelin as a relatively static structure to the new view of myelin as a dynamic structure throughout
the lifetime of the organism. This dynamism and the plasticity of Schwann Cells and oligodendrocytes impacts
normal myelin-axonal function as well as in diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer’s Disease,
peripheral neuropathies, and after injury, including in developmental disorders, and in the adult. We have also
organized sessions to reflect dynamic glial-to-glia interactions and glial–neuronal interactions that influence
normal myelin development, disease progression, and repair in the CNS and PNS. Together, the 2022 Myelin
GRC “Myelin: Dynamism and Life-Long Plasticity of Myelin Producing Cells in Health and Disease and the
GRS “Navigating Myelin Plasticity: A Roadmap through Health and Disease” will: 1) assemble an international
meeting of academic scientists, clinician/scientists, and industry scientists engaged in studies of myelination
and myelin repair; 2) discuss new and exciting developments in the field by selecting presenters who will
largely present unpublished data and by reserving presentation slots for talks selected from the abstracts; 3)
promote collaborative interactions to accelerate the pace of discovery to treat diseases of myelin; 4) provide an
opportunity for junior attendees of diverse backgrounds to present their work, interact with other scientists, and
promote collaborative interactions among all participants."

Young adulthood is a developmental epoch for alcohol misuse (defined as a pattern of drinking that increases
risks for adverse health outcomes). Multiracial (defined as having biological parents of two or more
racial/ethnic groups) young adults may be differentially vulnerable to alcohol misuse as they report both the
highest prevalence of past-year alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorder compared to other racial/ethnic
young adults. Multiracial discrimination is a racially relevant stressor for Multiracial young adults and may be
associated with alcohol-related disparities, as consistent with minority stress and tension reduction
frameworks, as well as robust support for the discrimination-alcohol misuse association in monoracial young
adults. However, our knowledge of Multiracial discrimination is fragmented and compounded by measurement
concerns. Notably, general discrimination scales are commonly used to assess Multiracial discrimination
despite research demonstrating general discrimination and Multiracial discrimination as distinct constructs.
Further, existing Multiracial discrimination scales lack specificity with the source of the discriminatory treatment
even though discriminatory messages vary by perpetrators and may be differentially associated with health
(including alcohol) outcomes. In the absence of a scale capturing the lived experience of Multiracial
discrimination among Multiracial people, alcohol researchers cannot resolve whether Multiracial discrimination
is a sociocultural determinant of alcohol misuse and contributing to alcohol-related disparities among
Multiracial young adults, who are driving substantial demographic change in the United States. Thus, using a
sequential mixed methods approach, the proposed project aims to (a) explore and generate a nuanced view of
Multiracial discrimination using thematic analysis from Multiracial young adult focus groups, (b) develop and (c)
psychometrically validate the Multiracial Discrimination Scale using exploratory and confirmatory factor
analyses, and (d) assess concurrent associations between Multiracial discrimination with alcohol misuse using
structural equational modeling. Findings of this project will provide alcohol researchers with a psychometrically
sound scale to characterize the scope and magnitude of the Multiracial discrimination-alcohol misuse pathway,
to potentially highlight an intervention point preceding alcohol misuse, and thus informing the culturally
sensitive design of evidence-based interventions implemented to reduce and prevent alcohol misuse among
Multiracial young adults. This NRSA Individual Predoctoral Fellowship to Promote Diversity in Health-Related
Research would provide specialized training in mixed methodologies (e.g., connecting qualitative/quantitative
data), psychometric statistics (e.g., test theory), and investigating latent constructs (e.g., structural equation
modeling), thus providing instrumental support for my developing research program, and laying out a path for a
long, prolific, NIH-funded alcohol research career."
10824565,"Abstract
 Neuronal function depends on the precise localization and release of neuromodulators, such as growth
factors, in response to stimuli. Our lab recently identified an unexpected, but exciting role for ER stress sensor
PERK, PKR-like ER kinase, in neuronal growth factor localization. Specifically, in the absence of PERK, a
dendritic TGF-ß-like growth factor is mistargeted to the axons, while an axonal insulin-like-growth factor (IGF) is
retained in the cell body. Interestingly, PERK is genetically linked to the tauopathies Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). At least two of the three genetic variants have decreased kinase
activity, but it is unknown how decreased activity is a risk for disease. Impairment of PERK’s role in the correct
localization of neuroprotective IGF and TGF-ß-like growth factors could provide a molecular connection to
neurodegeneration.
 Because it is unclear how PERK may directly mediate growth factor localization, I asked whether PERK
functions through one of its known downstream targets. Strikingly, I found that CaMKII, a kinase whose function
is critical for neural plasticity and memory, is genetically downstream of PERK. Importantly, CaMKII has a known
function in axonal targeting of neuropeptides, which has the potential to explain PERK’s novel role in growth
factor localization. This proposal aims to define how PERK and CaMKII interact to control axonal-dendritic
targeting of select neuroprotective growth factors. To do this, I will test whether PERK acts through its kinase
activity, whether phosphorylation-dependent activation state of CaMKII affects growth factor localization, and
whether PERK directly phosphorylates CaMKII. The proposed studies will be completed primarily at Drexel
University under the guidance of the sponsor and co-sponsor; however, I will seek guidance from my
collaborators at UPenn, especially for the advanced in vitro kinase assays to test whether PERK directly
phosphorylates CaMKII proposed in Aim 2. Together with my sponsors, I have developed a comprehensive
training plan that addresses training in hypothesis-driven research, scientific communication and writing, and
career development, as well as augmenting my formal training in neuroscience. The overarching goal of this pre-
doctoral fellowship project is to guide me in preparing for an independent career in biomedical research, focusing
on the areas related to protein-based pathology in neurodegeneration."
10825261,"Project Summary
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths with a 5-year survival
rate of 12%. Over 90% of PDAC is driven by oncogenic KRAS, however inhibitors targeting KRAS have been
unsuccessful in the clinic thus far. Targeting oncogenic vulnerabilities is a key alternative approach. Oncogenic
RAS-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) drives tumor progression through hyperactivation of proliferative,
anti-apoptotic, and metastatic pathways. However, ROS can also trigger tumor suppressive outcomes through
cellular damage. The nucleotide pool-cleansing 8-oxo-dGTPase MutT Homolog 1 (MTH1) is a critical redox
protective adaptation in RAS-driven tumor cells to overcome tumor-inhibitory ROS mediated consequences.
MTH1 has been shown to prevent oncogene-induced oxidative stress and damage, and maintain high KRAS
oncoprotein expression, associated ROS-driven oncogenic signaling, and tumorigenicity in lung cancer. Given
the importance of MTH1 in KRAS oncogenic biology and the fact that over 90% of PDAC is driven by oncogenic
KRAS, I propose that MTH1 is similarly important in PDAC. In support of this idea, TCGA analysis revealed
MTH1 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissue compared to normal tissue, and high MTH1 significantly
correlates with poor disease-free survival. The Rai lab reported 8-oxodGTPase activity is significantly elevated
in patient PDAC tumor vs. normal tissue. Preliminary data show MTH1 loss reduces tumor burden in a subset of
PKT cohorts, with lower burden associated with both reduced intratumoral EGFR expression and in cytokines
associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). When MTH1 is depleted via shRNA in
PDAC cell lines, there is a significant decrease in proliferation associated with decreased total EGFR. Analysis
of human PDAC tumor data through TIMER 2.0 shows intratumoral MTH1 expression significantly correlates
with infiltration of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), suggesting high MTH1 expression supports and/or
creates the immunosuppressive TME that make PDAC so difficult to treat. Therefor I hypothesize MTH1 is
important for PDAC tumorigenesis through both tumor cell-intrinsic as well as previously-unappreciated
extrinsic mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, I will use our novel PKT mouse models with systemic and
pancreas-specific MTH1 loss. Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will assess how systemic vs pancreas-specific
MTH1 loss affects in vivo KRAS tumorigenesis; Aim 2 will independently ascertain how MTH1 regulates KRAS-
driven transformation and PDAC chemoresistance. Upon completion of these studies, we will establish novel
mechanisms by which MTH1 regulates tumorigenesis thus filling a gap in the field regarding the link between
MTH1 and KRAS in PDAC. Lastly, these aims have the potential to validate MTH1 as an alternative to targeting
oncogenic KRAS in PDAC patients which has been unsuccessful to date."

Mechanical forces generated by a rigid extracellular matrix (ECM) in the tumor microenvironment play a key
role in tumor progression and metastasis. We recently discovered a critical role of EPHA2 non-canonical
signaling in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor invasion and metastasis in response
to increasing ECM stiffness in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, we found that activation of EPHA2
canonical signaling by the ephrinA1 ligand potently inhibits stiffness-induced breast cancer cell invasiveness.
Based on these results, we hypothesize that EPHA2 functions as a key rheostat that integrates both
mechanical and biochemical cues from the tumor microenvironment to regulate mechanosignaling in breast
cancer progression and metastasis. We propose to combine biochemical, 2D and 3D cell culture assays, and
in vivo xenograft models to elucidate EPHA2 signaling mechanisms in breast cancer malignancy induced by
ECM rigidity through three specific aims. (1) Determine how ECM rigidity activates EPHA2 non-canonical
signaling to promote EMT and invasion. (2) Determine how EPHA2 canonical signaling blocks EMT and
invasion induced by ECM rigidity. (3) Examine the role of EPHA2 non-canonical and canonical signaling in
breast cancer invasion and metastasis in vivo. Together, these studies will inform on the potential usefulness
of activating EphA2 canonical signaling for inhibition of breast cancer invasiveness and metastasis."

Nanoparticles (NPs) hold great promise as targeted drug delivery systems but tailoring their
pharmacokinetics (PK) to specifically target regions of interest remains a challenge. This limits
the clinical translation of NPs due to poor efficacy and safety concerns associated with off-target
accumulation of NP-based formulations. Due to the interactions of NPs with biological
components, driven by their structural properties, customizing the pharmacokinetics (PK) of NPs
requires a quantitative understanding of the effect of NP structural properties on their whole-body
biodistribution, which in turn also governs their safety profile. Therefore, to enable rational design
of NPs to achieve organ targeting and safety, we propose to leverage artificial intelligence to
develop a toxicology-integrated physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK-Tox)
capable of accurately predicting the whole-body exposure and safety of novel nanomaterials,
based solely on their structural properties, dose, and route of administration. For this, we will (1)
develop the PBPK-Tox model based on diverse datasets from literature, (2) establish the
quantitative relationship between NP properties, exposure, and toxicity, and (3) experimentally
test the model predictions of rational design to target one or more organs. Our proposed modeling
framework will enable efficient preclinical development of novel nanomaterials (and accelerate
their clinical translation) by providing rational design guidelines through in-depth computational
investigation of biological and physicochemical variability on biodistribution and safety of NPs."
10855491,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Several members of the orthopoxvirus (OPXV) genus, including variola (the cause of smallpox), monkeypox
virus (MPXV) and camelpox virus (CMPV) pose serious threats to human health, while the ultimate impact of
emerging OPXVs of concern such as Alaskapox virus (AKPV) is unknown. Other OPXVs are highly pathogenic
in their natural hosts, including ectromelia (ECTV), the cause of mousepox - a disease with many similarities to
smallpox. It is concerning, then, that the extreme virulence typical of the OPXVs remains poorly understood.
 Central to OPXV virulence are the virus-encoded proteins that impede host defenses. This proposal focuses
on members of the B22 family of OPXV immunoevasins due to their potency, complexity and limited
characterization. With respect to potency, MPXV197 significantly enhances mortality in a nonhuman primate
model, and ECTV C15 alone determines whether ECTV is 100% lethal or 100% survivable in a BALB/c mouse
infection model. With respect to complexity, B22 family members are exceedingly large (~1900 aa), highly
homologous multimembrane-spanning glycoproteins. We have observed that C15 is novel in targeting both
adaptive and innate host responses, preventing activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (TCD4 and TCD8), and
interfering with the ability of natural killer (NK) cells to engage infected cells. Other B22 members have been
implicated in hindering only TCD4 and/or TCD8 function; however, given the high degrees of homology, we suspect
common functionalities, including targeting of NK cells. With respect to limited characterization, essentially no
structure/function studies have been done with any B22 member. Through application of such studies to B22
members, key insights into OPXV virulence will be gained, potentially leading to novel therapeutic strategies and
enhanced general principles of viral virulence.
 Guided by published and preliminary data, we propose a model in which topologically complex B22 members
contain two functional subunits created by posttranslational cleavage: 1) an upstream (N-terminal) subunit that
interferes with NK cell recognition via an MHC class I-like structure. 2) a C-terminal subunit that inhibits
conjugation of TCD4 and TCD8 with their cognate targets. This model will be tested by pursuing three
complementary aims that: 1) reveal the structural properties of B22 members, 2) identify and map the functional
activities of B22 members, and 3) elucidate the viral and cellular binding partners of B22 proteins.
 The value of these studies derives from: a) the significance of many OPXV members as human pathogens,
b) the potency of B22 members as virulence factors, c) the enigmatic immunoevasion activities of B22 members,
and d) the potential for the proposed work to lead to new insights into virus:host interplay, the development of
novel antiviral strategies and many future lines of investigation, including elucidation of the advantage to
aggregating innate and adaptive immunoevasion activities into a single protein."
10827392,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a family of chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract that affect over 3 million Americans. While genetic background clearly plays a role, environmental factors, especially dietary nutrients, have been suspected as triggers to contribute to the disease development. Identifying the direct causal mechanisms by which genetics and dietary nutrients coordinately influence IBD susceptibility may provide direct utility in uncovering both how the disease develops and how it may be treated in the future. Although genetic factors appear to play relatively minor roles in IBD, there is one particular association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with IBD that showed up at the top of a recent genome-wide association screen in IBD: a common variant in the manganese transporter SLC39A8 (p.Ala391Thr). We and others have shown that this transporter is critical for the incorporation of manganese (Mn), a micronutrient required for many enzymatic activities. The SLC39A8 A391T variant was shown in vitro to have reduced Mn incorporating function, and we made similar observations independently. These revelations hint toward alterations in Mn levels caused by diet or genetics, as contributing factors for IBD. Yet, Mn deficiency has traditionally been rare in humans due to its various dietary sources. Mn is abundant in plant-based foods, including whole grains, rice, nuts, and leafy vegetables, whereas animal-based foods lack this nutrient. Recent epidemiological studies have revealed >40% reduction in dietary Mn consumption in the past 15 years due to a Western diet characterized by high intakes of red meats, high fat foods, and refined grains. This data is congruent with the increasing incidence of IBD, and it supports an inverse relationship between nutritional Mn levels and IBD patients. However, we still have not established if there is a causal role of Mn in IBD and the mechanism by which Mn contributes to IBD. This project will define functional insight into the roles of dietary Mn and SLC39A8 that maintain intestinal health, thereby advancing research into the etiology of IBD. Our findings will pave the way for future research in individuals at high risk of IBD to provide dietary recommendations and therapeutic targets."
10827394,"Protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, relies on precise control of protein synthesis, folding and degradation.
Proteostatic errors lead to protein aggregates, which are toxic and linked to neurodegenerative, cardiovascular,
muscular and metabolic disorders, and to premature aging. The ER and mitochondria are major sites for protein
folding and are supported by quality control mechanisms that correct protein folding or eliminate proteins or
organelles that are damaged beyond repair. ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and mitochondria-associated
degradation (MAD) are functionally and mechanistically related mechanisms. In both, misfolded proteins are
identified, ubiquitinated, extracted from organelles and degraded by the proteasome. However, both pathways
have limitations. Previous studies suggested that MAD proteostasis was restricted to mitochondrial outer mem-
brane (OM) proteins, <10% of mitochondrial proteins. Moreover, MAD and ERAD are inherently low-throughput
because they act on individual proteins. This limitation is a particular concern for ER, where 1/3 of all proteins in
the cell undergo folding, and protein entry into ER occurs at rates of 0.1-1 million proteins/minute. In the last
funding period, we found that MAD functions in proteostatic control of mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane
proteins. Consistent with this, we found that MAD and not chaperones, proteases or autophagy proteins, plays
a major role in mitochondrial and cellular fitness in a model for aging and that loss of MAD function results in
premature aging. We also reconstituted retrotranslocation of MAD substrates from the matrix in vitro and identi-
fied a role for the TOM channel, which imports proteins into mitochondria, in retrotranslocation of MAD substrates
out of the organelle. In complementary studies, we identified a novel ER proteostasis pathway that has overlap-
ping function with ERAD, but has higher throughput and contributes to the ER stress response in yeast, mam-
malian cells and cellular models for a newly identified congenital muscular dystrophy (CHKB CMD). In this path-
way, lipid droplets (LDs), organelles that form at ER membranes, act as escape hatches for large-scale removal
of unfolded ER proteins and degradation of those proteins and their LD carriers. Here, degradation occurs by
microautophagy, a conserved but understudied form of autophagy that does not rely on autophagosomes or core
ATG genes for delivery of cargoes to the vacuole (yeast lysosome). Rather, LD uptake occurs by direct contact
with the vacuole at invaginations of the vacuolar membrane, and LDs are released into the vacuolar lumen by
membrane scission mediated by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). Important fu-
ture goals are to understand the mechanism of MAD function within mitochondria, and the physiological conse-
quences of MAD-mediated mitochondrial proteostasis. Another important goal is to identify components and
functional consequences of ER-PERM, the pathway for ER proteostasis mediated by ESCRT and microlipoph-
agy, in yeast and mammalian cells. These studies will reveal mechanisms and functions of ER-PERM and targets
for treatment of CHKB CMD, a life-threatening disease for which there is no cure."

 Individuals with bipolar mood disorders (BD) experience severe and episodic emotion dysregulation. Our
existing pharmacological and psychosocial treatments fail to normalize emotion dysregulation for many bipolar
patients. We need new and innovative approaches to help improve emotion dysregulation for these patients.
The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the pathophysiology of emotion dysregulation in BD, and
to develop strategies to directly target and improve emotion regulation capacity. To this end, the candidate
proposes: (1) training objectives to acquire expertise in advanced network-based analysis of neuroimaging data
and training in the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a translational clinical and research tool;
(2) a research objective to identify patient-specific biomarkers of emotion dysregulation in BD and to
experimentally engage these targets using TMS; (3) a team of mentors and advisors to ensure the candidate’s
success, with expertise in bipolar disorder pathology and treatment (Dr. Andrew Nierenberg), advanced
network analysis of neuroimaging data (Dr. Randy Buckner), clinical and research applications of TMS (Dr.
Mark George and Dr. Joan Camprodon), neuromodulation of mood disorders (Dr. Darin Dougherty), emotion
regulation (Dr. James Gross), task-based neuroimaging in BD (Dr. Thilo Deckersbach), and advanced
statistical methods (Dr. Mark Vangel). The central hypothesis of the research proposal is that neuromodulation
of patient-specific targets of emotion regulation-related neurocircuitry using TMS will enhance the capacity for
emotion regulation in BD. The rationale for this proposal is that existing treatments don’t adequately address
severe emotion dysregulation in BD, thus new innovative approaches are needed. This project has the potential
to provide preliminary evidence for the future development of TMS as an innovative treatment strategy that
can be used adjunctive to existing treatments to improve emotion regulation in BD. Specific aims proposed are:
1) to identify patient-specific pathophysiological markers of implicit and explicit emotion dysregulation in BD;
2) to determine the effect of TMS on emotion regulation circuit dynamics in BD; and 3) to determine the effect
of TMS on emotion regulation behavioral responses in BD. The approach is innovative in that it uses a patient-
specific, precision medicine approach with combined TMS-fMRI to target and probe emotion dysregulation at
the level of neurocircuitry. The proposed research is significant, because it is has the potential to advance our
understanding of the pathophysiology of emotion dysregulation in BD and will provide crucial pilot data
towards testing the efficacy of TMS for improving emotion dysregulation in BD patients. Overall, the candidate
will use this project and its associated training to transition and expand this work into an independent program
of research developing neuroscience-informed interventions for bipolar mood disorders."
10827397,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 More than 37 million people are living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection worldwide which
continues to be a global public health problem. Despite the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), up to
70% of HIV-positive individuals suffer from cognitive and behavioral deficits collectively known as HIV-associated
neurocognitive disorders (HAND), for which no therapeutic options are currently available. Converging lines of
evidence indicate that the HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein plays a crucial role in causing
neurotoxicity and cognitive impairment in HAND. HIV-1 Tat exerts its neurotoxicity through interaction with crucial
proteins, such as the monoamine transporters in the central nervous system (CNS). The dysregulation of
dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in HAND occurs through direct interaction of Tat protein with the DA
transporter (DAT) which is essential for maintaining DA homeostasis and a target of cocaine. While most ARTs
cannot efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier, Tat-induced increase in DA levels accelerates viral replication in
the brain. Moreover, drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, exacerbate neurological impairments. Our published work
has demonstrated that Tat-induced inhibition of DAT is mediated by binding of Tat to allosteric binding site(s) on
DAT, not by interacting with the DA uptake site. This provides a basis for a novel approach to address the
problem by developing compounds to attenuate Tat binding to DAT by an allosteric mechanism. Our recent
studies with small molecule allosteric ligands of DAT reveal that these compounds are capable of attenuating
Tat-mediated effects on DAT, thus providing a potential opportunity to develop therapeutic interventions for the
treatment of HAND. The research effort proposed herein is to explore the hypothesis that disruption of Tat-DAT
interactions with small molecule allosteric ligands of DAT, with minimal disruption of normal DA uptake, will have
therapeutic potential for prevention of neurocognitive dysfunction in HAND. The primary goal of our research is
to optimize lead compounds and perform proof-of-concept pharmacological studies in animal models. To this
end, the specific aims to be pursed in the proposed effort are to: (1) design and synthesize novel allosteric
ligands with improved physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties using in silico property predictions and
computational docking studies with DAT-Tat complex models, (2) characterize the allosteric interaction of the
compounds with human DAT in vitro to identify optimized compounds with improved physicochemical properties
that can be used to alleviate Tat-induced dysfunction of DAT, and (3) determine the efficacy of selected
compounds in attenuating Tat-mediated cognitive deficits and rewarding effects of cocaine in inducible Tat
transgenic mice in vivo. This collaborative effort involves investigators with complementary expertise in medicinal
chemistry, drug design, and biochemical and behavioral studies with the long-term goal of developing drugs for
the treatment of HAND in HIV-positive patients."

This K24 application seeks to provide protected time for Dr. Elena Myasoedova to mentor trainees in patient-
oriented research (POR) aiming at defining the long-term temporal relationship between systemic inflammation,
cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular events on the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease and other related
dementias (ADRD), using rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a prototype. This award will enable the applicant to solidify
and advance her current NIA-funded R01 research program in new directions and to expand her mentoring
opportunities and mentoring experience. Dr. Myasoedova is a tenure-track Associate Professor at Mayo Clinic.
She has a strong and ongoing record of high-quality POR, publication, and mentoring in research directly related
to the proposed studies. The applicant has shown significant abilities in mentoring trainees at all career stages
and will continue to benefit from the rich and robust resources, unique research infrastructure and a large pool
of patients and mentees at Mayo Clinic. During the funding period, further development of the applicant will
include: 1) Improvement in mentorship skills in POR; 2) Enhancement of knowledge in biostatistics for POR; 3)
Development of a collaborative niche for POR in aging and ADRD in rheumatic diseases; and 4) Maintaining
uninterrupted extramural funding. These goals will be achieved through a combination of seminars, meetings,
courses, and collaboration with the Division of Epidemiology, the Kogod Center on Aging, the Rochester
Epidemiology Project and the Mayo Clinic Study on Aging. Dr. Myasoedova will further integrate and advance
these skills through continued mentorship of trainees within currently funded POR and through expansion of her
ADRD research through the K24 mechanism. Research aims of the proposal include: 1) Examining the temporal
association between cardiovascular risk factors, systemic inflammation and ADRD in RA; 2) Evaluating direct
and cardiovascular-mediated effects of chronic inflammation on ADRD in RA; and 3) Defining the population
attributable risk (PAR) of RA characteristics on incident mild cognitive impairment and ADRD, overall and by
sex. The proposed studies will inform risk stratification of ADRD in a chronic inflammatory setting of RA overall
and by sex as a key step for advancing the understanding of ADRD risk and developing prevention strategies in
patients with RA and beyond. These aims are well-aligned with NIA’s Goal D to improve our understanding of
the aging brain and ADRD, specifically defining the impact of inflammatory processes on the development of
AD, and whether systemic risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease during midlife
are associated with accelerated age-related cognitive decline and with increased risk for AD. Successful
completion of this award will facilitate the development of the next generation of patient-oriented researchers in
ADRD and will expand Dr. Myasoedova’s POR program to ensure continued mentoring opportunities into the
future, aligning with the NIA’s mission to “Foster the development of research and clinician scientists in aging’."

Adipose tissue is a critical endocrine mediator of metabolic health that is functionally altered during aging and
obesity. Our data demonstrate that dietary protein restriction (DPR) increases whole body glucose
homeostasis and energy expenditure and protects against age-related metabolic decline, and that these
metabolic effects are associated with a remodeling of white adipose tissue that includes increased thermogenic
markers and adiponectin secretion. This project tests the hypothesis that the remodeling of adipose tissue
during dietary protein restriction directly improves metabolic health during aging. This model will be tested by
assessing the transcriptional and cell signaling pathways in adipose tissue that contribute to glucose
homeostasis and insulin sensitivity and determining which of these are altered during DPR in an age-
dependent fashion. Lastly, we will test whether increases in adiponectin contribute to whole body
improvements in glucose homeostasis during protein restriction, and whether using adipose tissue grafts from
protein restricted mice combats age-related insulin resistance in an adiponectin-dependent manner."

Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and progressive disease characterized by the scarring and stiffening of lung
tissue. Patients have poor quality of life, and usually die within 2-5 years. The only curative measure is lung
transplantation, which is not an option for most patients. The primary catalyst of fibrosis, TGF-β, activates
alveolar fibroblasts to become profibrotic fibroblasts, which deposit excess extracellular matrix protein and
take-on an anti-apoptotic phenotype. TGF-β has been difficult to therapeutically target due to its universal
expression and role in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis. Systemic inhibitors risk toxicity. This study aims
to use chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy combined with an inducible drug delivery circuit to target
profibrotic fibroblasts. The inducible circuit using Synthetic Intramembrane Proteolysis Receptors (SNIPRs)
drives a response element payload of potent TGF-β inhibitor TβRII-Fc. I am currently engineering CARs and
SNIPRs that target membrane-bound extracellular proteins that are specifically and highly expressed on
profibrotic fibroblasts, Lrrc15, TEM1, and Gremlin 1. The specificity of my targets limits unintended cell killing
or inhibitor release. I anticipate that local TβRII-Fc release will reprogram and prevent the induction of
profibrotic fibroblasts. For my thesis project, I will be testing the performance of engineered CARs and SNIPRs
that target profibrotic fibroblasts and evaluating the efficacy of CAR-T SNIPR -> TβRII-Fc T cells in an in vivo
model of pulmonary fibrosis. In Aim 1, I will take 41BBζ CAR and SNIPR construct backbones and individually
clone-in short chain variable fragments (scFvs) with high binding affinities to my proteins of interest, Lrrc15,
TEM1, or Gremlin 1. For each target, I will test CAR-T cell proliferation and killing ability, SNIPR response
element activation, and the inhibition of TGF-β signaling (pSmad2/3) in vitro. I have bred mice that express
membrane-bound GFP on profibrotic fibroblasts when treated with tamoxifen (Cthrc1-CreERT2-mGFP). The Lim
Laboratory has already tested and optimized anti-GFP CARs and SNIPR circuits. In Aim 2, I will test the ability
of anti-GFP SNIPR-TβRII-Fc CAR-T cells to target membrane-bound GFP on profibrotic fibroblasts and
ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis in a bleomycin mouse model. Fibrosis will be measured by lung collagen content
(hydroxyproline) and the amount of profibrotic fibroblasts present at endpoint. If successful, this project will
broaden the applications of cell-based therapies beyond cancer to the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis and
other complex diseases."

X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is a fully penetrant and lethal neurodegenerative disorder in which
symptoms of dystonia overlap with degenerative parkinsonism, reflective of the gradual loss of striatal neurons
as the disease progresses. XDP represents a unique Mendelian disorder that offers the opportunity to study
dysfunction in the basal ganglia given the genetic, mechanistic, and phenotypic overlaps with other forms of
dystonia, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and the tauopathies. Our initially funded program
developed an innovative genome and transcriptome assembly approach, coupled with extensive neuronal
modeling, to discover that an SVA insertion into intron 32 of the TAF1 gene was associated aberrant
transcriptional signatures that included intron retention (IR) and alternative splicing (AS), as well as reduction of
TAF1 expression in patient derived neural stem cells (NSCs) and induced neurons (iNs). This mutation was also
associated with global changes in neurodevelopmental and inflammation pathways, consistent with the functions
of TAF1 as a key transcriptional regulator. We surprisingly found that age-at-onset and disease expression were
modified by a variable hexameric repeat within the SVA, and that CRISPR-excision of the SVA rescued all
transcriptional aberrations in XDP, suggesting a path to amelioration. In this renewal, we will leverage strong
new preliminary results that suggest: 1) antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) can alter TAF1 splicing in XDP; 2) all
molecular signatures discovered in neuronal cell models are confirmed in postmortem brain tissue from XDP
cases and are tissue-specific; 3) there is clear evidence of tau accumulation in XDP postmortem brain tissues.
To pursue our foundational discoveries and new findings, we will conduct a series of studies across a highly
complementary team of investigators to define the pathogenic mechanisms and possible targeted therapies for
XDP. Aim 1 will apply ASO therapies to manipulate AS and IR in neuronal models and modulate TAF1
expression, then explore the perturbation and rescue of molecular signatures. Aim 2 will use a unique XDP brain
bank to study the transcriptomic and proteopathic features of XDP in postmortem brains, where our preliminary
data indicate that neuropathologic changes in XDP are consistent with a previously unrecognized tauopathy. We
will systematically profile and quantify the burden of tau across multiple brain regions, as well as the biochemical
and structural characteristics of pathologic tau in XDP. Using patient biosamples, we will also seek potential
biomarkers of this pathology. Aim 3 will then integrate ASO/CRISPR targeting and tau dynamics with prior data
that support a role for inflammation and iron-mediated toxicity in XDP. We will develop neuron:glial co-cultures,
and characterize the responses of these cell types to tau, iron, and inflammatory stimuli. These interdisciplinary
and interconnected aims will provide broad mechanistic and therapeutic insights into this unique Mendelian
disorder with profound implications for more common neurodegenerative diseases."

 Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc) is a thermally dimorphic fungus that is thought to be the most common
cause of fungal respiratory infections in healthy humans. Hc grows in a multicellular hyphal form in the
environment. Once inhaled by mammals, Hc converts to a unicellular yeast form that colonizes macrophages.
Temperature is a key signal that is sufficient to trigger the switch from the soil to host form (and vice versa); in
the laboratory, room temperature promotes hyphal (mold-form) growth whereas 37ºC promotes yeast-phase
growth. The long-term goal of this research is to determine the molecular basis of how temperature regulates
morphology and virulence in thermally dimorphic fungi. By elucidating how Hc cells sense and respond to host
temperature, we will define critical molecular landmarks that promote changes in morphology as well as the
expression of virulence traits. In previous work, we identified four transcription factors, Ryp1, 2, 3, and 4, that
promote yeast-form growth in response to host temperature. The Ryp proteins are absolutely required for yeast-
phase morphology as well for the vast majority of the temperature-dependent gene expression program. Over
the last funding period, we uncovered evidence that Ryp1 and Ryp2 are regulated post-transcriptionally.
Additionally, to identify regulatory mechanisms that antagonize the Ryp pathway at low temperature, we isolated
yeast-locked mutants that inappropriately activate the Ryp pathway in the absence of the normal high
temperature signal. We determined that the cell surface signaling mucin Msb2 is required for (1) inhibition of Ryp
accumulation and (2) establishment of hyphal growth in response to low temperature. Additionally, transcriptional
profiling of the msb2 mutant allowed us to identify compact gene regulons that are associated with either hyphal
formation or yeast-phase growth, including the identification of putative virulence factors whose expression is
associated with growth in the yeast form independent of temperature. Here we will (1) investigate how
temperature regulates the Histoplasma pathogenic program by elucidating the molecular mechanisms that
regulate the Ryp pathway; (2) elucidate how the Ryp and Msb2 pathways, which oppose each other, are able to
sense temperature; and (3) utilize our temperature-defined regulatory circuits for virulence gene discovery.
These experiments will result in a detailed molecular understanding of how temperature triggers critical cell fate
changes that are linked to the ability of Hc to cause disease."

Project Summary: (30 lines)
The long-term goal of this project is to understand how cells control their sensitivity to external stimuli.
Macrophages are a particularly interesting example of this because they constantly encounter background
stimuli, like IgG, in their surrounding environment. Macrophage signaling pathways are carefully tuned to
rapidly detect IgG-bound pathogens without reacting to healthy cells. Macrophages respond to IgG by
activating phagocytosis and/or inflammation. The short-term goal of this project is to define how macrophages
set a response threshold for these outputs. We are approaching this problem from two directions. The first
direction is examining how receptor clustering or co-clustering affects macrophage sensitivity. Our previous
data shows that clustering of activating ligands enhances activation of the Fc Receptor, and increases
phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is also controlled by inhibitory ‘Don’t eat me’ signals on viable cells. We are now
expanding our studies to examine how clustering of inhibitory ligands, and co-clustering of inhibitory and
activating ligands affects phagocytosis. This will suggest how ligand or receptor pattern can tune macrophage
sensitivity. Our second direction is examining the intracellular signaling that filters out sub-threshold stimuli.
Our preliminary data suggests that a higher IgG signal is required for inflammation than phagocytosis. We will
address the following questions: What parameter do macrophages measure to determine IgG signal intensity –
signal duration, IgG density, or total number of IgG molecules? What is the molecular breakpoint in the IgG
signaling pathway that is only activated by high IgG? How does IgG stimulus intensity affect signaling
dynamics in the NFkB and MAPK signaling pathways? Overall, this will suggest how macrophages are able
generate two separate responses from a single input based on dose."

 Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is an age-related and progressive lung disease characterized by loss of
the normal alveolar architecture and accumulation of scarring tissue replacing the functional lung parenchyma.
One of the main characteristics is the loss of alveolar epithelial type II stem cells (AT2), with the concurrence
appearance of transitional AT2 cells. This aberrant alveolar epithelial cell co-expresses genes of AT2, AT1, and
airway epithelial cells simultaneously. Although transient AT2 epithelial cells are enriched in areas of severe
fibrosis, the mechanisms involved in remodeling and lung fibrosis remain poorly understood.
 Our preliminary data show that under normal conditions, AT2 actively metabolizes long fatty acids by fatty
acid oxidation (FAO). As the mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to acyl-CoA FA, the outer membrane
mitochondrial protein, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A/1B (CPT1a/CPT1b), catalyzes transport step of the lipid
metabolism been the limiting rate of this pathway. In the lung, in AT2 from aging and IPF lungs, there is a
decrease in the expression of the CPT1a with reduced levels of Acetyl CoA, an FAO metabolite. To determine if
FAO is essential for the repair responses, we developed CPT1a deficient cell lines and a conditional AT2-CPT1a
deficient mouse. Using these tools, we have found that: 1) expression and activity of CPT1a in AT2 cells is
required for the protection against injury-induced lung fibrosis, 2) deficiency of CPT1a enhances markers of
transitional AT2 stem cells, with markers of TGFβ1 activation, and cellular senescence, 3) CPT1a regulates TGF-
β1 signaling by acetylation and degradation of the negative regulator Smad7, and 4) deficiency of CPT1a
engages histone hypoacetylation in lung epithelial cells. These observations have led to the hypothesis that FAO
regulates AT2 differentiation by epigenetic reprogramming via modulation of acetyl-CoA levels. A deficiency of
FAO triggers AT2 differentiation into a transient aberrant AT2 without reaching a terminal AT1 differentiation,
decreasing the resilience against lung fibrosis. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims:
 Aim 1. To examine the hypothesis that acetyl-CoA FAO generated in AT2 cells regulates
epigenetically and transcriptionally AT2 differentiation. Acetyl CoA generated in the mitochondria via FAO
is an essential metabolite linking metabolic and nuclear programs influencing AT2 differentiation.
 Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that AT2 CPT1a expression confers resilience against the development
of lung fibrosis. Our preliminary data show defective FAO in aging AT2 cells, and deficiency of CPT1a/FAO in
AT2 increases susceptibility to tissue remodeling associated with pulmonary fibrosis.
Completion of these aims will enhance our understanding of the role of CPT1a and FAO in the wound healing
process and age-related mechanisms of resilience to disrepair and fibrosis."

YME1 is an ATP-dependent protease located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and plays a central role in
executing the functional activities of the mitochondrial protein quality control network. Preserving homeostasis
within the mitochondria is critical to maintaining cellular health and preventing a wide range of human diseases
resulting from the dysfunction of the mitochondria, including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular
disorders, and cancer. YME1 is capable of proteolytically processing a wide variety of diverse mitochondrial
substrates through regulatory mechanisms that remain largely unknown. One of the most intriguing aspects of
YME1 proteolytic activity arises from its unique ability to perform molecular decision-making: YME1 can choose
to perform 1) processive degradation of a target substrate, whereby it cleaves the substrate into small peptides,
or 2) site-specific cleavage through which the substrate undergoes a single cleavage event and is subsequently
released by YME1. One of the most well-characterized of these site-specific cleavage functions is the cleavage
of the optical atrophy 1 (OPA1) protein, which is implicated in age-related eye disease, at an internal loop by the
human YME1 protein (YME1L). This cleavage event produces two isoforms of OPA1, the ratio of which is crucial
to regulating mitochondrial morphology and function. However, despite much investigation into the mechanistic
bases for molecular decision-making performed by YME1 proteins, the atomic drivers that distinguish between
these two degradation modes remain elusive. Yeast YME1 shares high sequence conservation with human
YME1L, especially at the catalytic sites, making it an excellent molecular model for investigating this substrate
processing mechanism. Interestingly, the site-specific cleavage of the yeast chaperone protein Tim10 occurs at
a site that shares high sequence conservation with that of human OPA1. Thus, insights gained from studies of
proteolytic processing in yeast YME1 have a strong potential to apply broadly to this mechanism in human
YME1L as well as related ATP-dependent proteases. This work will focus on elucidating the mechanistic details
that define how YME1 selects and distinctly processes protein substrates based on its sequence and folded
state. The details of this mechanism will be investigated in two Aims. The first aim will combine structural and
biochemical studies to examine how structural components of YME1 perceive and respond to specific sequences
within targeted substrates. The second Aim will explore how YME1 switches between processing modalities
based on a difference in the folding stability of the targeted substrate. These combined structure-function studies
will define the molecular underpinnings that regulate two distinct functional activities of an ATP-dependent
protease that are required for mitochondrial health. The outcomes of this study will provide a comprehensive
model of the regulation of proteolytic processing by YME1, that will enhance our understanding of human YME1L
function, and how perturbations of its function are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and human disease."

The goal of this proposal is to develop a platform created from advanced biomaterials that enable novel
investigations into the physiochemical roles of the tumor microenvironment (TME) on the origins of
colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. and is increasing in
incidence. Virtually all of these tumors arise from adenomas or polyps whose progression to cancer is
driven by physical and chemical changes within the TME in concert with genetic mutations. Although
much is known about the genetics of colon cancer, relatively little is understood about how the
physicochemical properties of the surrounding TME matrix impact the process of cancer initiation.
Current evidence does suggest that these TME alterations are critical to adenoma formation and
progression to cancer. To advance our understanding of this process, an interdisciplinary group of
internationally renowned investigators with expertise in materials science, bioengineering, optical
platforms, intestinal stem cell biology and oncology has been assembled to create a 4D-tunable
hydrogel to study how these TME alterations impact the development of colorectal cancer. Advanced
light-activated hydrogels and their fabrication in forming an accurate model of the colonic architecture
at the micron scale will be extensively optimized and characterized. The light activatable biomaterials
with controllable physiochemical properties will then form a foundational component of a colon
microphysiologic system (MPS). Human intestinal cells will reside on the new biomatrix scaffolding
possessing photo-controlled stiffness in both space and time and supporting formation of chemical
gradients. To take full advantage of the new biomaterials tool set, a customized light-sheet platform and
imaging cassette compatible with application of gradients of growth factors and oxygen will be
developed to support the living colonic tissue on this bioengineered scaffold. The platform will enable
high-quality imaging of large numbers of colonic crypts to generate data sets of sufficient size for
statistical comparisons and hypothesis testing. This humanized, architecturally and physiochemically
accurate biomaterials platform will then be used to reveal key characteristics of the TME’s influence on
the hallmarks of cancer demonstrating the utility of these advanced biomaterials in studies of colon and
other cancer types."

Project Summary/Abstract
Natural product synthesis contributes significantly to the identification and development of
potential therapeutics. Retrosynthetic analysis of a natural product target demands innovation at
all levels of study, giving rise to the design of novel reaction technology and creative application
of established reactivity to provide access to structures with pharmaceutical potential.
Tetracyclic triterpenoid natural products present a challenging landscape for synthetic organic
chemists to explore novel chemical transformations. More than one hundred FDA-approved
drugs are tetracyclic triterpenoids. Cardenolides are a class of tetracyclic triterpenoid natural
products with many members having demonstrated medically-relevant biological activity, but
further investigation of their pharmaceutical potential is hindered by limited access to natural
sources and a lack of reported approaches to synthesis of the cardenolide carbon framework.
The research project proposed herein would report a solution to key challenges to cardenolide
synthesis—C10 and C13 quaternary centers, C14 tertiary alcohol, and C17 substitution (steroid
numbering)—thus establishing an asymmetric de novo synthesis of a cardenolide natural
product, sarmentogenin. A novel oxidative dearomatization/Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement,
in which a 1,2-methyl shift from C9 to C10 would establish the quaternary center at C10 and
oxidation in the C-ring. This synthesis would be an application of a recently reported
methodology from the Micalizio group to install C17 substitution, a historically significant
challenge to completing the total synthesis of cardenolide natural products. The long-term
success of the project proposed herein would be a report of a cardenolide total synthesis,
paving the way for future investigations of pharmaceutically-relevant cardenolide bioactivity. The
fellowship award would support continued graduate research and training in the Micalizio
laboratory at Dartmouth College. The Micalizio group has a well-established program for
developing novel reaction technology to concisely synthesize complex natural product targets.
The research supported by the award would take place in an established organic synthesis
laboratory with all necessary equipment for the preparation, purification, and characterization of
organic compounds."

The process of cell division requires that each cell receive an identical complement of the genome. Errors in
chromosome segregation give rise to chromosomal aneuploidies that are causative for human genetic disease
such as Down syndrome and promote the progression of most human cancers. The work in this proposal is
focused on understanding the functions of the centromere and kinetochore, the primary site on the
chromosome that attaches each chromosome to the mitotic spindle for proper segregation during division. The
centromere and kinetochore serve as the primary control center for chromosome segregation through their
roles in microtubule attachment, force coupling for chromosome movement, and error correction when
chromosome attachment or alignment on microtubules is perturbed. Underlying the centromere is a specialized
chromatin domain that is delineated by replacement of histone H3 in nucleosomes with a centromere specific
histone variant termed CENP-A. The position of CENP-A defines where the centromere and kinetochore will
form and defects in CENP-A assembly or maintenance cause centromere and kinetochore loss which result in
chromosome missegregation. In this proposal we study three different aspects of CENP-A chromatin. In our
first Aim we work to understand how the assembly of CENP-A chromatin is controlled so that the centromere is
replenished during each cell cycle and maintained through replication and cell division. We focus on three
important factors for CENP-A assembly, CENP-C, HJURP and the Mis18 complex that are essential for
building new CENP-A nucleosomes at centromeres. Our second aim studies the problem of how the presence
of CENP-A in chromatin dictates the sites of new CENP-A assembly. We apply a new method we have
developed called DiMeLo-seq that overcomes existing limitations in studying the complex repetitive
centromeres of vertebrates. This approach uses directed methylation to mark the sites where proteins are
bound to chromatin and then uses long read sequencing to map the binding sites through the repetitive
centromere sequences. We use this approach to study the density, distribution, and sites of regeneration of
CENP-A through the cell cycle. In our third aim we study how centromeres are condensed and organized by
the activities of CENP-A nucleosome binding proteins. We discovered that two centromere proteins (CENP-C
and CENP-N) can bridge CENP-A nucleosomes and condense centromeric chromatin. We use human cells to
test the role of this condensation activity in centromere condensation, resistance to force, and chromosome
segregation. Overall, our proposal will elucidate the regulatory mechanisms and structural organization of
vertebrate centromeres and how those properties ensure accurate chromosome segregation."

Stem cell therapy (SCT) has displayed immense potential in a variety of regenerative medicine applications
through tissue remodeling and repair. Stem cells (SCs) not only repair injured tissue through direct differentiation
towards mesenchyme lineages, but they also have a multitude of paracrine mechanisms which help in
regeneration. Mesenchymal SCs (MSCs) are the most used SCs due to their easy isolation (from bone marrow
or discarded adipose tissue), no ethical concerns and straightforward maintenance. However, SCT has not
achieved clinical acceptance due to a variety of limiting factors such as injections to incorrect locations, lack of
cell retention, poor viability of transplanted MCSs, and a high risk of protumorigenic activity. Among these a
major roadblock to translation is the ability of transplanted MSCs to differentiate into cancer associated
fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs contribute to immune escape of tumors via multiple mechanisms, including secretion
of multiple cytokines and chemokines and reciprocal interactions that mediate the recruitment of immune cells.
Moreover, CAFs directly abrogate the function of cytotoxic lymphocytes, thus inhibiting killing of tumor cells.
Clinical stem cell therapy is severely hindered by the lack of spatial and functional information about the fate of
implanted cells in vivo. There is a great need for imaging tools that can provide non-invasive and longitudinal
information about the location of MSCs and the differentiation of MSCs to CAFs. Present methods to determine
therapeutic outcomes are all invasive end-point analyses such as histology and biomarker assays, which cause
damage to regenerating tissue and do not reflect the real-time dynamics of the microenvironment. This project
presents a stimuli-responsive ultrasound guided photoacoustic (US/PA) nanosensor consisting of a gold
nanosphere modified with a LOXL2-responsive triblock peptide. The nanosensor is designed for US/PA
monitoring of MSC location and detection of MSC differentiation to CAFs. The triblock peptide sequence is
selectively cleaved by LOXL2 upon differentiation to CAF phenotypes, which triggers hydrophobic aggregation
of the gold nanospheres leading to enhanced optical absorption in the first near-infrared optical window.
The overall hypotheses of the project are that US/PA imaging of MSCs augmented with LOXL2-responsive
plasmonic nanosensors will enable real-time spatial tracking of transplanted MSCs and allow monitoring of their
differentiation to CAFs in vivo. This approach will facilitate communication between the transplanted SCs and
researchers or clinicians. Successful completion of the aims will (i) showcase and validate a versatile nanosensor
platform for the functional monitoring of transplanted MSCs via integration of non-invasive US/PA imaging with
cell nanoengineering techniques, (ii) perform in vivo real-time US/PA guided tracking of nanosensor augmented
MSCs and their differentiation into CAFs in clinically relevant models, and (iii) enable optimization of transplanted
MSC dose, location, and periodicity for safer and improved SCT through real-time therapeutic planning."

This project is a continuation of the work proposed in the original K99 application. Having secured a tenure- track assistant professorship at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, the remaining work will be carried out at that institution. The aims proposed here are substantively unchanged from those originally proposed for the independent phase of the award. The ability to flexibly adapt to changing circumstance is critical for navigating through the world. In order to effectively use cues from the environment to inform choices and guide decisions, irrelevant cues must be effectively ignored, and often an appropriate response in one situation becomes inappropriate in another. This type of behavior, referred to as set-shifting, represents a form of cognitive flexibility. Chronic stress can impair the ability to set-shift and may be related to the impairments in set-shifting that accompany psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression, as well as neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. An extensive body of research in humans and in translational animal models has established a critical role for the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in maintaining cognitive flexibility. However, the precise anatomical and information processing characteristics of the neural circuits within the PFC that enable this behavior remain unknown. Here I propose to leverage powerful imaging techniques to survey the activity of specific populations of prefrontal neurons in a mouse performing a set-shifting task. First, lab members will follow up on preliminary findings that chronic stress results in a deficit in cognitive flexibility by examining the task-related coding properties of projection-specific neuronal populations in mice undergoing chronic stress. The goal of this project will be to determine the effect of stress on behaviorally relevant information coding among prefrontal neurons. Second, lab members will examine the effects of prefrontal glutamate release on stress-induced deficits in cognitive flexibility by testing whether this deficit can be rescued by pharmacogenetic activation of glutamatergic signaling in prefrontal projection neurons. Third, lab members will extend the investigation of the effects of stress on prefrontal activity by using high-speed imaging to examine the effects of stress on rapid, network-level state transitions. Together, these experiments will advance our understanding of the role of the prefrontal cortex in supporting behavior related to cognitive flexibility and of the circuit-level mechanisms by which stress may impair cognitive flexibility in psychiatric illness-related cognitive deficits."

In 2017, more than 550,000 people became sick with a strain of tuberculosis (TB) that was resistant to rifampin
and isoniazid, the two most potent drugs in the standard first-line TB regimen. Historically, treatment for patients
with multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB has been long, toxic, and ineffective: on average, only 55% of treated patients
were cured at the end of the conventional 18- to 24-month regimen, which included a daily injection for
approximately eight months. In 2012 and 2013 regulatory authorities conditionally approved the first new TB
drugs in fifty years, bedaquiline (BDQ) and delamanid (DLM), offering hope for more effective and less toxic
MDR-TB treatment. In early 2019, based on the best available evidence, the World Health Organization (WHO)
issued new guidelines for MDR-TB treatment. These guidelines included a new priority drug ranking for the
composition of MDR-TB regimens, which established BDQ as an anchor of an injectable-free 18- to 24-month
regimen and endorsed a standardized nine-month regimen containing an injectable.
Although conventional injectable-free and shortened injectable-containing MDR-TB regimens represent
enormous improvements, these new guidelines deferred guidance on a number of key questions for which
evidence is lacking, leaving many national TB programs uncertain about how to implement MDR-TB treatment.
For example, although recommendations guide the overall duration of treatment, there was no recommendation
on the optimal duration of use of each drug. Moreover, there is no data on the safety or effectiveness of the
regimen comprising the five top priority drugs. A lack of high quality MDR-TB cohort data also prevented
guidance on other urgent questions, including (1) the safety and effectiveness of common off-label uses of BDQ
and DLM, (e.g., co-administration and extended use of the drugs); and (2) whether BDQ or DLM could be
substituted into the recommended nine-month regimen. In the absence of clinical trial data to address these
questions, robust, valid causal inference from observational MDR-TB cohort data is of paramount importance to
guaranteeing optimal treatment—and minimizing death, morbidity, and disease transmission—for MDR-TB
patients throughout the United States and the world.
The endTB initiative, implemented by our group, offers a unique opportunity to generate high-quality evidence
to inform MDR-TB treatment and care. The endTB observational cohort of 2,600 MDR-TB patients treated with
BDQ and/or DLM in 17 countries—the largest, systematically-collected prospective dataset of its kind. Detailed
longitudinal data will permit robust analyses to inform lingering, critical questions, prioritized by the World Health
Organization. We will exploit this unique resource, strong partnerships in high-MDR-TB-burden countries, and
advanced expertise in epidemiologic methods to identify optimal MDR-TB regimens; inform optimal use of and
adverse event monitoring for BDQ and DLM, and illustrate how combinations of robust, longitudinal data and
novel methods can reduce these biases."
10829826,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) of the hair follicle can serve as a reservoir for melanocyte replenishment
to the epidermal layer of the skin. This property has been demonstrated in patients with the depigmentation
disease vitiligo, in which new pigmentation is found in a peri-follicular pattern surrounding hair follicles, following
treatment with narrow-band ultraviolet B radiation (UVB). Unfortunately, repigmentation through UVB therapy is
neither widespread nor durable. On the other hand, McSCs harboring mutations can serve as cells of origin for
melanoma, the deadliest of skin cancers. Melanoma in this context can be initiated by the activation of McSCs
in response to UVB exposure. It is our long-term goal to identify the molecular mechanisms through which UVB
alters the activation and migration of McSCs to ultimately provide a significant impact leading to the improvement
of vitiligo treatment and new methods of melanoma prevention.
 Our preliminary data indicate that a pro-inflammatory state in the skin, induced by UVB exposure,
facilitates McSC translocation to the epidermis and melanoma initiation from mutant McSCs. We have also
shown that loss of function in the architectural chromatin remodeling factor Hmga2 results in impairment of both
McSC translocation and melanoma initiation through a cell extrinsic mechanism. The underlying molecular
events through which inflammation and Hmga2 regulate these processes have not been identified. TNF
signaling and neutrophil/macrophage recruitment have been determined as potential mediators of McSC
proliferation and migration, and melanoma initiation from McSCs. It is the central hypothesis of this proposal
that UVB-mediated McSC translocation, and melanoma initiation from McSCs, requires inflammatory cell influx
and TNF signaling, which is induced by tissue-specific Hmga2 transcriptional regulation.
 In this proposal, we will test whether specific cell populations and signaling pathways are responsible for
UVB-mediated McSC translocation and melanoma initiation via Aim 1) directed at the necessity of inflammation
mediated recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages, Aim 2) directed at the necessity and sufficiency of
cytokine signaling mediated by Tnf-alpha, and Aim 3) directed at defining the cell population and downstream
transcription changes dependent upon Hmga2. Our approach will utilize our innovative model system to define
these processes in vivo, using deletion/overexpression by cell specific genetic manipulation, antibody and small
molecule neutralization of cell populations and signaling pathways, and transcriptomic profiling on isolated cell
populations. Understanding and conclusively defining the cell populations and transcriptomic changes occurring
during UVB-mediated McSC translocation and melanoma initiation will lead to testing of novel strategies for
vitiligo treatment and melanoma prevention. These goals are directly in line with the mission at NIAMS to
improve the health of patients suffering from skin diseases."

10830092,"MODELING ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES AND DISEASE FACILITY CORE - ABSTRACT
The Modeling Environmental Exposures and Disease Facility Core (MEED) provides systems modeling as well
as data science methods and computational tools that support and complement field and laboratory studies
conducted by CEED investigators. These methods and tools help to elucidate how environmental exposures can
lead to disease, and to translate these findings to prevention and mitigation strategies that reduce adverse health
outcomes. MEED supports a wide range of computational approaches, applicable across multiple environmental
and biological scales, for assessing and modeling events and processes that occur along the continuum from
source of environmental stressors to human exposures and to target tissue doses and biological responses. In
particular, the Core Co-Directors, Hao Zhu and Panos Georgopoulos have been developing and applying novel
“hybrid” computational frameworks that combine mechanism-driven systems simulations with data-driven
interpretable machine learning methods for predictive toxicology and exposure science applications. MEED
provides support to CEED investigators in quantifying environmental exposures and biological processes
associated with xenobiotics at the systems level, accounting for different system components, interactions, and
functional states. To achieve its goals, MEED has three aims: Aim 1. Provide state-of-the-art data science
(informatics) tools for the analysis and integration of complex heterogeneous socioeconomic, environmental,
chemical, and biological data relevant to environmental health; Aim 2. Develop/adapt mechanistic models for
environmental and biological processes to support spatiotemporal estimation of exposures and simulate internal
doses and processes linking exposures to disease pathogenesis; and Aim 3. Work with community partners and
the Community Engagement Core (CEC) to identify and model exposures and risks of concern at the community
or individual levels as a function of geography, lifestyle/behavior, socioeconomic conditions, and host factors.
The core focuses on overburdened communities and populations at-risk, modeling and translating exposures
and health outcomes associated with intervention strategies developed through our community partnerships.
Examples of projects supported by MEED that will be expanded in scope during the next grant period include:
(a) Modeling climate change dynamics and global-to-local impacts on environmental stressor exposures; a
special focus of this effort is on supporting local Environmental and Climate Justice assessments; (b) Modeling
complex toxic exposures in overburdened and at-risk populations; applications involve PFAS mixtures, air toxics,
mycoestrogens, and others; (c) Modeling multiscale pulmonary and multi-organ toxicodynamic responses to
inhalation of oxidative stress agents such as ozone and nanoparticles; (d) High-throughput toxicity and risk
screening methods for chemicals and nanomaterials; and (e) Prognostic/diagnostic modeling of COVID-19
across New Jersey, assessing the impact of multiple social and environmental factors on disease outcomes."
10830093,"COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE - ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of the CEED Community Engagement Core (CEC) is to support the strategic vision of
CEED to address the environmental health concerns of all NJ residents by centering our efforts on its most
affected populations. CEC works with communities and CEED researchers to characterize the health risks that
people face in their daily lives, translate existing research evidence to action to reduce exposure and risks, and
identify new research directions that are aligned with community environmental health needs. CEC aims to 1)
Integrate community environmental health concerns with the overall CEED vision; 2) Improve environmental
health and reduce health disparities by building capacity in communities and within the Center to address
environmental health risks; and 3) Respond directly to community health needs and concerns by facilitating
community-engaged research (CEnR). To accomplish these aims, CEC establishes and nurtures active, long-
standing relationships with community partners who have common goals to improve environmental public health.
Through regular meetings and bidirectional communications, CEC facilitates sharing of diverse perspectives
between community partners and CEED scientists, increasing understanding of community concerns and ways
that environmental health science can address those concerns, reduce risk, and improve health. The CEC
Working Group meets monthly with CEC leadership and Community Advisory Board (CAB) members to plan
activities that include an annual NJ Environmental Health and Justice Summit. The CEC builds community
capacity to engage in research through an Environmental Health Ambassadors program and future scientist
programs, as well as CEnR projects addressing community concerns about traffic-related air pollution, local
impacts of climate change, and legacy and emerging drinking water contaminants. Communication and
engagement with community partners will be enhanced with more opportunities for in-depth dialog and co-
learning workshops. Training modules in environmental public health will facilitate the ability of CEED members
and community partners to participate in review of cumulative impacts assessments and permit decisions under
the state’s new environmental justice regulations. These sessions will build on Center strengths in geospatial
mapping, community air monitoring, and cumulative risk assessment. CEC will support increased participation
of community organizations in the Pilot Project Program by: 1) assisting community-scientist teams with project
development; and 2) preparing two CAB members to participate in the review of relevant pilot grant applications.
CEC will work with community partners to disseminate CEED science. Expanded initiatives in implementation
science will identify novel strategies to enhance translation of CEED science to evidence-based, multi-level
interventions that reduce exposures and health risks. Progress towards the CEC’s goal to translate CEED
science to action and impact will be evaluated by regular benchmarking and soliciting feedback from partners."
10838764,"Improved understanding of the HIV reservoir in tissues is critical to curative efforts. Progress in
understanding the HIV reservoir has been hampered by difficulty to access clinically relevant tissue
samples for HIV cure research. We have overcome this challenge through innovative cohort design and a
long-standing collaboration at the heart of the global HIV epidemic in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. There
we have established the FRESH (Females Rising through Education, Support and Health) Study that allow
us to access large blood volumes and tissue samples from persons who initiate therapy very early in Fiebig
Stage I-II, some of whom have interrupted therapy during their participation in a bNAB intervention study.
We propose to use samples from these cohorts to determine the barriers to HIV eradication in lymph nodes
and the gut, and to test novel approaches of overcoming these barriers using the lymph-node-on-a-chip
technology. This grant builds on the firm foundation laid by compelling data generated in the previous
funding period, including the discovery that HIV persists in germinal center T follicular helper cells (GC
TFH) mainly within the B cell follicles (BCFs) even after more than 3 years. We also showed that a stronger
virus specific CD8+ T cell response in LNs is associated with reduced persistence, however, the lack of
cytolytic potential by CD8+ T cells that infiltrate the BCF allows the virus to persist. We will now use the
best-in-class imaging and omics technologies to determine the molecular barriers to HIV eradication in the
BCFs, testing the hypothesis that HIV induced immune regulatory environment in the BCL mitigates
cytotoxic activity of follicular CD8+ T cells. We will use serial excisional LN, gut biopsies and match
blood samples to identify cellular and signaling processes that impede immune mediated eradication of
HIV in tissues. Additionally, we will create the first known model of the HIV infected human BCF in
vitro using the organ on a chip microfluidics technology and use it to test the impact of IL-15 and IL-10
blockade on enhance CTL mediated eradication of the HIV reservoir the BCF. If successful, these studies
will lead to the discovery of novel therapies for HIV eradication in secondary lymphoid organs which must
be a critical component of an HIV cure strategy."
10838861,"Project Summary
Mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry have become essential tools in virtually all of the molecular
sciences associated with biomedical research. Many questions of interest can be addressed by breaking
macromolecules of interest (e.g., proteins) into smaller fragments prior to analysis. However, information
inherently present in intact macromolecules and their complexes is lost upon digestion, which has motivated the
development of so-called “top-down proteomics” and “native mass spectrometry”. While major advances have
been made in both of these areas, significant challenges remain, particularly for high mass heterogenous
mixtures. This effort emphasizes novel ion chemistries and novel instrumentation directed to challenges in top-
down tandem mass spectrometry of biopolymers and their complexes. Particular emphasis is placed on the
attachment of multiply-charged ions to high-mass analyte ions of opposite polarity to facilitate mass
measurement, mixture analysis, and structural characterization. The controlled attachment of reagents of known
mass and charge can dramatically improve the ‘peak capacity’ of a mass spectrometry measurement applied to
complex mixtures of ions derived from electrospray ionization. Furthermore, ion attachment, in conjunction with
MSn workflows, may prove to be useful in revealing the surface exposure of components in a complex. Novel
ion/ion reactions involving superacid anions may also prove to be useful as gas-phase means for the selective
removal of metal ions that become incorporated in bio-complexes ionized under native conditions. This effort
also involves instrument development aimed at supporting high mass-to-charge ion manipulation (e.g., digital
ion trap operation for ion isolation and ion parking of high mass-to-charge ions) and measurement (digital ion
trap operation and electrostatic ion trap mass analysis) to support multiply-charged ion attachment experiments.
The effort will extend the utility of mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry in top-down biopolymer
characterization as well as in the mass measurement and characterization of large complexes, such as molecular
machines and viruses."
10854406,"Project Summary
This study seeks to understand early health effects in those exposed to toxins following the Feb. 3, 2023 East
Palestine, Ohio (EP) train derailment and subsequent (Feb. 6) controlled burn of toxins. It seeks to assemble a
cohort for longitudinal follow-up, securing survey information on exposures, symptoms and health effects and
in-depth information on relevant covariates to adequately incorporate potential confounders and effect
modifiers. It seeks to assess laboratory tests in a subset, tests previously reported to be affected by EP-
relevant toxins. It separately secures phlebotomy samples for archiving as a resource to benefit future
investigations. Additionally, it seeks to initiate longitudinal follow-up of symptoms/health outcomes. It then
seeks to assess how outcomes relate to EP exposures and to effect modifiers, to identify vulnerabilities and
protections.
We bring to bear our critical expertise from our longstanding work on chronic health consequences of mixed
toxin exposures in Gulf War illness (GWI). We hypothesize that, beyond possible specific effects of EP toxins,
shared mitochondrial toxicity mechanisms that transcend specific chemical class will lead to shared health
consequences. Our early EP findings already support this – with evidence of GWI-like multisymptom illness
and emergence of burn pit-compatible respiratory conditions. Proposed shared mechanisms also have
implications for factors that may mitigate development and severity of health problems. Some such factors can
be assessed as effect modifiers in analysis. It is our work that documented mitochondrial foundations for GWI
– and also affirmed randomized trial benefit of treatment (CoQ10) addressing this. Indeed, a critical benefit of
the study is a focus on vulnerable subgroups – which may be strongly affected even when an overall
population is not – and protective factors that may guide development of preventions and treatment.
Significant progress has already been made in the early stages of this project. A prerecruitment survey has
been conducted, identifying scores of EP residents who have expressed their interest in participating.
Furthermore, interviews with affected EP residents have been carried out, enabling the development of a
comprehensive survey instrument. Importantly, the study has received approval from the UCSD IRB. Moreover,
the acquisition of a $15K start-up award from the UCSD Academic Senate has allowed for project pilot testing,
troubleshooting, and refinement in advance. These proactive actions not only enhance cost efficiency but also
bolsters the project's prospects for success. If granted NIH funding, the study will be poised for a ""full speed
ahead"" launch, building on the foundation established during the jumpstart phase."
10862422,"CORE B - SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lymph nodes (LNs) play a pivotal role in regulating alloimmune responses. The overall goals of this core are (i)
to develop innovative nanodelivery strategies to reprogram the stroma of aged LNs and (ii) to carry out advanced
immune imaging for the homing of aged immune cells to the LNs and their interactions within the LNs. Targeted
delivery of therapeutics to the LN and reprogramming of its stroma would not only inhibit the priming of
alloreactive T cells, but also antagonize memory T cells. Central memory T cells require less stringent activation
stimuli to generate vigorous immune responses. Since memory T cells represent the main barriers to tolerance
induction, therapeutic strategies that specifically target memory T cells address a high unmet need in heart
transplantation. On the other hand, LNs become the primary sites of Treg formation when tolerogenic therapies
are used. The main goal of Core B is to establish a method of targeted delivery of immune therapeutics to the
LN to facilitate transplant tolerance by reprogramming the LN stroma. Core B will be responsible for the
nanoformulation of immune therapeutics proposed in these projects. Core B will also fully characterize these
nanoproducts regarding important parameters such as size, shape, charge, stability and release kinetics.
Nanomedicine has great potential for developing site-specific targeted delivery of therapeutics. We are using a
well-defined, specific delivery strategy that targets glycoprotein molecules known as peripheral node addressin
(PNAd), expressed by very specialized veins present exclusively in the LNs, referred to as high endothelial
venules (HEVs). Core B will be generating nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated with various payloads and coated
with MECA-79 mAb, which recognizes PNAd molecules on HEVs. The overall hypothesis of Core B is that
targeted delivery of immune therapeutics to LNs via HEVs permits specific deposition of payloads to the LNs,
with the ultimate goals of suppressing alloreactive T cells and promoting graft acceptance. On the other hand,
advanced immune imaging of LNs can provide unparalleled information on the trafficking properties of aged
immune cells across aged HEVs. These studies can also comprehensively assess their live interactions within
the aged LNs. In addition, these advanced imaging studies of LNs can provide novel information on the impact
of therapeutics used in this project on immune cell homing and their interactions within the LNs. Therefore, Core
B will have two aims: (i) targeted nanodelivery of therapeutics to aged LNs and (ii) advanced live immune imaging
of LNs for immune cell and NP trafficking."
10862774,"Project Summary/Abstract
Current and future Center for Prevention Research (CPR) investigators will be engaged in epidemiological and
modeling research to better understand patterns and rural factors associated with children's health risk. In a
complementary fashion, developing solutions for these rural health risks will require a richer understanding of
potential intervention pathways and strategies. Child health focused interventions that function in rural settings
will be a key feature of CPR researchers' next step, but such endeavors will require a mixed methods
approach that extends beyond evaluation of existing data. To meet these needs, the Stakeholder Engagement
and Intervention Support (SEIS) Core has been designed with the overall objective of providing CPR
researchers with support to inform thoughtful and testable intervention strategies. In this way the SEIS Core
provides key transitional support as Center investigators pursue R01 funding in the next phase of their
research careers. We will accomplish our overall objective through four Specific Aims. Through Aim 1, we will
establish the SEIS Core, providing CPR investigators support in stakeholder engagement and intervention
design. Intervention support will be provided through primary data collection (Aim 2) and health economics
analyses (Aim 3). Finally, through Aim 4 (stakeholder engagement) we will support CPR investigators in
engagement with regional stakeholders. Following these four aims, the SEIS Core will ensure that CPR
research projects and CPR investigators have the technical and partnership support they need as they pursue
independent research funding in the next step of their research careers and strive to improve children's health
in our rural region."
10862831,"ABSTRACT – CELL IMAGING AND HISTOLOGY SHARED RESOURCE
The mission of the Cell Imaging and Histology Shared Resource, which is managed by the Cancer Center, is to
provide state-of-the-art imaging and histological services to Center researchers. The Core offers the
instrumentation, expertise, training, and service to enable advanced cellular imaging and data analysis. The Cell
Imaging facility's technology includes a recently acquired hybrid confocal/super-resolution Nikon A1 microscope
system equipped for live-cell imaging, as well as three other confocal microscope systems—a Zeiss LSM 710
NLO laser point scanning system equipped with a multiphoton laser, An Olympus FloView 1000, and a Yokogawa
spinning disk confocal microscope. In addition, the facility has six other fluorescence microscopes supporting a
wide range of imaging technologies such as FRET, TIRF, live cell and time-lapse imaging. Most of the advanced
microscopes at SBP are located within the facility. The facility's computer workstations provide access to image
analysis software packages including Image-Pro plus, MetaMorph, Volocity, and Imaris 8.0, as well as Nikon
software for off-line reconstruction of Nikon Super-Resolution data. The Histology facility services include
preparation and cryosectioning of tissues; automated staining for H&E (Leica XLf), and immunohistochemistry,
immunofluorescence, and in situ hybridization (Leica Bond RX). The facility's Aperio slide scanners (AT2 and FL
ScanScopes, Leica) provide automated high-resolution scanning of whole IHC or fluorescence stained slides for
data documentation, analysis, storage, and dissemination. The facility also provides assistance in obtaining
human tissues, including assistance with IRB and MTA issues. Both the adjacent Cell Imaging and Histology
facilities provide user training or full-service. Trained microscope users have 24/7 access to the equipment, with
reservations for each instrument made through an on-line iLab calendar. The Core is very broadly used—in the
past 5 years, the Core has contributed to research in 47 Cancer Center member laboratories representing all
three Center programs and assisted in projects resulting in more than 190 cancer-relevant publications."
10862833,"ABSTRACT – STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY SHARED RESOURCE
The mission of the Structural Biology Shared Resource is to advance our understanding of the molecular basis
of cancer by giving Cancer Center scientists access to equipment, technology and expertise for structural and
biophysical studies of biological molecules. Structural biology enables multi-scale visualization of molecular and
supramolecular structure and dynamics with the ultimate goal of characterizing biological systems in their
functional native states. This requires a multidisciplinary approach that spans the ranges of length and time
scales effective in biology. The Core, managed by the Center, maintains state-of-the-art equipment, develops
technology, provides service, and promotes collaborative activities with Cancer Center scientists. There are four
central and complementary areas of structural biology: nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray
crystallography, the recently added electron cryo-microscopy and cellular tomography (cryo-EM, and ET), and
the long-standing biomolecular analysis facility. These technologies are typically not available in individual
Center member laboratories, owing to their expense and complexity of operation. Core equipment supporting
NMR includes two 600 MHz instruments with cryoprobes, a wide bore 500 MHz spectrometer set up for solid
state analysis, and a highly automated 400 MHz instrument supporting chemistry. X-ray crystallography
equipment includes a robotic dispenser and two, automated imaging incubators (5° and 20°), a Rigaku FRE
SuperBright X-ray diffractometer with two independent beams and detectors. Cryo-EM analysis is supported by
a Thermo Titan Krios with a 4Kx4K Falcon III direct electron detection device and a phase plate, as well as a
Tecnai 12 Spirit G2 equipped with a 4Kx4K CCD. Finally, equipment supporting biomolecular analysis includes
an analytical ultracentrifuge, DSC, UV/vis spectrometry, Fluorescence spectrophotometer, two ITC instruments,
and MST. The three Ph.D.-level Core staff maintain the equipment, train users, and in the case of biomolecular
analysis, provide full-service analysis. For structural biology analysis, Core users can collaborate with Core staff
for smaller projects or collaborate with expert structural biology groups in the Cancer Center to pursue more
complex projects. A number of such successful collaborations are described in the Research Plan. In the past 5
years, the Core was used by 16 Center labs representing all three programs, and supported 62 cancer-related
publications."
10862837,"ABSTRACT – CHEMICAL LIBRARY SCREENING SHARED RESOURCE
The Chemical Library Screening (CLS) Shared Resource is managed by the Cancer Center. This resource offers
Center scientists the ability to develop and conduct small- and large-scale chemical library screens and perform
hit optimization and validation for generating selective probes/leads modulating biochemical and cellular
processes in cancer. In addition, CLS provides faculty with access to technology, expertise, and infrastructure
resources to develop novel assays for characterizing cellular targets involved in tumor initiation and pathogenesis
and to advance the development of new lead molecules for anti-tumor therapies. CLS consists of four specialized
but highly integrated facilities: High-Throughput Assay Development (HT-AD), Compound Management and
High-Throughput Screening (CM-HTS), High-Content Screening (HCS), and Medicinal Chemistry and Drug
Metabolism/Pharmacokinetics (MedChem/DMPK). The facilities physically reside within the Conrad Prebys
Center for Chemical Genomics (Prebys Center) at SBP, which occupies more than 12,000 sq. ft. of laboratory
space and houses substantial HTS and HCS assay development and screening instrumentation capabilities.
CLS has access to a broad spectrum of diverse and focused small-molecule collections, several integrated liquid
handling systems, and a plethora of detection instruments, capable of performing assays in any mode, including
live-cell image-based assays requiring temperature and CO2 control. The Prebys Center grew out of the Cancer
Center's CLS Shared Resource, which was initiated in the 2003 CCSG renewal. This support has been leveraged
with several large grant awards and philanthropic funds. Initially awarded a grant as one of ten NIH Molecular
Libraries Screening Network Comprehensive Centers, the Prebys Center was later selected as one of four NIH-
designated Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network comprehensive screening centers. It is also
one of seven dedicated Centers for the NCI Chemical Biology Consortium (CBC). Despite the growth of the
Prebys Center, the CLS Core remains of crucial importance to Center investigators because it provides an
important interactive entry point to ensure that they derive the maximum scientific benefit from these world class
chemical biology and drug discovery capabilities, enabling both fundamental and translational scientific
endeavors. In the past 5 years, the Core has additionally enabled >100 assay development projects for Cancer
Center investigators, resulting in >25 full HTS campaigns to support the goal of early translation. It has provided
services for 36 Center investigators representing all three programs. The data generated have supported 24
successful grants from 16 Center members and numerous publications, including 20 publications co-authored
by CLS staff."
10862862,"Project Summary—Didactic Interactions 
 There is a critical need to provide educational activities to assist researchers and clinicians in the 
consistent and meaningful use of the vast array of technologies that are currently available to assess patient 
performance. Scientists and clinicians at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab and Northwestern University have 
extensive experience successfully using sensors, mobile apps, and other devices with their patients in the 
clinic, home, and community. Our highly collaborative scientists and clinicians will share their knowledge, 
experience, and technical and clinical know-how to provide training and enhance expertise across the field of 
rehabilitation research and practice. 
 Educational programs for the Center for Smart use of Technologies to Assess Real-world Outcomes (C- 
STAR) will be designed and organized by our scientific and clinical experts who will ensure that a broad range 
of topics relevant to C-STAR are suitable for diverse audiences within the rehabilitation field, and do not 
overlap with existing materials or educational offerings. Specifically, we aim to: (1) Develop a broad range of 
educational activities for research and clinical professionals within rehabilitation and related fields who are 
using (or plan to use) technology to measure patient performance; (2) Customize content to our target 
audience by providing these educational activities through a variety of mechanisms including onsite at Shirley 
Ryan AbilityLab, at professional meetings, and through live and archived distance or online learning methods; 
(3) Build an online repository of learning materials that is accessible to the research community, thereby 
increasing our reach in a cost-effective manner. Some examples of programming will include in-person 
conferences or courses, accredited continuing education online courses, webinars, podcast series, special 
sessions at national professional conferences (such as the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine or 
IEEE-sponsored conferences), and free seats to Academy continuing education programs. 
 To achieve these aims, we will leverage the resources of the Academy—the not-for-profit educational arm 
of the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. The Academy is one of the largest centers for continuing rehabilitation 
education in the world, offering more than 80 on-demand webinars on a wide-range of rehabilitation topics 
including brain injury, stroke, and spinal cord injury. In order to ensure that the needs of the C-STAR 
community are being addressed and to identify new areas in which additional educational activities could be 
developed, we will regularly conduct needs assessments and collect feedback from our learners."
10862863,"Project Summary—Mentored Collaborative Opportunities 
Mentored collaborative opportunities provided by C-STAR include sabbaticals and pilot grant awards. The 
Specific Aims of this Center's mentored collaborative opportunities component are to: (1) Match junior 
rehabilitation researchers with senior scientists at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab (SRAlab) for sabbaticals; (2) Develop 
the mentoring skills of senior scientists to assure successful collaborative opportunities; and (3) Develop plans 
with home institutions of visiting researchers to share responsibility for candidates' visits. Achieving these aims 
will allow us to promote, support, and prioritize interactions between visiting researchers and C-STAR 
investigators. We will develop agreements with the home institutions of visiting researchers that specify plans to 
share responsibility for financial support of candidates' visits. In addition, we will draw on the mentor training 
expertise of Northwestern University's Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. 
 The Research Plan for mentored collaborative opportunities draws on scientist-mentors at laboratories to 
support visiting rehabilitation researchers conducting pilot projects. A critical resource is the translational 
research model of the SRAlab. Five unique Ability Labs™ focus on distinct aspects of human performance. 
Within these Labs, 37 principal investigators collaborate with 71 physicians and 361 therapists as well as 
investigators at numerous academic institutions across the United States. Several centers, including the 
Regenstein Center for Bionic Medicine, the Center for Rehabilitation Outcomes Research, and the Center for 
Aphasia Research and Treatment, have extensive experience mentoring early-career and junior investigators. 
 In developing this application, we considered critical issues such as the structure of mentoring relationships 
and incentives to assure that they are sustained. We have budgeted two 0.5 FTE personnel for implementation 
and outcomes per year for mentored collaborative activities. All SRAlab senior scientists will contribute 5% effort 
to the P2C per year, which will be funded by SRAlab. This effort will include mentoring of C-STAR clients. We 
will provide an honorarium for scientists from Northwestern University as compensation for their mentorship. We 
will negotiate the logistics of on-site mentored collaborations with visiting researchers' home institutions and the 
home institution's financial support of visiting researchers. We anticipate a 1:4 cost sharing arrangement with 
host institutions covering 80% of visiting scientists' expenses, with exceptions for institutions serving historically 
disadvantaged populations; we will provide up to $50K to support sabbaticals for individuals from such 
institutions. We will make substantive and sustained efforts to recruit scientists from minority backgrounds, 
including those located at historically black colleges and universities and from Native American and Hispanic 
backgrounds, as well as trainees with disabilities. Applications from visiting researchers will include a career 
development plan that specifies the skills they wish to develop, their planned research project, and formal plans 
for promoting, supporting, and prioritizing on-site interactions."
10862865,"Project Summary—Technology Development 
 Based on the collective experiences of the clinicians, scientists, engineers, and patient collaborators who 
comprise the Center for Smart use of Technologies to Assess Real-world Outcomes (C-STAR), we propose 
three specific aims with the primary goals of: (1) addressing the need for laboratory, clinical, and community 
assessment, (2) providing a resource for the rehabilitation research community, (3) extending technologies for 
which we have significant preliminary data, and (4) providing resources for use C-STAR clients during Pilot 
Studies, sabbaticals, or other sponsored collaborative activities. 
 We have previously developed and tested a new class of epidermal electronic sensor (EES)-based 
technologies that has tremendous potential to track real-world outcomes for rehabilitation researchers. EES- 
based technologies package conventional inorganic semiconductor technologies into thin, lightweight, 
mechanically `soft' (i.e., flexible, stretchable) devices that provide advanced, wireless biosensing capabilities. 
Epifluidic devices integrate electronic components with microfluidic sweat collection systems to enable non- 
invasive, continuous monitoring of sweat dynamics (loss, instantaneous rate, and average rate), biochemical 
composition, and physiology, skin health, and hydration. For Aim 1, we will add the capacity for real-time 
measurement of cortisol levels in sweat to this sensor. 
 Many technologies, such as smart watches or mobile phones, generally have many capabilities and are easy 
to use. Although the raw data measured with such technologies (accelerations, angular velocities, barometric 
readings, etc.) are of high quality, the algorithms used to interpret these data do not translate well for individuals 
with disability. It is critical to calibrate mobility prediction algorithms using properly labelled, condition-specific 
data collected from individuals with disability. For Aim 2, we will convene expert panels of clinicians, scientists, 
and users to create standardized protocols for collecting labelled “benchmark” sensor data specific to stroke 
survivors, persons with spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, or Parkinson's disease. We will then collect 
labelled activity data from mobile phones, smart watches, and inertial sensors from cohorts of individuals with 
these conditions to generate a publicly available, online database. 
 The Rehabilitation Measures Database (RMD) is a leading resource for benchmarks and outcomes, featuring 
more than 400 measures supported by doctors, clinicians, therapists, and rehabilitation researchers and 
achieving an average of 11,000 hits per day. While the site works well for laptop and desktop computers, 
improvements would allow access to RMD in the field using smart phones and tablets. For Aim 3, we will develop 
a RMD application (app) with an intuitive user interface that can be used with Android and iOS operating systems. 
 These aims build on our current technologies to generate resources that will be of immense value to the 
rehabilitation research community."
10862867,"Project Summary—Pilot Studies 
Providing critical pilot funding to support state-of-the-art, clinically relevant studies by junior researchers across 
the country is an essential service of our “Center for use of Smart Technologies to Assess Real-world 
Performance (C-STAR) Medical Rehabilitation Resource program. We will use several methods to reach 
members of our target populations (primarily junior rehabilitation researchers and clinicians) across the country: 
(i) our C-STAR website, (ii) our Rehabilitation Measures Database—which attracts an average of about 11,000 
daily hits from precisely the individuals who may be candidates for pilot funding, and (iii) through professional 
interactions—our PIs, Core Directors and key personnel will reach out to potential applicants during the many 
relevant meetings they attend nationwide. We will take steps to ensure that our outreach targets individuals from 
underrepresented populations in rehabilitation research through targeted outreach to historically black colleges 
and universities and to offices of minority affairs at other universities. Application for C-STAR pilot funding will 
be a two-stage process. First, we will require a simple Letter of Intent (LOI) that includes the project title, a half- 
page description of the specific aims, an NIH-style biosketch for the investigator and key personnel, and a cover 
page that asks for information that will allow us to select a review panel with appropriate expertise (i.e., 
engineering, outcomes, clinical, implementation and community engagement), based on the goals of the project, 
subject population, and domain of the research (in-lab, in-clinic, or real-world assessments, or two or more 
intersecting domains). If the LOI is selected, we will require a full application, one month later, that will consist 
of an additional 3-page summary of the approach, a budget, and a letter of support from the home institution. 
The LOI and full application will be submitted through our C-STAR portal and managed through NITRO- 
competitions software, developed by Northwestern University Clinical and Translation Sciences Institute. 
Applications will be objectively evaluated by Center Core Directors and relevant key personnel; Leora Cherney, 
PhD, Pilot Studies Director, will convene the review panel and oversee the review process. We anticipate a wide 
variety of funded studies, in terms of the study type, patient population under study, and the technologies 
employed. We will solicit applications twice a year and award 6 pilot projects per year, each with a total direct 
cost of up to $25,000. In addition, full institutional indirect costs will be provided to ensure pilot funding is used 
for research. All applicants will receive extensive feedback on their projects and mentorship from C-STAR faculty 
as desired or needed. Applicants who are funded may choose whether to conduct their research at their home 
institution or at SRAlab. Applicants will have access to our four cores: Engineering, Clinical, Outcomes, and 
Implementation Science & Community Engagement. We will prioritize projects that (i) support junior researchers 
with intriguing ideas, in particular, those from underrepresented groups, (ii) have the potential to advance 
rehabilitation research and benefit patients, and (iii) will lead to extramural funding and career advancement."
10862868,"Project Summary—Promoting Center Expertise 
Creating awareness of and engagement with the Center for Smart use of Technologies for Assessment of Real- 
world Outcomes (C-STAR) will be an essential undertaking to ensure Center success. The challenge is 
augmented by the need to connect to a small (< 5,000) and diverse target audience of basic and clinical 
researchers stretching across multiple scientific, technical, and diagnostic domains. Additionally, continued 
engagement with the target audience will be necessary to promote, disseminate, and amplify C-STAR outcomes. 
To achieve our goal, we propose two specific aims: (1) To create awareness and consideration such that our 
target audiences will want to “Connect” and begin active engagement with C-STAR. (2) To “Share” (e.g., 
disseminate) outcomes from C-STAR as well as provide access to research resources. We intend to achieve 
these aims through a variety of methods—all market tested for efficiency and effectiveness over several years 
by the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab marketing team. We will achieve Aim 1 by tapping into a diverse set of marketing 
channels to ensure maximal reach and impact with our targets. It is critical that we not over-rely on any one 
strategy but instead recognize that our target audiences engage across many marketing channels and thus we 
must seek them out in those channels. Additionally, multiple exposures to our messaging in different formats will 
help break through ambient clutter to drive awareness and consideration of C-STAR. Accordingly, our primary 
marketing vehicles for Aim 1 will include such tactics as: cross-promoting C-STAR on our proprietary 
Rehabilitation Measures Database website, conference exhibits, targeted advertising on social media, monthly 
emails to prospects and those who are already engaged, and advertising through associations and universities. 
To achieve Aim 2, we will utilize many of the strategies and tactics summarized above. In addition, we will build 
and promote C-STAR's web portal—which will be designed to house outcomes from pilot studies, collaborations, 
data sets, research manuals and reference articles—and plan and promote annual symposia that focused on 
latest findings and outcomes."
10823543,"Abstract
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness in developed countries. Breakdown of the
blood retinal barrier (BRB) in DR leads to macular edema and is one of the earliest events during the
development of disease. The blood retinal barrier is comprised of inner and outer components: the outer barrier
is formed by tight junctions between the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, and the inner barrier is formed by
tight junctions between the retinal vascular endothelial cells. While the inner blood retinal barrier has been well
studied, the development and regulation of the outer blood retinal barrier has not been carefully examined in the
context of DR. Tight junction protein, Claudin-19, is the predominant claudin in the RPE, and has been shown to
play a role in the barrier properties of the RPE. Additionally, previous work from our laboratory suggest that
hyperinsulinemia (as seen in type 2 diabetes) may lead to disruption of the outer BRB. The purpose of this study
is to identify the spatial localization and functions of claudins in the RPE and test the hypothesis that regulation
of RPE claudins with hyperglycemia/hyperinsulinemia leads to breakdown of the blood retinal barrier.
Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in breakdown of the outer blood retinal barrier will help
identify therapeutic targets for macular edema in diabetic retinopathy."

Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are antibodies that react against self-antigens and are commonly used to help
diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Because the test is positive (ANA+) in almost every patient
with SLE— even years before the disease onset—a positive ANA test is considered virtually a requisite for the
diagnosis of SLE. However, the test is also positive in a large proportion of the general population (~20%).
Although very few of these ANA+ individuals will develop an autoimmune disease in the future, the clinical
impact of a positive ANA in people without autoimmune disease is unknown. A second problem is that the
common occurrence of ANA+ in people without autoimmune disease can lead to the problem of an incorrect
diagnosis of SLE, particularly if an ANA+ person also has joint or muscle pain. To more accurately diagnose
SLE and prevent false diagnoses, we need to address two major knowledge gaps: 1) we need to understand
the importance of a positive ANA test in people without an autoimmune disease; and 2) we need to be able to
predict which people with a positive ANA test have or will develop SLE.
In this study we will evaluate the overarching hypothesis that clinical and genetic information can: 1)
define the clinical consequences of positive ANA in people without autoimmune diseases, and 2)
improve risk prediction to differentiate people with increased risk of SLE. Thus, we proposed three
Specific Aims: 1) test the hypothesis that a positive ANA in people without autoimmune disease is associated
with clinical phenotypes (using a clinical and a genetic approach); 2) test the hypothesis that a clinical
prediction model will accurately discriminate patients with early SLE or who are at risk for SLE from among
those with positive ANA without an autoimmune disease; and 3) test the hypothesis that the combination of
genetic and clinical information will accurately discriminate patients at risk for SLE. To address these aims, we
will use the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Biobank (BioVU) and de-identified electronic health records
(EHR) to create genetic and clinical risk scores using state-of-the-art genetic techniques and data-driven
prediction tools.
The results of these studies could: a) define whether people with a positive ANA and no autoimmune disease
have an altered risk of illnesses that could be used to guide health-care decisions; and b) transform the care of
SLE by improving the accuracy of early-stage SLE diagnosis and identify patients at highest future risk. These
findings will help clinicians start treatment earlier to control inflammation and prevent damage and will
decrease the rates of misdiagnosis, thereby protecting patients from unnecessary therapies and their side
effects."
10827937,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Progression through the cell cycle involves spatiotemporal coordination of cytoskeletal and membrane
dynamics with controlled proteolysis events. The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is the main
E3 ubiquitin ligase regulating mitosis. Whereas the temporal control of APC/C-mediated ubiquitination is well
established, the spatial organization of APC/C function is a key uncharacterized dimension to its activity, access
to substrates, and effects on mitosis. We have identified a novel link between phosphoinositides (PIPs), which
form a lipid-based code of membrane identity, the microtubule cytoskeleton, and the APC/C that is mediated by
PLEKHA5, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing, PIP-binding protein. We discovered PLEKHA5 as a
microtubule- and plasma membrane-localized protein interactor of the APC/C whose depletion by siRNA
antagonizes mitotic progression, causing a buildup of APC/C substrates. We propose that PLEKHA5 regulates
APC/C subcellular localization and thus controls access to key mitotic substrates. Yet, it is unknown which
aspects of PLEKHA5’s molecular properties are required for its cell cycle functions. As well, the localization of
the APC/C at different stages of the cell cycle still remains largely a mystery, as is the effect of PLEKHA5 on
APC/C localization and function. Further, the role of PLEKHA5 in modulating the composition and E3 ligase
activity of the APC/C is unknown. Our long-term research goal is to understand how PIP-sensing proteins read
the dynamically changing lipid composition of membranes and transduce this information to regulate the
localization and function of important proteins in cell signaling. The objective of this proposal is to understand
the molecular events through which PLEKHA5 controls the localization and activity of the APC/C and thus
regulates cell cycle progression. The central hypothesis guiding this work is that PLEKHA5 engages the plasma
membrane and the microtubule cytoskeleton in a spatiotemporally controlled fashion and recruits the APC/C to
these locations to access substrates whose ubiquitination is critical for progression through mitosis. In this
proposal, we will first establish molecular mechanisms governing PLEKHA5 regulation of mitotic entry and
progression by testing the hypothesis that PLEKHA5 localization and interactions with APC/C are important for
its effects on mitosis. In addition, we will determine subcellular localizations of APC/C and the role of PLEKHA5
in controlling APC/C localization and function by developing and applying a suite of “in vivo biochemistry” tools
to assess the localization of APC/C, evaluate its colocalization with PLEKHA5, elucidate the effects of PLEKHA5
depletion on APC/C localization, and ascertain how ectopic localization of PLEKHA5 affects its cell cycle
functions. Finally, we will determine the direct effects of PLEKHA5 on the composition and in vitro E3 ubiquitin
ligase activity of the APC/C. Our studies will establish a new mechanistic framework for understanding how
spatial organization of the ubiquitination machinery affects cellular pathways important for health and disease."

This application seeks to innovatively model the dynamic course of PTSD symptoms (PTSS), alcohol use
disorder (AUD), and interpersonal conflict in a sample of 250 OIF/OEF/OND veterans and test hypotheses
regarding combined effects of regulatory deficits, sleep disturbance, and the role of implicit approach /
avoidance biases. Participants will be randomized to a cognitive bias modification (CBM) training condition in a
2 (Alcohol CBM, Control) x 2 (PTSD CBM, Control) design. The longitudinal burst design will result in a high
fidelity dataset of near real-time assessments of AUD, PTSS, interpersonal conflict, and deficits in affect and
behavior regulation over the course of 2 years. Sleep disturbance will be assessed by actigraphy. The
application addresses three related questions. First, what processes link (PTSS), AUD symptoms, and
interpersonal conflict at the within-person (i.e., daily) level? We propose that acute changes (e.g., day-to-day)
in emotional and behavioral dysregulation are two pathways linking PTSS, AUD symptoms, and interpersonal
conflict at the within-persons level. Second, what contributes to reciprocal associations between PTSS and
AUD outcomes? Alcohol use has well-documented negative effects on sleep quality. Sleep disturbance is a
common symptom of PTSD and impairs emotional and behavior regulation. Sleep disturbance may explain
observed bi-directional associations. Third, why do state changes in emotional arousal and disinhibition
increase symptoms of AUD reflecting impaired control over alcohol intake? Implicit response biases are
conceptualized as a latent risk factor that influences behavior most strongly when self-regulation is impaired.
We propose that heightened emotional arousal and disinhibition associated with acute (i.e., daily) PTSS
exacerbation result in an increased effect of implicit processes on behavior. Hence, effects of implicit biases on
behavior vary across time and context. Heavy drinkers exhibit approach biases for alcohol and sexual
trauma victims exhibit avoidance biases toward trauma cues, which are related to PTSD severity. The
experimental manipulation of implicit biases paired with the longitudinal burst design follow-up will test whether
implicit response biases are related to PTSS and outcomes over time. We hypothesize that manipulating
maladaptive response biases will reduce within-person associations between PTSS, affect and behavioral
dysregulation, sleep disturbance, and the alcohol-related outcomes. The scientific premise of the application is
bolstered by a well-informed and balanced review of the empirical literature and excellent pilot data supporting
the hypotheses. The experimental design, multi-site sample, experience sampling protocol, and sophisticated
data analytic strategy contribute to a highly rigorous test of the hypotheses. The proposed project integrates
the study of implicit cognition, sleep disturbance, affect dysregulation, and behavioral disinhibition to advance
understanding of functional associations between traumatic stress, AUD, and interpersonal conflict. This study
will have high impact on the field’s understanding of mechanisms underlying PTSD and AUD comorbidity."
10861757,"Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) affects at least 10,000 people each year in the U.S., and is particularly prevalent in the aging population. MDS is a clonal disorder arising in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), characterized by impaired myeloid and erythroid differentiation and genomic instability. There are currently few therapeutic approaches available to improve cytopenias in MDS patients. Mutations in RNA splicing factors are
observed in 50% of MDS cases, and are important contributors to MDS initiation and progression. Most hematopoietic growth factors and cytokines signal through the PI3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. We have found that compound deletion of the three PI3K isoforms P110a, b, and d in mouse hematopoietic cells leads to a phenotype resembling MDS, with cytopenias, impaired HSC differentiation and genomic instability. Interestingly, we observed enrichment of our TKO HSC expression signature in an MDS patient gene expression dataset. Furthermore, a subset of MDS samples have elevated expression levels of the negative regulator PTEN, suggesting functional inactivation of PI3K in these MDS patients. Our preliminary data reveals that HSCs in PI3K triple knockout (TKO) mice have a defect in autophagy, an intracellular recycling mechanism that is important for the maintenance of HSC differentiation. We found that pharmacologic induction of autophagy can improve differentiation of TKO HSCs. We also observed widespread alterations in mRNA splicing in TKO HSCs. Therefore, PI3K TKO mice are a valuable new model system to study the mechanisms of MDS initiation and progression. We hypothesize that maintenance of PI3K signaling in HSCs is
required to maintain HSC differentiation and to protect HSCs from DNA damage. We propose to (1) determine whether induction of autophagy can improve myeloid and erythroid differentiation in MDS patient samples, (2) delineate the mechanism by which PI3K and its downstream kinase AKT control mRNA splicing in HSCs and in MDS, and (3) determine whether MDS cells with splicing factor mutations are more sensitive to inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling. These approaches will further our understanding of how growth factor and cytokine signaling regulates autophagy and mRNA splicing through PI3K/AKT in MDS initiation. We also plan to test several therapeutic approaches to improve differentiation in MDS, including induction of autophagy and inhibition of PI3K/AKT in MDS with splicing factor mutations."
10861758,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Invasive cervical cancer (ICC) kills nearly 311,000 women each year worldwide with an estimated 50%
increase in deaths by 2040. In the U.S., ICC ranks third for average years of life lost and
disproportionately affects minority groups and women of low socioeconomic status. Women with
advanced or recurrent ICC soon develop resistance to current chemotherapy options, and about 90%
die within 2 years. Our intent is to define clinically relevant and targetable ICC genes and pathways to
improve patients’ treatments and outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that HPV integration events—and
the changes they exert on the host genome and epigenome—confer a selective advantage to disease
progression and provide opportunities to pinpoint genes and pathways relevant to treating ICC. Using
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ICC cohort (CESC), we developed a pipeline to identify integration
detected genes (IDGs) altered by HPV integration in some ICCs and by genomic and/or epigenomic
modifications in other ICCs. Elements of our pipeline focus on proximity to the integration site, clonal
representation of the integration event, patient- and disease-specific gene expression, association with
ICC survival, and frequency of alteration in ICC. For this proposal, we will expand our discovery pipeline
to a newly completed multi-omics ICC cohort, the HTMCP (HIV+ Tumor Molecular Characterization
Project), incorporating new technology and testing the functional contribution of IDGs to ICC and
chemoresponse. This in-depth characterization of a plethora of IDGs will help us identify novel
targets/pathways which is a critical step towards better therapy for women with ICC. To this end, we will
pursue the following Specific Aims: Identify and filter IDGs from HPV integration sites in HTMCP
samples using our established pipeline, long-read DNA and cDNA sequencing, and other genomic
studies (Aim 1), determine the functional contribution of IDGs to ICC and their therapeutic targeting
potential using siRNA-mediated KD and/or CRISPR-based gene editing in cervical cancer cell lines and
orthotopic xenograft models, (Aim 2), and determine the clinical relevance and biomarker potential of
IDGs (Aim 3)."

10862013,"PROJECT 1 - ABSTRACT
The rapid development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has helped ease most of the restrictions in place during the
height of the pandemic to limit transmission of the virus. Unfortunately, the adaptive immunity (i.e., antibody and
T cell responses) induced by current vaccines declines rapidly, thus requiring frequent boosts. Most importantly,
current vaccines fail to optimally protect against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). The clinical
manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infections are highly variable, and patients can be asymptomatic or exhibit
symptoms ranging from mild, moderate, or severe conditions that can lead to death. It is estimated that over
30% of SARS-CoV-2 infected people worldwide (~ 65 millions) have developed Post-Acute COVID Syndrome
(PACS), or Long COVID, characterized by pulmonary, mental health, neurological, hematological, diabetes,
gastrointestinal, kidney, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular disorders. Prior infections do not eliminate risks of
PACS, and 10-12% of cases are after breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated individuals
Furthermore, reinfections were recently reported to increase the risks of death, hospitalization and PACS. Thus,
new therapeutic approaches are needed to prevent or better manage acute SARS-CoV-2 infections and PACS.
COVID-19 patients exhibit excessive inflammatory responses and the release of a large amount of pro-
inflammatory cytokines, or cytokine storm which directly correlate with lung injury, multiple organ failure, and an
unfavorable prognosis. We recently observed that human caspase-4 (CASP4), which is a homolog of mouse
CASP11, is significantly upregulated in nasal swabs and lungs of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 disease.
Furthermore, we found that mice lacking CASP11 develop less severe disease after infection with SARS-CoV-2
and we reported that CASP11 mediates lung pathology, inflammation, and thrombosis during SARS-CoV-2
infection. This project aims to elucidate immune check points regulated by CASP11 during mild, severe COVID-
19 and PACS. We will also test whether targeting CASP11 alone of together with factors which regulate viral
replication during severe SARS-CoV-2 could improve/prevent pathologies and enhance/promote protective
adaptive immunity."
10862015,"Project 3: Host and viral RNA modifications and their roles in multi-organ pathologies
Abstract
The continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) and antibody and drug-escaping mutants
complicates the current COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to develop new improved antiviral
therapies for COVID-19. RNA modification is a widespread post-translational modification of RNA that regulates
numerous biological processes including RNA metabolism, protein translation, gene expression, and innate and
adaptive immune responses. Currently, the roles of these RNA modifications and their modifying enzymes in
SARS-CoV-2 replication, innate immunity, and pathogenesis are largely unknown. Project 3 is built upon our
recent finding that inhibition of several major RNA modifying enzymes decreases SARS-CoV-2 replication and
lung pathology in vitro and in vivo and that inhibition of caspase-4/11 (CASP11) blocks the root cause of SARS-
CoV-2-induced cytokine storm and multi-organ pathology (Projects 1 and 2). These data leads to our hypothesis
that inhibition of both RNA modifying enzymes and CASP11 will be an improved therapeutic strategy. The goals
of Project 3 are to determine the roles of major RNA modifications in modulating SARS-CoV-2 replication, innate
immunity, and pathogenesis, to understand the interplay between CASP4/11 and RNA modifying enzymes, and
to develop new improved antiviral therapies by synergistic targeting CASP11 and RNA modifications. In Aim 1,
we will use high-throughput RNA sequencing techniques to precisely map major RNA modifications including
N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C) 2’-O-methylation (Nm), pseudouridine (Ψ), N7-
methylguanosine (m7G), and N1-methyladenosine (m1A) in SARS-CoV-2 and host RNAs purified from COVID-
19 patients and virus-infected ex vivo primary well-differentiated human bronchial epithelial cultures (hBEC) and
we will determine the roles of these RNA modifying enzymes in SARS-CoV-2 replication, innate immune
response, and pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2, we will determine whether inhibition of RNA modifying
enzymes and CASP11 provides synergistic therapeutic effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We will first
determine the interplay between CASP11 and RNA modifications during SARS-CoV-2 infection. CASP11 and
specific RNA modifying enzymes will be knocked out together in hBEC and mice. The impact of double knockouts
on SARS-CoV-2 replication, innate immunity, and pathogenesis will be determined. Finally, we will determine
the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of a panel of small molecule inhibitors or shRNA-nanoparticles targeting RNA
modifying enzymes in vitro and in vivo. The most potent inhibitor will be chosen to combine with the most effective
CASP11 inhibitor, and we will determine whether their combination provides synergistic therapeutic effects
against COVID-19 disease. The successful outcome of Project 3 will not only fill a major gap in our
understanding of the roles of RNA modifications and CASP11 in viral replication, innate immunity, and
pathogenesis but also facilitate the development of novel, improved therapeutic strategies against SARS-
CoV-2 infection by targeting RNA modifications and CASP11."
10856405,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Beta 2 adrenergic receptor (AR) agonists (-agonists) are prominent prophylaxis and rescue medicines in
asthma. However, the therapeutic efficacy of -agonists is limited by multiple clinical problems associated with
the chronic use of -agonists, including tachyphylaxis and worsening asthma symptoms. Therefore, there is a clinical
need to develop strategies to improve the efficacy of β-agonists. At a molecular level, β2AR binds to multiple proteins such
as Gs, -arrestins, G-protein receptor kinase, and protein kinase A, leading to intricate, multidimensional signaling and
functional effects. The canonical β2AR-Gs signaling relaxes airway smooth muscle (ASM), whereas β2AR-arrestin
signaling promotes receptor desensitization, cell proliferation, and mucus production in the airways. Leveraging the
concepts of “Biased agonism” and “Allosteric modulation” in G protein-coupled receptor pharmacology, in this application,
we propose to employ advanced computational approaches and identify novel β2AR conformations and allosteric sites,
and develop ligands that bind to those sites and promote specific (beneficial) signaling and functional effect in airways. Our
studies identified unique -agonist-induced conformations and a novel allosteric site on the β2AR. Database screening
identified small-molecule ligands that can bind to this site and modulate β2AR-Gs signaling and relaxation of human ASM
cells and bronchodilation of human and murine airways. Motivated by these data, we hypothesize that selective
enhancement of the β2AR-Gs signaling by positive allosteric modulators (AMs) of β2AR developed by
computational approaches will provide therapeutic benefits in asthma. In Aim 1, we will employ advanced
computational approaches, including atomistic molecular dynamics simulations at a superior spatial and
temporal resolution in the presence of interacting proteins and different clinically relevant -agonists. Further, we
will develop functional group affinity patterns, FragMaps, for different conformations of β2AR and identify allosteric
binding sites and screen for ligands binding to those sites. These studies will also establish the structural basis
for the modulation of specific signaling of β2AR by the AMs. Aim 2 studies will elucidate the signaling (Gs: Gs
activation, cyclic AMP generation, protein kinase A activation; -arrestin: arrestin recruitment, phosphorylation of
p42/p44, loss of cell surface expression of β2AR) mechanisms and functional effects (ASM relaxation,
bronchodilation, ASM cell proliferation, and mucus/cytokine secretion by human airway epithelial cells) of -
agonists modulated by AMs using HEK293 cells expressing human β2AR and human ASM/airway epithelial cells,
murine and human lung slices, and transgenic mice expressing human β2AR in smooth muscle. Previous studies have
demonstrated that -agonists promote asthma pathology in a β2AR-arrestin-dependent manner in murine models.
Enhancing canonical β2AR-Gs signaling may overcome the harmful effects of -agonists. We will assess the
therapeutic benefit of AMs in a murine model of asthma and human lung slices (Aim 3). We anticipate that the PAMs of
2AR will act in a biased fashion to augment desirable Gs signaling and functional effects of -agonists, providing
a basis for exploring a biased AM-based therapeutic approach to improve the efficacy of current -agonists."

Environmental chemical exposure has been linked to increases in cancer incidence, birth and developmental
defects, impaired cognitive development, and neurodegenerative disease. However, even as the number of
manufactured chemicals in the environment grows into the hundreds-of-thousands, comprehensive data on the
human and environmental health hazards remain sparse to nonexistent. The data are especially sparse
regarding questions of differential susceptibility, where gene-environment interaction (GxE) effects stemming
from individual genetic variation play an important role in health outcomes. Thus, understanding the role of
GxE in differential susceptibility to an expanding chemical exposome is key to protecting public health—
particularly that of vulnerable populations. We propose a solution that combines novel analytics with the power
of new high-throughput screening technologies to detect GxE underlying differential susceptibility in a diverse
population of zebrafish. Our three Specific Aims will (1) Identify environmental chemicals that induce the
greatest differences in population disease susceptibility; (2) Identify critical exposure concentrations and
confirm genetic heritability of population susceptibility differences; and (3) Identify and experimentally validate
genomic regions associated with differential susceptibility to chemical exposure. The immediate impact of this
proposal will be novel empirical evidence for the role of GxE in differential population susceptibility. The lasting
significance of this proposal will be a scalable, sustainable system to rapidly address questions of differential
genetic susceptibility to an expanding chemical exposome. The data-driven, bioinformatic approaches
developed here will be extensible to other systems for identifying patterns of phenotypic variation suggesting

As cannabis legalization continues to spread across the United States, average Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
concentrations in recreational products have significantly increased, with THC levels as high as 90-95%. Our
preliminary data suggest that concentrate use elicits blood THC levels more than twice as high as cannabis
flower use, and that concentrate use is associated with greater withdrawal, tolerance, and Cannabis Use
Disorder (CUD), prompting concern about the risks of these high potency products in relation to problem use
and CUD. No prior study has evaluated effective treatments to reduce cannabis use in this high risk group.
Several previous studies have found that the non-intoxicating cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD), which may
antagonize the effects of THC on CB1 and CB2 receptors, reduces cannabis use and CUD-related symptoms,
such as affective disturbance and withdrawal. Results of these studies are promising, but limited to synthetic or
isolated forms of CBD that are not widely available. There have been no tests of the hemp-derived CBD that is
widely available without a prescription across the U.S. Importantly, hemp-derived CBD comes in two forms, one
with a small amount of THC (~0.3% THC, full spectrum; fsCBD) and one without THC (0% THC; broad spectrum;
bsCBD). It is possible that a small amount of THC may confer additional benefits with respect to withdrawal and
related affective disturbance, and in turn be beneficial for reducing THC use overall. Consistent with this
hypothesis, pilot data from our lab suggest that CBD, that also contains low levels of THC, reduces THC drug
reward, withdrawal, anxiety, and overall THC use in heavy concentrate users, supporting the potential for hemp-
derived CBD to reduce THC use and mitigate withdrawal in this high risk group. However, no placebo-controlled
trial has been conducted comparing hemp-derived CBD with and without THC on reducing THC use.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to conduct a placebo-controlled RCT comparing the effects of
hemp-derived CBD (fsCBD vs. bsCBD vs. placebo) on reducing THC use in concentrate users with CUD.
150 adult treatment seeking concentrate users with DSM5 CUD will be recruited to complete an eight-week
protocol. Participants will be randomly assigned to take 400 mg of either hemp-derived bsCBD (contains no
THC), hemp-derived fsCBD (contains low levels of THC), or matched placebo (50 participants per group) daily
for eight weeks. All participants will receive a multi-session empirically supported psychological intervention to
support cannabis use reduction during the trial. Participants will be assessed for changes in THC use [self-
reported mg of THC used and levels of THC’s metabolite 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-THC (THC-COOH)] and CUD
symptoms, as well as levels of CBD and CBD’s metabolite, 7-Carboxy-Cannabidiol (CBD-COOH) to monitor
medication adherence. Primary outcomes include reduction in THC exposure [via self-reported amount used
and urine THC-COOH (standardized for creatinine)], CUD symptoms, and withdrawal symptoms, including
affective, physiological, and physical symptom facets, across the 8 week study."

BubR1 is a key regulator of aging through suppressing cellular senescence and is a critical tumor suppressor
through its role in maintaining genome integrity by sustaining fidelity in chromosomal segregation during
mitosis through control of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Importantly, BubR1 levels decline with age putting
it at the intersection of aging and age-related diseases such as cancer. Loss of BubR1 with age is attributed, in
part, through its increased ubiquitin-proteasomal mediated degradation, which can be blocked by increasing
the activity of the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT2. However, the E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) involved in
promoting the decline in BubR1 with age and under conditions of stress remain elusive.
 We identified the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate recognition subunit -TRCP1
as an interactor of BubR1, which targets BubR1 for ubiquitination and degradation. BubR1 contains a putative
binding domain for -TRCP1 (known as a degron motif), which lies adjacent to the acetylated lysine controlled
by SIRT2 suggesting a cross talk between SIRT2-regulated acetylation and ubiquitination of BubR1 by -
TRCP1. Furthermore, -TRCP1 is involved in ubiquitination and degradation of key regulators of genome
stability and cancer such as CHK1 and Cyclin D1 in response to cellular stress, including nutrient deprivation.
Similarly, BubR1 protein levels are destabilized in response to glucose deprivation, suggesting a putative role
for -TRCP1 in regulating BubR1 under physiological stress conditions as well as during the natural aging
process. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that -TRCP1 is a key regulator of BubR1 protein
stability to control aging and disease.
 To test this hypothesis, we developed two specific aims. In aim 1 we will define the posttranslational
regulation of BubR1 by -TRCP1 at the molecular level, and its impact on cellular senescence and organismal
lifespan. These studies will investigate the upstream and downstream pathways by which -TRCP regulates
BubR1 protein stability, and its involvement in the promoting the decline of BubR1 with age. In aim 2 we will
determine the role of -TRCP1-mediated protein degradation of BubR1 under conditions of cellular stress
including glucose deprivation by delineating the molecular mechanisms linking cellular sensing of nutrient
stress to ubiquitin-proteasomal mediated degradation of BubR1. In addition, we will assess the consequences
of altering BubR1 and other regulators of genome stability in the cellular response to glucose restrictive
conditions. Finally, we will elucidate the role of -TRCP1 in proteome remodeling during the cellular response
to glucose restriction conditions using an unbiased proteomics-based interaction screen. The overall goal of
this proposal is to elucidate at the molecular and cellular level the role of -TRCP in controlling key regulators
of genomic stability including BubR1 during cellular stress in aging and disease, which will provide the impetus
to develop novel therapeutic interventions for aging and age-related diseases through stabilization of BubR1."

Bacteroides is one of the most abundant genera of the human gut microbiota, representing nearly one-third of
the total composition. Bacteroides spp. participate in gut homeostasis and the development of the immune
system, being able to promote both health and disease states. Bacteroides spp. unlike other bacteria, produce
large quantities of uniformly-sized outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) that present distinct protein composition
when compared to the outer membrane (OM). These OMVs are composed mainly of lipoproteins with protease
and glycosidase activity. Bacteroides OMVs have been proposed to play pivotal roles in immune modulation,
nutrient degradation, and interbacterial mutualistic interactions. Despite their physiological relevance, no
mechanism for OMVs biogenesis has been yet established.
Recently, we have developed molecular tools that allow the differentiation between bona fide vesicles from lysis
byproducts in live Bacteroides strains expressing differentially labeled OMVs- and OM-specific proteins.
Moreover, based on specific OMVs markers fused to nano-luciferase, we developed the first high-throughput
screen to identify genes involved in OMV biogenesis. The screening for mutants displaying hyper- or hypo-
vesiculation resulted in the identification of genes involved in OMV biogenesis. Mutagenes of the gene encoding
the protein BT_3341 completely abrogated OMV formation. Preliminary experiments suggest that this strain is
not able to surface display the respective glycosylhydrolases required for degradation of glycans. Additionally,
we identified two anti-sigma factors with unique structural features. These two proteins appear to span across
the bacterial outer and inner membranes, connecting the extracellular space with the bacterial cytoplasm. Thus,
we named these proteins Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factors (DMA) family. Mutations of DMA1 and
DMA2 dramatically increase vesiculation, suggesting that they regulate OMV biogenesis.
The goal of this proposal is to further understand the mechanism of OMV biogenesis in Bacteroides. In Aim 1,
we propose to characterize the novel DMA family and their role in OMV biogenesis. In Aim 2 we will determine
the role of BT_3341 and identify additional components of this machinery in OMV biogenesis. In Aim 3 will
quantify and visualize OMV formation and evaluate the importance of OMV for fitness in vivo. Our work will
generate novel basic knowledge on this poorly understood process in bacteria, and lay the foundation for in-
depth investigations into the role of Bacteroides OMVs within the gut. Due to their suspected role in healthy and
disease states, this research may lead in the future to the production of novel OMV-based therapies applicable
to diseases involving gut dysbiosis, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)."
10919177,"Calcium imaging allows recording from 100s of neurons in a single wide field of view, giving rise
to extremely high dimensionality data. Current analysis standards employ descriptive statistics
that summarize neuronal responses into single quantitative metrics, discounting the temporal
dynamics of individual cells and local networks. In contrast, machine learning, especially
dimensionality reduction models, provide more nuanced analysis that considers the temporal
patterns and groupings among cells. While previous work has attempted to reduce the neuronal
activity to very low dimensional manifolds, these methods result in outputs that are difficult to
understand. In this work, we adapt Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), an easily
interpretable dimensionality reduction method to analyze shifts in neuronal network dynamics
that arise as a function of different experimental contexts. We will apply our framework to study
the neuronal network dynamics of two different contexts: 1) the primary somatosensory cortex
(S1) under increasing concentrations of anesthesia, and 2) the hippocampus during optogenetic
stimulation of memory-encoding ensembles of neurons. We have successfully adapted and
characterized a series of dimensionality reduction methods and have demonstrated NMF is a
superior method to extract underlying structure from calcium recordings. Initial analyses have
extracted ordered, low-dimensional, internal structure not detectable with traditional statistics.
This research will be conducted at Boston University, taking advantage of the numerous
multidisciplinary research centers (Center for Systems Neuroscience, Neurophotonics Center,
Rafik B. Hariri Institute for Computing and Computational Science & Engineering). These
institutes, consisting of highly diverse and renowned groups of faculty, create a highly
collaborative environment for interdisciplinary research, allowing scientists to pursue interesting
questions not directly in their expertise. Further, a combination of academic training,
development of technical skills, analytical problem solving, scientific communication,
professional development, and consistent mentorship will ensure the project has the highest
potential to succeed possible."
10827179,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
All animal behaviors and cognition require precise assembly of neural circuits. Despite a highly complex
environment in the central nervous system, neurons faithfully recognize their precise partners and establish
synaptic connections. Precise connectivity has been well demonstrated across many organisms, but the
mechanisms underlying this specificity remain unclear. Cell surfaces proteins (CSPs) have been implicated in
establishing correct connectivity, specifically by serving as “identification tags”. In Drosophila, two CSP
subfamilies of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), the Dprs and DIPs, have garnered significant attention
due to their multifaceted roles in nervous system development. The 32 members of the Dpr and DIP
subfamilies are GPI-anchored, and several interacting pairs were demonstrated to have roles in instructing
connectivity in several circuits. For example, DIP-α is required for instructing connectivity between motor
neurons (MNs) and muscles in the motor system and between interneurons (INs) in the visual circuit. Our
preliminary data suggests that DIP-α localizes to the dendrites of MNs as well, suggesting a potential role in
IN-MN recognition. Despite their fundamental roles in various circuits, the signaling mechanism(s) underlying
DIP/Dpr functions remains unclear. This proposal will test two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses: Aim 1) DIPs
and Dprs instruct IN-MN connectivity and Aim 2) DIPs and Dprs interact with other CSP co-receptors to
transduce cellular signals. I will focus on DIP-α because of its implications in connectivity, cell survival, and
synaptic development; however, I hypothesize that some signaling components will be shared between
Dpr/DIP members. In Aim 1, I will reconstruct MN dendrite morphology and synaptic connectivity between a
MN and its presynaptic INs. I will determine if known DIP-α interactors, Dpr6/10, are required and investigate
the functional outcome of disrupting DIP-α-dependent connectivity. In Aim 2, I will use proximity labeling to
uncover candidate DIP-α co-receptors in an unbiased manner, and I will validate them biochemically and
genetically. This proposal will combine interdisciplinary and innovative approaches, including optogenetics,
electrophysiology, biochemistry, microscopy, proteomics, and bioinformatics to elucidate fundamental
mechanisms underlying synaptic connectivity. The proposed work will address significant knowledge gaps in
central motor circuit connectivity and signaling mechanisms of GPI-anchored proteins. The vertebrate
orthologs of DIPs/Dprs, the IgLONs, are also GPI-anchored and are associated with various diseases,
including Alzheimer’s disease and autism spectrum disorder. Thus, our proposed study may also contribute to
our understanding of the molecular processes disrupted in specific neurological disorders."

Chronic inflammation disrupts bone metabolism and promotes bone loss. Periodontitis and peri-implantitis are
the most common inflammatory bone diseases in the oral cavity. In such an inflammatory environment, bone
formation and bone resorption uncouple, leading to inflammatory bone damage, tooth loss, and dental implant
failure. In this study, we propose a novel mechanism by which F-BOX Protein11 (FBXO11) regulates bone
development and inflammation. FBXO11 is a protein-coding gene associated with otitis media.
Additionally, it functions in a broad range of biological processes including melanocyte apoptosis, cell cycle
regulation, cell migration, B-cell differentiation, and epithelial cancer progression. However, the effect of
FBXO11 on bone development and inflammation has not been determined. Our preliminary studies in
murine osteoblasts and genomic animal model showed that FBXO11 is a critical signaling molecule
governing osteogenic differentiation by inhibiting Snail1/ lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1).
Furthermore, we found that the FBXO11/Snail1/LSD1 signaling axis is an important mechanism
underlying inflammatory bone loss in cases of chronic inflammation, such as periodontitis and peri-
implantitis. The novel mechanisms identified in our proposed studies will be critical for developing molecular
strategies to prevent bone loss and promote bone regeneration in periodontal and peri-implant infection. Three
specific aims will address the overarching hypothesis that FBXO11 regulates osteogenic differentiation in bone
development and inflammation. Specific Aim1 will determine if FBXO11 is essential for osteogenic
differentiation and bone growth by using FBXO11- overexpressing and knockdown osteogenic cells cultures,
bone transplant experiment, and a conditional FBXO11 knockout mouse model. Specific Aim 2 will determine if
FBXO11/Snail1/LSD1 regulatory axis contributes to inflammatory bone remodeling in the polymicrobial
periodontitis and peri-implantitis animals. Specific Aim 3 will determine if we can render this FBXO11 axis as
novel targets to treat periodontitis and peri-implantitis that represent significant health and economic burden
world widely. We propose two innovative approaches, gene therapy by genetically engineering FBXO11
transgene in osteoblasts and a local intervention with a specific LSD1 inhibitor trans-2-phenylcyclopropylamine
(2-PCPA), an FDA-approved antidepressant medication to prevent bone loss and promote bone regeneration.
If this proposed study validates our hypothesis of repurposing of 2-PCPA to treat inflammatory bone disease,
we will consider advancing the use of 2-PCPA to treat chronic periodontitis and peri-implantitis into clinical
studies."

Environmental Health: Transformative Research Undergraduate Experiences (E-H-TRUE) research
education program at the University of Arizona (UA) seeks to recruit, educate and retain 5 undergraduate
students every year who are underrepresented in environmental health sciences over five-year period. UA
has a long record of accomplishment to train and retain under-representative students: more than 40% new
freshman students from under-representative groups, raking #1 in PhDs earned by Naïve American
students and #8 in the number of PhDs earned by Hispanic/Latino students. UA has received status as
an American Indian/Alaska Native and a Hispanic Serving Institution. In E-H-TRUE, we bring together two
preeminent programs: the UA Center for Toxicology and the UA Undergraduate Research Program (UBRP)
to provide the top-notch research training in environmental health sciences. On the research side, the UA
Center for Toxicology, one of leading toxicology research and training centers in the world, is home to the
NIEHS-funded Southwest Environmental Health Sciences Center (SWEHSC) and the UA Superfund
Research Program. On the undergraduate education side, UBRP has served as a model for high-quality
undergraduate research training for more than 30 years. Through established networks by UBRP, we will
initiate early contact with freshman/sophomore undergraduates to identify talented undergraduate
candidates from under-representative groups who are interested in environmental health science
research. The well-designed educational component of E-H-TRUE will include a specifically designed
course work in environmental health sciences to expose students to toxicology, immunology,
epidemiology and government regulation. Program participants will receive hand-on training in research
laboratories. Students will work with their mentors and laboratory collaborators to learn how to review
literature, generate hypothesis, design step-by-step experimentation to test hypothesis, document
results, and deliver presentable data by due dates. The program will emphasize collaboration and near-
peer mentoring by capitalizing on the recently renewed NIEHS T32 training program (continuously funded for
40 years). The E-H-TRUE program will also facilitate community outreach activities in environmental health
science through the established outreach core in SWEHSC. Finally, we have implemented a
rigorous evaluation plan to measure the success and impact of the program. The main goal of the program is
to provide students with research experiences and encourage them pursuing Ph.D. or professional degrees
to be active in environmental science research."
10828338,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The number one preventable cause of death in the world is tobacco use. Cigarette smoking in particular, costs
an estimated $300 billion due to expenses related to medical care and lost productivity. Despite similar smoking
prevalence rates, Blacks suffer disproportionately from smoking-related harms compared to Whites. Sleep
disparities such as shortened sleep duration, shorter circadian periodicity, earlier chronotype, and increased
variability of sleep timing have been reported more frequently in Blacks compared to Whites. Given that poor
sleep quality predicts relapse from smoking cessation programs, particularly among socioeconomically
disadvantaged adults, sleep deficiencies and irregular timing of sleep may impact smoking craving and
withdrawal symptoms over the course of the 24-hour day. Surprisingly, few studies have examined these
temporal patterns of smoking and craving, and none with regard to sleep disruption, chronotype or racial
disparities. A better understanding of these factors may explain heterogeneity within the smoking population,
especially in minorities. Thus, the purpose of this proposal is to test the central hypothesis that the impact of
chronotype and impaired sleep on cigarette usage as well as smoking dependence, urge/craving, and withdrawal
depends on race. Three specific aims will determine: contributions of sleep timing and sleep quality and quantity
to racial disparities in smoking status (Aim 1), objective sleep characteristics and smoking behavior among
blacks and whites who smoke cigarettes (Aim 2), and whether sleep restriction modifies craving and withdrawal
in racially diverse smokers (Aim 3). Specifically, we will utilize self-report questionnaires, objective measures of
sleep quality and timing (actigraphy) and circadian phase (dim light melatonin onset), as well as ecological
momentary assessment of cigarette use, smoking urges, cravings, and withdrawal symptoms to identify circadian
and sleep characteristics that are most strongly associated with smoking status, heaviness of smoking and
dependence among blacks and whites. Finally, we will test whether acute sleep restriction (4 hours of time-in-
bed) versus sleep extension (10 hours of time-in-bed) modifies craving and withdrawal symptoms following
cessation in black and white smokers. If successful, the results of this study will result in identification of circadian
dysfunction and insufficient sleep as mechanisms that underlie the association between sleep and cigarette
smoking behaviors and dependence in diverse populations. Moreover, these findings are likely to inform
clinicians of the importance of sleep and sleep timing on cigarette smoking behaviors and dependence that will
help in the development of novel interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by tobacco use."

10826127,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The constant flow of sensory information into the nervous system is fundamental for interaction with the world.
The brain’s ability to flexibly adjust sensitivity to various sensory stimuli is context-dependent and can be shifted
on acute or chronic time scales in different internal states. This change can be advantageous or maladaptive;
prey animals like rodents may benefit from becoming hypersensitive to sensory cues, as in a mouse listening for
evidence of a predator, but chronic shifts in sensory processing may become detrimental and overwhelming.
Importantly, a chronic shift in internal state can impact tactile processing – for example, stress induced by social
isolation has significant effects on several measures of affective behavior and can lead to aberrant increases in
tactile sensitivity. However, the neural circuit mechanisms underlying this shift in responsivity to touch remain
unknown. The cuneate nucleus of the brainstem (Cu) is responsible for conveying tactile information from the
upper body to higher-order sensorimotor regions. Recent work in the Azim lab showed that local inhibitory
networks envelop the Cu in a ‘shell’ and can act to reduce or amplify responses to tactile signals. These inhibitory
networks are modulated by top-down pathways that can regulate the transmission of incoming information, likely
as a means of attenuating disruptive feedback while facilitating salient signals. Preliminary experiments designed
to identify the origins of these top-down modulatory projections revealed that the central amygdala (CeA)
provides direct inputs to the Cu inhibitory shell (CeA-Cu). Due to its involvement in stress and isolation, the CeA
has emerged as a compelling candidate region linking chronic social isolation to tactile hypersensitivity.
Projections from CeA are almost exclusively inhibitory, leading to the possibility that they inhibit Cu shell neurons,
thus, disinhibiting (i.e., amplifying) tactile feedback transmitted through the Cu. The overarching goals of this
proposal are to investigate how this pathway influences sensory signals under normal and pathological
conditions. The central hypotheses are that: a) top-down projections from the CeA disinhibit the transmission
of touch information carried through the brainstem; and b) that these circuits are implicated in the aberrant
increase in tactile sensitivity following social isolation. To test these ideas, CeA-Cu projections will be activated
and silenced using optogenetic approaches in mice, and tactile sensitivity will be measured using three distinct
tactile behavioral assays. These perturbations will then be performed in socially isolated mice to determine if
optogenetic activation is sufficient to “rescue” normal tactile processing. Finally, fiber photometry will be
employed to measure neural activity at each component of the pathway following social isolation and during
optogenetic stimulation – CeA neurons, their targets in the Cu shell, and the cuneolemniscal neurons that receive
tactile inputs and convey these signals to the thalamus. This research will lead to better understanding of how
altered internal states affect somatosensation and provide insight into mechanistic causes of sensory processing
disorders."
10928756,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
As part of daily life, we regularly engage in well-learned and repetitive sequences of motor actions, such as
commuting to work. Simultaneously, we are bound to encounter a stream of novel episodic information (e.g.,
getting a funny text during your commute), which we might hope to retain in long-term memory. Despite the
prevalence of learned motor sequences in day-to-day experience, their impact on memory for concurrent
episodic events is largely unknown. In the current proposal, I will explore how learned actions scaffold memory
for the way that novel events unfold across time. Temporal information is a fundamental dimension of episodic
memory, underlying our capacity to both anticipate future events and interpret the past. Existing work provides
limited evidence for cooperative interactions between episodic memory and motor actions, finding that motor
behavior during novel encoding, relative to passive observation, enhances subsequent item memory. However,
this work has not considered the familiarity we have with the actions we take, nor does it address the formation
of episodic memories that are rich in temporal structure. If we are to understand how memories are formed in
the active and dynamic environments of everyday life, these gaps must be addressed. To this end, I propose to
utilize a newly-developed task in which participants encode novel episodic sequences during the execution of
learned vs. unfamiliar motor action sequences. Initial behavioral work shows that this task produces reliable
enhancements in temporal order memory for novel item sequences encountered alongside learned actions. I
will use fMRI to investigate the neural bases of this temporal memory effect, focusing in particular on
contributions of the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). My hypotheses build on extant theories
that these regions work in tandem to integrate novel episodic experiences with existing knowledge structures
(e.g., learned motor patterns) in the service of memory behavior. In Aim 1, I will assess whether learned motor
behaviors elicit systems-level changes in coordinated activity between hippocampus and mPFC, which in turn
support the binding of novel episodic information with an existing motor sequence memory. In Aim 2, I will
focus on the retrieval of novel episodes, determining whether the reactivation of learned motor representations
in mPFC facilitates access to temporal order information, and how the hippocampus is involved in this process.
Together, these aims will provide insight into how our everyday motor behaviors impact memory for concurrent
experiences. They also have the potential to further our understanding of episodic memory dysfunction in
clinical populations — both how it arises in patients with motor impairments, and how it can be remedied in
those where motor function remains intact. Through this project, I will advance my understanding of the neural
bases of episodic and motor memory systems, while also receiving training in fMRI task design, advanced
neuroimaging analyses, and professional skills. All research will be conducted at Columbia University, which is
home to a renowned community of memory researchers and state-of-the-art neuroimaging facilities."
10826250,"Project Summary
Cell identity is acquired by integrating multiple signaling inputs that establish complex gene regulatory
networks over time. These signals are converted into expression profiles by the binding of transcription factors
to non-coding regions of DNA known as enhancers. In human adipogenesis, multiple inputs converge onto a
single gene, PPARG. PPARG responds to these inputs through two ""super-enhancers"", which are dense
collections of individual enhancers. The myriad of input signals that feed into adipogenesis and drive PPARG
activation suggests the presence of complex regulatory logic within the two super-enhancers located up- and
downstream of the PPARG coding region. For instance, Creb1 is an early input in adipogenesis that appears
dispensable later, C/EBPb is required later and subsequently activates C/EBPa to maintain PPARG
transcription, and finally PPARG itself autoregulates to drive PPARG output even further, as adipocytes adopt
their terminal fate. The large genomic distances between enhancers and promoter, and the observation that
chromatin remodeling is a key bottleneck in adipogenesis suggesta hierarchical model of PPARγ activation.
We will systematically determine which functional units of the PPARG super-enhancers respond to diverse
inputs by silencing individual super-enhancer modules in a temporally resolved manner during adipogenesis.
We will combine these findings with direct observation and manipulation of chromatin contacts in single cells, in
order to test whether efficient signal transduction from super-enhancers to promoter requires 2-way
enhancer-promoter chromatin loops or complex multi-way contacts between super-enhancer modules and the
promoter."
10856366,"Summary
The goal of this project is to develop a novel histotripsy device for non-invasive treatment of heterogeneous
osteosarcoma tumors (OS). OS are malignant bone tumors that develop in both children and adults. Long-term
survival rates for patients with metastatic and non-metastatic OS are around 20% and 70%, respectively,
highlighting the devastating nature of this disease. Limb salvage surgery or amputation are first-line treatments
for primary appendicular OS, but these remain associated with high complication rates and decreased mobility
and function. Novel treatments for OS are needed to improve outcomes. Histotripsy is a non-invasive ultrasound
therapy that mechanically ablates tumors into acellular debris via controlled acoustic cavitation. Histotripsy can
be tissue-selective, where neurovascular bundles, vessels, and bone can be preserved while the tumor is
completely disrupted to acellular debris. Histotripsy appears to be well-suited for OS with the ability to serve as
a non-surgical limb salvage treatment option, with promising results noted in preliminary studies. Despite this
promise, OS treatment with histotripsy presents unique challenges: 1) OS tumors exhibit high inter- and intra-
tumoral heterogeneity, with varying proportions of lytic and proliferative bone and soft tissue tumor proliferation,
requiring optimized treatment strategies for complete and uniform ablation of all OS phenotypes. 2) OS tumors
grow close to critical structures. While histotripsy has been shown to be tissue-selective for other applications,
there remains a need to develop methods for selectively ablating OS tumors while preserving healthy bone,
nerves, vessels, and connective tissue. 3) Histotripsy is typically guided by real-time ultrasound imaging, which
is not feasible for a subset of OS tumors due to bone obstruction, requiring improved targeting and monitoring
techniques. In this proposal, we will develop an integrated image-guided histotripsy system for the precise
targeting and ablation of OS tumors. The system will consist of a phased array transducer with transmit-receive
capability for 3D cavitation monitoring, image-fusion targeting (CT/MRI), and a fully automated robotic treatment
technique with strategies for achieving uniform and complete ablation of heterogeneous OS tumors. We propose
the following three aims. Aim 1: Design and construct an integrated histotripsy OS system consisting of an array
transducer with transmit-receive capabilities for 3D cavitation imaging and image-fusion targeting. Aim 2:
Develop patient specific treatment methods with optimized parameters for complete, uniform, and tissue-
selective OS ablation. Aim 3: Test the in vivo safety and efficacy of the integrated OS system (Aim 1) and
optimized parameters for uniform and safe treatment of OS (Aim 2) in canine OS patients at the Virginia Tech
Animal Cancer Care and Research Center. This project will result in a human prototype histotripsy system with
unique treatment and monitoring capabilities as well as parameters optimized for OS. The canine patients are
the best large animal model to test the safety and efficacy of histotripsy and accelerate clinical translation, and
the veterinary treatment is another application for histotripsy OS therapy before the FDA approval of human use."
10824698,"The autogenous arteriovenous (A-V) fistula represents the most important lifeline of >600,000 Americans
currently on hemodialysis. However, ~40 percent of newly created fistulas cannot be used for dialysis
without a salvage procedure because stenosis (narrowing) prevents them from reaching the necessary
blood flow. This problem represents significant comorbidity for the end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
population and a substantial economic burden that currently surpasses $2 billion annually. Most troubling
about this glaring statistic is that it has plateaued over the past five decades, highlighting a pressing need for
revamped efforts to improve vascular access outcomes using novel and innovative therapeutic approaches.
This translational proposal establishes a new modality to treat post-operative A-V fistula failure using an
emerging anti-inflammatory concept. We have built this proposal upon the premise that a newly discovered
agonist of Mac-1 integrin prevents stenosis in A-V fistulas by controlling post-operative inflammatory activity.
Macrophages and other myeloid inflammatory cells control the underlying causes of stenosis, such as the
development of post-operative intimal hyperplasia (IH) and fibrosis. Herein we hypothesize that
pharmacological and genetic activation of the Mac-1 integrin is sufficient to control myeloid- derived
inflammatory cell infiltration in the fistula without compromising access maturation. We also hypothesize
that activation of the Mac-1 integrin attenuates the RAGE signaling in macrophages that leads to inward
remodeling in newly created A-V fistulas. Our scientific premise is supported by published and preliminary
data that demonstrate our experience with animal models to study fistula maturation biology. We will test our
hypothesis in three specific aims and five experimental layouts to: 1) demonstrate that increased monocyte
adhesion following Mac-1 activation protects experimental A-V fistulas from failure; 2) demonstrate the anti-
inflammatory mechanism following Mac-1 activation in the fistula wall; and 3) demonstrate that Mac-1
activation attenuates post-operative inflammation, IH, and stenosis in preclinical A-V fistulas. We will
combine fine microsurgical techniques and transgenic mice to achieve our goals successfully. In conclusion,
successful completion of this proposal will pave the way to the design of new drugs using a novel mode of
action to effectively target A-V fistula fibrosis and IH and reduce vascular access complications."

Prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) remains a pressing public health concern. At least 10 percent of pregnant
individuals in the US report smoking cigarettes (or e-Cigs) during gestation. PNE is linked to neurodevelopmental
disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorders. Nicotine, via cholinergic
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), enhances cholinergic activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC),
dysregulating development and increasing the risk for PFC-linked neurodevelopmental disorders. PFC-linked
neurodevelopmental disorders point at disruptions in synapse maturation leading to synaptic dysfunction.
However, the mechanisms by which nAChR signaling, and nicotine exposure, influence synapse maturation are
unknown. Our preliminary studies found that cholinergic denervation in the developing PFC impairs excitatory
synapse maturation. Additionally, we found nicotine treatment promoted synapse maturation in the absence of
glutamatergic activity. This proposal is composed of two aims which seek to test the hypothesis that postsynaptic
nAChR signaling modulates excitatory synapse maturation in the developing PFC. The first aim uses a
combination of innovative techniques including two-photon uncaging of glutamate, chemogenetics,
electrophysiology, and pharmacology to determine if the up-regulation of endogenous cholinergic activity
promotes synaptic maturation. The second aim uses two-photon, two-color uncaging of nicotine and glutamate,
electrophysiology, and pharmacology to elucidate the synaptic and molecular mechanisms involved in the
nicotinic signaling-mediated maturation of synapses. In sum, the studies outlined in this proposal will shed light
to the cellular, synaptic, and molecular mechanisms involved in the nicotine-induced maturation of excitatory
synapses. Results from this project will advance efforts towards mitigating the impact of neurodevelopmental
disorders that result from PNE."

Malaria caused over 619 thousand deaths and resulted in the infection of more than 247 million individuals in
2021. Emergence of resistance to single and combination frontline-therapeutics have been reported in endemic
areas and threatens the efforts to eradicate the disease. We believe that continued development of 4-
aminoquinolines holds immense un-tapped therapeutic and clinical potential to overcome emerging multi-drug
resistant (MDR) strains of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), the deadliest species of malaria parasite.
To this end, I developed an initial compound screen, inspired from previous work in our lab, which produced two
separate compounds, MH01-128 and MH01-173, both exhibiting low nanomolar antiplasmodial activity in an in
vitro proliferation assay against MDR Pf. In addition, the two compounds demonstrated parasite clearance in a
murine malaria model; however, both compounds suffer from metabolic instability, measured in pooled murine
liver microsomes. To increase metabolic stability of MH01-173, I performed an iterative structure activity
relationship study that produced the compound MH02-060. This next-generation compound exhibited enhanced
metabolic stability and produced a non-recrudescence dose without change to intrinsic anti-plasmodial activity.
The work I propose hereafter aims to further develop MH02-060 as an antimalarial. In Aim 1 I will use an iterative
medicinal chemistry approach to select for compounds that maintain antiplasmodial activity versus MDR Pf,
favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and superior in vivo efficacy. In Aim 2, potential targets of MH02-060, will
be investigated using chemical biology techniques in tandem with heme binding assays. The scientific impact of
the successful completion of this project will result in a superior analog of MH02-060 that has the potential to be
accepted into the Medicines for Malaria Venture's antimalarial clinical development pipeline.
The completion of this proposal will result in my training in a diverse set of technical methodologies and
knowledge of antimalarial drug development. Along with the training that I will receive from Dr. Riscoe and
members of his lab, I will have additional training in: cell culture, in vitro antiplasmodial assays, and murine in
vivo experiments by Dr. Jane Kelly and Dr. Yuexin Li; bioanalytical sample preparation and analysis from Dr.
Andrea DeBarber; interpretation of proteomic data from Dr. Ashok Reddy; and optimization and use of the drug-
like probes from Dr. Michael Cohen, all from OHSU.
My position in Dr. Michael Riscoe's laboratory will provide me with institutional support from an exemplary
department and access to a large group of diverse PI's and trainees to aid in my scientific growth and training.
Development in these areas and amongst this institution will provide me with key skills and scientific development
to pursue a successful career as an independent academic investigator."

Our focus is identifying molecular signatures defining sickle cell disease and reduced vaccine response by
investigating multiple components of innate immunity and the quality and quantity of long-term adaptive immunity
among children with sickle cell disease. We propose a deep interrogation and a systems biology approach to
characterize changes in innate and adaptive immunity and whole-genome transcriptional response induced by
vaccination in a dysregulated inflammatory milieu linked to poor vaccine response. We have assembled an
interdisciplinary investigative group who have an existing successful collaboration infrastructure and has
expertise in human immunology, pediatric vaccine response, sickle cell disease, pneumococcal antibody
response, proteomics, and computational biology to carry out the proposed studies by 1) examining the innate
immune status of children with sickle cell disease; 2) elucidating innate and adaptive signatures of vaccination;
3) defining transcriptomic and proteomic signatures of vaccine response. We will leverage the recent advances
in single-cell and spatial immune profiling methods and shared immunologic and proteomic platforms to create
a novel resource for sickle cell disease patients and other vulnerable populations. We aim to provide
comprehensive mechanistic insights into sickle cell disease-related chronic inflammation and impaired vaccine

(LDHA), promotes aberrant lactylation of DNA topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) and EMILIN1, leading to TOP1 up-reg-
ulation and EMILIN1 deficiency, consequent up-regulation of pro-proliferative Akt-mTOR, Yap/Taz, TGFβ, in-
creased proliferation and survival. Our data also suggest that lactate over-production in PAH PASMC is self-
supported via glycolysis and EMILIN1-TGFβ1-HIF1α-LDHA circuit, and that lactate is secreted by PAH PASMC
and promotes proliferation of PA endothelial cells (PAEC) and adventitial fibroblasts (PAAF). We further report
that suppression of LDHA-lactate axis reduces proliferation and induces apoptosis in human PAH PASMC, re-
verses pulmonary vascular remodeling and experimental PH in mice. We propose to elucidate the role and
mechanisms of regulation and function of LDHA-lactate signaling in PAH pulmonary vasculature and explore the
benefits of targeting this pathway to correct mechanistic abnormalities and reverse PA remodeling and PH. Spe-
cifically, we will: (1) critically test the role of LDHA-lactate in PAH PASMC proliferation and survival, pulmonary
vascular remodeling and PH using human PAH and non-diseased PASMC and lung tissue samples and SM-
specific Ldhaknock-out mice; determine the relationship among LDHA-lactate, lactylation of TOP1 and EMILIN1,
and Yap/Taz, Akt-mTOR, and TGFβ1 in regulating PASMC proliferation and survival; (2) investigate whether
lactate over-production is supported through up-regulation of glycolysis and EMILIN-TGFβ1-HIF1α-LDHA feed-
forward loop, evaluate the metabolic consequences of lactate over-production, and determine the role of
PASMC-secreted lactate in the proliferation of PAEC and PAAF; and (3) examine whether targeting lactate sig-
naling by LDHA inhibitor oxamate and TOP1 inhibitor indotecan selectively inhibits proliferation and induces
apoptosis in vitro in human PAH PASMC, reverses or attenuates experimental pulmonary vascular remodeling
and PH in rats. Proposed study will identify new critical mechanism of pulmonary vascular remodeling and dis-
sect new remodeling-focused molecular target(s) for therapeutic intervention.

Marital conflict is linked with a wide range of adjustment problems in both children and adults, and interparental
conflict may trigger parent-child conflict, causing cascading and reciprocal effects for the entire family.
Consequently, the way in which family conflicts are behaviorally expressed and managed is critical for family
well-being. The degree to which conflicts are communicated and resolved in a constructive versus destructive
manner greatly influences long-term relational satisfaction and child development. Research has yet to
disaggregate the range of processes accounting for beneficial effects of RCT trials designed to increase
constructive behavior on family outcomes, however, so the psychological mechanisms through which positive
changes operate are unclear. Thus, a critical need exists to identify these mechanisms of change through
multi-method, process-oriented analyses. My objective is to evaluate responses associated with an
intervention, the Family Communication Project (FCP), to test the central hypothesis that empathic
communication and perceived understanding are key mechanisms that help explain how the intervention
improved short-term conflict resolution and long-term emotional security and relational satisfaction within
families. The FCP was a multi-component four-week psycho-educational RCT intervention that focused on
family conflict, communication, and adolescent adjustment. Participants consisted of a community sample of
adolescents and their two primary caregivers (N = 225 families). Each family was randomly assigned to one of
two treatment groups or one of two control groups. Assessments were conducted out to 3-years post-
intervention, including observational coding of laboratory-based conflict discussions, daily dairies about family
conflict in the home, self-report questionnaires, and qualitative interviews. My project is guided by the following
three aims: (1) Model the micro-level effects of interspousal support during conflict interaction; (2) Evaluate
support and perceived understanding as longitudinal mediators of intervention effects on marital satisfaction,
adolescent emotional security, and adolescent adjustment; and (3) Conduct thematic analysis of interviews to
contextualize and corroborate the quantitative findings. These analyses may advance empirical and theoretical
bases for understanding the processes associated with constructive family conflict behavior, as well as how
changes in behavior are causally linked to relational family outcomes. These analyses may also help inform
the design of more effective or tailored family interventions. Finally, this proposal reflects an innovative use of
mixed methods to corroborate causal inferences and examine longitudinal change. Goals of the fellowship
training plan, which will take place at the University of Notre Dame, include: (1) Develop conceptual and
methodological expertise in family conflict communication processes and prevention/intervention research; (2)
Expand my expertise in data science, advanced quantitative analysis, and qualitative research methods; and
(3) Develop practice-based skills in family and organizational conflict resolution."
10826000,"Dysregulation of Hedgehog (HH) signaling is linked to catastrophic birth defects in infants and is an underlying
cause of the structural defects in a range of syndromes, including ciliopathies. The effects of HH signaling are
primarily mediated through de-repression of target genes, but the mechanisms by which GLI proteins act as
transcriptional repressors remain poorly understood. Recently, we found that GLI repressors prevent
transcription of target genes by deactivating their own enhancers through chromatin-based histone
deacetylation. We then found that GLI3 is present but apparently inert in early limb buds before the onset of
HH signaling. We hypothesize that GLI repression is normally regulated by the expression of co-repressors
rather than being the default state occurring in the absence of HH signaling. In Specific Aim 1 we will
determine how GLI3 repressor activity is inactive prior to the onset of Hedgehog signaling. We will determine if
GLI repression is inert because of sub-threshold protein kinase A activity or, alternatively, if it is triggered by
the onset of HH expression. In parallel, we will determine if the lack of GLI3 repression is due to an unexpected
early redundancy with GLI2. These findings will determine whether HH pathway members trigger GLI
transcriptional repression. In Specific Aim 2 we will determine how GLI transcriptional repression regulates
chromatin accessibility. GLI transcriptional repression causes both reductions in H3K27 acetylation as well as
reductions in ATAC-seq accessibility at GLI enhancers. We will determine if the reduced accessibility occurs
because of changes in nucleosomal density or because of reduced histone acetylation. Additionally, we
hypothesize that GLI3 transcriptional repression occurs through the NuRD complex, which uniquely contains
both the HDAC and chromatin remodeling activities that are observed with GLI3 repression. Our preliminary
data supports this hypothesis, indicating that GLI3 binds to CHD4, a component of the NuRD repressor
complex that mediates nucleosomal sliding. The results will provide a mechanistic understanding of how GLI
transcriptional repression controls chromatin accessibility to regulate HH target gene expression. In Specific
Aim 3, we will identify co-factors regulating GLI repressive activity. We hypothesize that GLI repression occurs
through the recruitment of an unknown co-repressor complex containing HDAC activity. We will test several
ranked candidate co-factors by determining if they bind to known GLI enhancers and if this binding is reduced
in limb buds lacking GLI3. In a complementary, unbiased approach, we will identify factors that bind to GLI3
on chromatin using an endogenously biotinylated GLI3 allele. The identification and subsequent validation of a
co-factor(s) mediating GLI repression will fill a major gap in our understanding of how HH signaling regulates
gene expression. Overall, these results will be impactful in illuminating a novel layer of HH pathway regulation
as well as enabling a mechanistic understanding of GLI transcriptional regulation that will be applicable to
understanding the full biological spectrum of HH-mediated responses."
10826005,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The search for a cure or treatments of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been largely unsuccessful, which
has compelled several neuroscience fields to develop novel methods to understand and treat the condition. One
such approach is the discovery of new unconventional animal models that naturally present AD-like traits. As a
member of Dr. Xiangmin Xu's lab, I have been able to contribute to these efforts by conducting neuropathological
characterizations of the Octodon degus (degu), a long-lived rodent native to Chile. This proposal focuses on the
outbred degu that, in a subset of their adult population, presents cognitive deficits accompanied by spontaneous
neuropathologies similar to those seen in human AD. I propose to create neuropathological, cytoarchitectural,
and spatial transcriptome maps that will be integrated with behavioral datasets to comprehensively assess AD-
like profiles in the outbred degu. I hypothesize that cognitively impaired degus will manifest neuropathology,
altered cytoarchitecture, and maladaptive spatial transcriptomic maps reminiscent of human AD that will reveal
novel therapeutic gene targets for the disease.
 The overall objective of this proposal is to create a comprehensive analysis of the outbred degu's AD-
like features. This will shed light on the overlap between degu-AD and human-AD, which will lay the grounds for
the degu's role in future AD research. I will divide degus into two groups based on their performance in an
ethologically relevant burrowing behavior test: cognitively impaired (AD-like) and cognitively healthy (Non-AD)
groups. The first aim of this proposal is to conduct a neuropathological and cytoarchitectural analysis (using
immunofluorescence and western blot protein quantification) in degu prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsal
hippocampus (dHIP). This will be complemented by the production of single-cell spatial transcriptomic maps in
PFC & dHIP using MERFISH (multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization) in aim 2. This will
provide a spatially resolved look at the maladaptive gene expression profiles of the cognitively impaired degu.
The proposal culminates with the integration of the data from aim 1 and aim 2 with behavioral datasets (burrowing
behavior, Y-maze, and open field tests). This will result in a multi-layered analysis of the degu from the
transcriptomic to the behavioral level featuring spatially correlated data. I plan to analyze these integrated
datasets to identify genes highly correlated with AD-like features in the degu that could yield therapeutic targets
to treat the disease.
 Dr. Xu and I have fleshed out a training plan to progress the development of my technical, writing,
mentorship, and leadership skills. I plan to perfect my skills conducting MERFISH experiments, analyzing -omic
data, writing manuscripts/grants, mentoring, and presenting research. All these will contribute towards my long-
term goal of becoming an independent scientist and an eventual professor at a research university."

 My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator and a leader in the fields of stem
cell engineering and regenerative medicine, with a focus on orthopedic applications. In particular, I will
contribute to improving cell therapeutic strategies for the repair and regeneration of dense connective tissues,
including meniscus and tendon. Meniscus injury and damage is the most common of knee injury, with over 1.8
million meniscal injuries being treated in the EU and the US each year. However, meniscal injuries have limited
repair and little is known regarding meniscus cell phenotype and mechano-regulation with development and
during disease/after injury. It is clear that the dynamic spatio-temporal organization of the genome is a central
determinant of gene expression and cell differentiation, and so it will be important to understand how 3D
genome architecture changes with meniscus development or in response to exogenous chemo-mechanical
cues to develop better cell therapeutic strategies. The goals of my proposed K01 work is to elucidate how
genome organization of cells within the knee meniscus change with development and degeneration, in both
animal and human cells. In addition, I will determine how chemo-mechanical cues (e.g. substrate stiffness and
mechanical loading) that change during development or degeneration regulate genome organization in
meniscus cells. Through the work, I will acquire expertise in 3D genome-architecture and techniques to
quantify chromatin fiber organization using super-resolution stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy
(STORM). I will also evaluate changes in epigenetic status using ChIP-PCR, and will evaluate gene expression
using the single cell-based fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in meniscus cells as a function of tissue
development or after injury and in response to mechanical input. Aim 1 will identify chromatin organization and
histone modifications at the nanoscale during meniscus development and degeneration using super-resolution
stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) imaging and genome wide analyses including ChIP-
PCR and RNA-FISH. Aim 2 will determine whether biophysical cues can establish and/or restore meniscus
specific genome organization, epigenetic landscape, and expression patterns in differentiating and
degenerative meniscus cells. This study will inform us to advance diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for
dense connective tissue repair and regeneration. Importantly, this K01 award will allow me to improve my
scientific knowledge and techniques, and will further provide important preliminary data for independent grant
applications."
10829849,"SUMMARY
 Dysregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway has been linked to cancer in multiple tissues. For example,
most colorectal cancer (CRC) cases (~90%) are associated with aberrant Wnt signaling, due in part to
mutations (>80%) associated with Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a multi-functional tumor suppressor
gene. Unfortunately, attempts to target aberrant Wnt signaling using drugs still face multiple hurdles due to
poor tumor cell targeting, negative side effects associated with required long-term treatments and a poor
understanding of the mechanisms of action. Consequently, there is an urgent need to further assess non-toxic
Wnt targeted therapeutic approaches. Therefore, this proposal seeks to develop novel membrane targeted
therapeutic approaches to abate abnormal Wnt signaling in the colon. The scientific premise that supports
the proposed research on Wnt receptor plasma membrane spatial dynamics is based on the fact that Wnt
receptors and their signaling are required for CRC development within the context of a mutant APC
background. This goal is supported by our novel discovery indicating that APC mutations causing abnormal
Wnt signaling are associated with biophysical distortions in the cell plasma membrane, thereby promoting Wnt
receptor nanoclustering and downstream signaling. We have also demonstrated that select membrane
targeted dietary bioactives (MTDBs) can restore normal plasma membrane signaling by correcting cancer-
causing biophysical distortions in the cell surface. In order to unravel the intricacies of membrane-based
cancer prevention strategies, we propose to use novel mouse, Drosophila (fruit fly) and human colon organoid
model systems to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which MTDBs reshape the cell plasma membrane
to suppress aberrant Wnt signaling.
 In Aim 1, we will further probe how mutated (oncogenic) APC perturbs cholesterol homeostasis in the
colonic crypt, thereby increasing plasma membrane order and lipid raft-dependent spatiotemporal dynamics.
In Aim 2, we will test our hypothesis that oncogenic APC-induced changes in cholesterol homeostasis alters
the spatiotemporal organization (nanoclustering) of Wnt signaling-associated receptors, thereby promoting
aberrant signaling. Aim 3 will examine the ability of MTDBs to attenuate aberrant Wnt signaling and colonic
neoplasia phenotypes associated with oncogenic APC in part by “normalizing” plasma membrane biophysical
properties.
Upon completion of our proposed work, we expect to elucidate precisely how MTDBs therapeutically
modify the cell membrane to suppress aberrant Wnt signaling and tumor formation in the colon. We propose
that our novel approach to reshape plasma membrane Wnt receptor nanoclusters is a feasible CRC prevention
or therapeutic strategy."

Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is one of the most highly infectious pathogens of the modern age,
characterized by a rapid loss in CD4+ T cells, which, if left untreated, results in acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome and a high likelihood of death due to complications. Over the last forty years, scientists have worked
endlessly to stop the progression of HIV-1 through a plethora of chemical inhibitors. Although these drugs have
been a boon to the affected communities, they only work prophylactically or to halt the spread post-infection. To
date, there has not been an effective method for eradicating HIV-1. The most likely method of eliminating the
disease within a patient relies upon using latency reversing agents (LRAs) to activate dormant integrated HIV-1,
thus allowing the immune system to target infected cells and clear the population. Unfortunately, most LRAs are
only partially effective, and latent HIV-1 tends to become recalcitrant with time. The current LRAs that have
shown efficacy act either through NF-κB signaling or altered transcription dynamics. ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) is
a post-translational modification (PTMs) directly linked to transcriptional activity and NF-κB signaling. Still, it has
never been looked at in the context of HIV-1 latency and reactivation. Thus, ADPr may serve as a novel
therapeutic target to eliminate latent HIV-1 reservoirs. The long-term goal of this project is to enhance the
understanding of ADPr in HIV-1 biology through biochemical, proteomic, and cellular assays. Preliminary results
in cell line models of HIV-1 latency show that ADPr preferentially targets proteins related to transcription and
chromatin accessibility following reactivation with prostratin. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify
the role PARP specific interactions during HIV-1 reactivation. The objective will be achieved by testing the central
hypothesis that ADPr-dependent signaling is altering transcriptional and immune signaling during HIV-1
reactivation. To test this hypothesis, the following three aims will be pursued. Aim 1: Identify global proteomic
changes to ADP-ribosylation during HIV-1 latency and reactivation. This aim will use mass spectrometry-based
proteomics to compare the differences in ADPr and protein phosphorylation following administration of minimally
overlapping LRAs to identify potential novel regulatory sites and interactors. Aim 2: Investigate PARP-HIV-1
Interactions in primary CD4+ T Cells using CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts. In this aim I will knockout PARP1, PARP11,
and PARP14 in primary resting CD4+ T cells from healthy donors to assess the physiological changes following
reactivation of replication-competent HIV-1. Aim 3: Systematically evaluate PARP1, PARP14 and Tat protein
interactions. In my final aim, I will identify PARP1, PARP14 and Tat-dependent protein-protein interactions during
HIV-1 reactivation to assess the direct role of PARP1 and PARP14 in mediating latency and reactivation.
Successful completion of the proposed research will significantly enhance our understanding of ADPr in HIV-1
and retrovirology. This will be a significant contribution as it will reveal novel therapeutic strategies to reactivate
HIV-1 and help eliminate latent reservoirs in CD4+ T cells."

Malaria and HIV remain major challenges in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and the risk of co-infection remains
high; complicated by drug-drug interactions, the potential for overlapping adverse events, as well as
bidirectional negative clinical impacts. For HIV, a near universal transition to dolutegravir (DTG)-based
regimens is occurring across the lifespan in SSA. While an improvement over existing regimens, emerging
data clearly link DTG with increases in body mass index and metabolic derangements. Prospective studies of
such changes in SSA pediatric settings are scarce and must be conducted to ensure that early life exposure to
DTG does not lead to potential longer-term negative health impacts in HIV-infected children. SSA also bears
the majority of the world's malaria burden. Treatment relies on artemisinin-based combination therapies
(ACTs), of which artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and amodiaquine-artesunate (AS-AQ) are most utilized in SSA.
ACTs combine a potent short-acting artemisinin derivative with a long-acting partner drug, an approach that
has improved efficacy for the immediate episode, but also provides some protection against new exposures to
infectious bites after treatment is completed. We have demonstrated reductions in piperaquine, another
important ACT partner drug when given with DTG, and anticipate reductions will occur with AL and AS-AQ.
Such bidirectional interactions must be urgently assessed in children to avoid any unintended negative
consequences on malaria and HIV outcomes. Unfortunately, resistance to artemisinin, the critical backbone of
all ACTs, has now been detected in multiple African countries, including Uganda, further emphasizing the need
to optimize treatment regimens. For the partner drug lumefantrine, our group has demonstrated that
pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure is a strong predictor of the risk of re-infection, and that less susceptible
parasites are able to tolerate higher concentrations of drug. Similar studies are necessary for the artemisinin
derivatives, which vary in PK for each ACT regimen, and for amodiaquine, a component of AS-AQ. Our group
has led critical PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies aimed at informing the optimized use of ACTs in the
most vulnerable populations for malaria, especially young children and those with HIV living in high
transmission settings. To ensure that antimalarial and antiretroviral therapy remain optimized in the current
shifting landscape, we propose to establish four longitudinal pediatric cohorts with the goal of 1) assessing the
impact of HIV/DTG and repeated malaria infection on weight gain and the development of metabolic
abnormalities in Ugandan children, 2) determining the PK of DTG and/or ACTs in HIV-uninfected children and
HIV-infected children and their bidirectional clinical impacts, and 3) determining whether ACT PK is a driver of
drug resistance selection. Our studies aim to ultimately inform guidelines on the appropriate management of
both HIV and malaria in pediatric populations in SSA during period of transition to DTG and emerging
artemisinin resistance."

This application proposes to adapt a Formerly Incarcerated Transitions (FIT) program for mostly African
American women, often with health disparities, who are released from incarceration and at high risk for HIV
acquisition. We propose to refer eligible incarcerated women for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a highly
effective biomedical prevention strategy. Our novel HIV prevention program, FIT for PrEP (F4P), will leverage
the infrastructure of a successful FIT program, revise and adapt it to link these at-risk women post- release to
PrEP services with adjunctive social services. Guided by the 5-steps of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention’s ADAPT framework (Assess, Select, Prepare, Pilot, Implement), F4P is modified specifically to
address the individual and structural barriers that women face during community re-entry preventing post-
release PrEP use. Previously, we completed steps 1 (Assess the target population’s needs) and 2 (Select the
intervention to adapt). This application targets step 3 (Prepare) by pre-testing and refining the intervention
to address the needs of the target population, and step 4 (Pilot) by testing the adapted intervention. We propose
to refine our novel F4P program, which increases access to HIV PrEP to women experiencing incarceration
(WEI). Peer Community Health Workers (CHW) with incarceration histories will begin meeting with WEI before
their release to provide PrEP education, needed social support, serve as role models, and link WEI to post-
release health care including PrEP. CHW will also address WEI’s social determinants of health during the
community re-entry period. We will refine our novel F4P program based upon feedback from WEI, CHWs, and
FIT clinicians using iterative Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. We plan to randomize sixty WEI
to either the F4P program or Stay Healthy cardiovascular prevention (attention) control arm and use quantitative
and qualitative approaches to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the F4P program. To gain preliminary
evidence for efficacy, PrEP initiation will be compared between the two groups at week 12 in aim 3. In
addition, the other PrEP care continuum steps will be measured to inform the future efficacy trial. The PI and Co-
I’s are experienced and have long-standing collaborations conducting research and implementing programs
within the NC women’s prison, FIT programs and NC community health centers. This application is both
innovative and highly significant because F4P expands the current HIV correctional prevention paradigm to
biomedical prevention (PrEP). F4P builds on the successful FIT model to target WEI, a high- risk yet
understudied US population. It strives to reduce health disparities among a socially and economically
marginalized group of African American women. The resulting data on F4P’s acceptability, feasibility, and
preliminary effect will inform a R01 application to evaluate the intervention’s efficacy in increasing WEI’s post-
release PrEP adherence and retention in care."

Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, and elevated intraocular
pressure (IOP) is the primary risk factor. By 2040, it is predicted that 112 million people worldwide will have
glaucoma. The IOP is maintained through a dynamic balance between the production and drainage of the
aqueous humor primarily via the trabecular meshwork (TM), juxtacanalicular connective tissue (JCT), and
Schlemm's canal (SC) endothelium of the conventional outflow pathway. Outflow tissues are hyperviscoelastic
(large-deformation and pressure-dependent) and dynamically interact with aqueous humor through an active,
two-way, fluid-structure interaction coupling. While glaucoma affects the morphology and mechanical properties
of the outflow tissues, the biomechanical and hydrodynamics states in glaucoma eyes are still largely unknown.
Assessment of the dynamic biomechanical properties of the TM, JCT, and inner wall endothelial cells of SC with
their basement membrane tissues in normal and disease will improve our understanding of the mechanisms of
IOP regulation and the dynamic outflow resistance and could be a target for new diagnostic and therapeutic
biomarkers in glaucoma. The goal of this project is to assess the biomechanical and hydrodynamic effects
of different drugs and treatments on outflow facility modulation through an inverse finite element method
coupled with an optimization algorithm and advanced OCT imaging data. In this project, the low-flow (LF)
and high-flow (HF) regions in human donor eyes will be determined by confocal imaging of the FluoSpheres in
the outflow pathway. Two-photon excitation microscopy will be used to measure the velocity of microbeads in
the TM while the SC is negatively pressurized. The TM/JCT/SC complex in the LF and HF regions will be
dissected and subject to tensile loading until failure. The elastic moduli of the normal and glaucomatous human
donor eyes in the LF and HF regions will be calculated. A quadrant of the anterior segment from normal and
glaucomatous human donor eyes in LF and HF regions will be positively and negatively pressurized and imaged
using a visible-light green OCT. The TM, JCT, SC inner wall boundaries in a course of dynamic motion will be
segmented using a deep neural network algorithm to reconstruct a finite element mesh of the TM, with the
adjacent JCT and the SC inner wall. A mesh-free, beam-in-solid material-modeling algorithm will be used to
distribute the collagen fibrils into the ECM of the TM and JCT. An inverse finite element method will be coupled
with an optimization algorithm to characterize the ECM/collagen fibrils hyperviscoelastic mechanical properties
in the LF and HF regions such that the TM, JCT, SC inner wall dynamic motion and OCT imaging data best
match over time. 3D finite element model of the TM/JCT/SC complex will be reconstructed using the OCT images
and will be subject to aqueous humor pressure elevation using fluid-structure interaction method. The
biomechanical and hydrodynamics of the outflow pathway will be modeled and validated versus the digital
volume correlation data (OCT images) and two-photon excitation microscopy/3D particle image velocimetry data."

postoperative pain, opioids remain the mainstay and most efficacious systemic pharmacologic therapy. However,
adequate age-specific pediatric pain treatment is limited by insufficient understanding of the dose-dependent
clinical effects of even widely available opioid analgesics. Every day, anesthesiologists and surgeons who care
for children are forced to navigate these knowledge gaps – to ensure adequate pain relief while balancing
concerns for opioid side effects and harms, patient and parental satisfaction, adherence to practice guidelines,
and compliance with legislative statutes that restrict opioid prescribing. The challenge to determine the optimal
analgesic regimen after pediatric surgery is particularly critical for the 500,000 children who undergo
tonsillectomy annually. Tonsillectomy is the most common painful elective procedure in children, yet analgesic
management after surgery remains inadequate, insufficient, and without consensus. Specifically, opioid
prescribing practices after tonsillectomy are highly variable, largely dependent on individual surgeons, and
susceptible to both over- and under-prescribing in an era when opioids have become a major public health
concern. We must do better. A recent paradigm shift in perioperative opioid use in adult surgical patients – the
use of long-acting (methadone) over short-acting opioids – has successfully diminished acute and chronic
postoperative pain and enabled less post-discharge opioid prescribing. Methadone, and its superior
pharmacologic properties, fulfills the therapeutic goal to better match the duration of analgesia to duration of
pain. Nonetheless, despite well-established benefits as a highly effective perioperative analgesic in adults,
methadone use to treat surgical pain in children has been limited to major inpatient procedures and hampered
by the lack of robust clinical data. Our proposal will address the urgent need to determine the optimal age-
specific, weight-based dose of intraoperative methadone for outpatient tonsillectomy in children in order to
improve analgesic outcomes and decrease the need for postoperative take-home opioids. We propose a single
center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-finding trial of single-dose intraoperative intravenous (IV)
methadone compared with short-acting opioids in 396 children in three age-matched cohorts. We will 1)
determine the optimal age-specific intraoperative dose of IV methadone in pediatric tonsillectomy that results in
less postoperative pain and opioid use compared with short-acting opioids, and 2) assess the impact of long-
versus short-acting intraoperative opioid on post-tonsillectomy recovery outcomes. After study completion, we
expect to have enriched the understanding of pediatric methadone pharmacology, improved analgesic outcomes
in a population of children and adolescents with acute surgical pain, enabled reduced postoperative opioid
prescribing, and achieved safer and more effective pediatric precision medicine."

End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) affects a significant number of patients in the U.S. (>785,000 in 2018), and
presents substantial medical, social, and economic challenges. Kidney transplantation is the preferred
treatment for ESKD. However, there is a pressing unmet clinical need for better methods that allow for
noninvasive, accurate, and frequent characterization and monitoring of kidney allograft injury. Such methods
are critical for enhancing long-term allograft survival and improving the quality of life for the kidney transplant
recipients. The change of kidney parenchymal microvasculature and perfusion has been shown to play a vital
role in the progression of allograft injury, while noninvasive tools for imaging and quantification of allograft
microvasculature are still lacking. In this project, we will develop a novel noninvasive, robust, and translatable
super-resolution ultrasound imaging (SRUI) technology. This technology aims to provide imaging and
quantification of parenchymal microvasculature to enable reliable assessment of allograft injuries. In our pilot
patient study of transplant kidneys, parameters derived from SRUI correlate strongly with pathology (r ≥ 0.9).
Aim 1: Technical development. We will advance and optimize the novel SRUI technology for kidney allograft
imaging and quantification. New signal enhancement and localization methods will be developed to improve
the overall performance of SRUI in clinical settings. We will advance the SRUI to 3D to enable more
comprehensive assessments of the graft microvasculature. We will develop novel quantitative SRUI metrics,
including microvascular density, tortuosity, flow speed, cortex perfusion and micro-resistive index.
Aim 2: Clinical patient study. We will study 158 patients to investigate the value of SRUI for kidney allograft
assessment using biopsy histology as validation. The association of SRUI metrics with histological injuries will
be assessed. The ability of SRUI, conventional ultrasound, and clinical measures (eGFR, proteinuria) to
distinguish between kidney allografts with varying degrees of histological injuries will be evaluated. We will also
assess the inter-sonographer reproducibility of the SRUI technology in a subset of 46 patients.
Aim 3: Longitudinal follow-up study. We will conduct a longitudinal follow-up study in 62 patients to assess
the efficacy of SRUI in monitoring and predicting the progression of allograft injury, using biopsy histology as
validation. The association of changes in SRUI metrics with the changes in histological injuries from 1-year to
2-year post-transplant will be assessed. We will study if SRUI metrics or combined metrics at 1-year post-
transplant, or the changes of these metrics from 1-year to 2-year, can distinguish between allografts without
and with histological worsening during this period.
Successful completion of this project will lead to a noninvasive, accessible, cost-effective, and translatable tool
to address the critical clinical need for reliable and frequent characterization of allograft in transplant recipients."

Over the last decade mouse models have become a mainstay of translational polycystic kidney disease (PKD)
research and vital to investigators around the world. Mouse models have been used to establish the molecular
and cellular basis of PKD, to identify therapeutic targets and to validate treatment targets in vivo. The overarching
goal of the Mouse Models and Biobank Core (MMBC) is to dismantle barriers for investigators seeking to use
PKD mouse models in their research. The MMBC will facilitate PKD research by distributing and maintaining
PKD mouse models and reagents, by sharing expertise and by performing and/or providing assistance with
preclinical trials in mice using standardized protocols. In addition, the MMBC will develop innovative mouse
models that can be used to understand disease pathogenesis and to test new classes of therapeutic agents. To
achieve these goals we propose the following aims: 1) Provide the research community with a genetically
engineered live mouse bio-resource 2) Generate and maintain a repository of murine biospecimens 3) Assist in
preclinical testing of promising candidate therapies using appropriate PKD models 4) Provide personalized
consultation and tools for investigators who use PKD mouse models in their research and 5) Generate and
distribute a novel Pkd2 mouse model that can be used for pre-clinical testing of agents that target defective
channel processing and/or function. In summary, completion of these aims will allow the Mouse Models and
Biobank Core to assist a diverse community of investigators in conducting high quality research using state-of-
the-art mouse models thereby accelerating discovery in the field of polycystic kidney disease."

This new proposed Core will support the work of the “Collaborative for Innovation in Data & Measurement in
Aging” (CIDMA) a collaboration of researchers at the University of Chicago (UChicago) Center for Healthy Ag-
ing Behaviors and Longitudinal InvestigationS (CHABLIS)and the Duke Center for Population Health and Aging
(CPHA). This Collaborative Core will identify, design, conduct and assess innovations in data collection and
measurement for use in current and future data-focused studies of aging. These innovations in data collection
and measurement will be focused on the following issues: (a) adapting methods for measuring cognition and
brain functioning from laboratory to field settings; (b) extending place-based studies of activities of individuals
and their consequences for health and well-being from urban to rural settings; and (c) assessing ways to im-
prove the collection of survey data and data from health records in both hospital- and population-based set-
tings, with special emphasis on developing methods to improve subject recruitment and retention and the use
of adaptive consenting processes to establish trust. The assessments conducted by CIDMA will have rapid
turnaround, from design to dissemination of its findings (thus, we refer to them as Rapid Assessments). These
Rapid Assessments will be focused on developing measures and methods that are cost-effective and that can
be implemented in a range of settings, especially those “in the field” for population-based studies. The mem-
bers of CIDMA will work collaboratively on these tasks, drawing on both their particular expertise and experi-
ence in data collection in studies of aging. This Core also will disseminate and educate the research commu-
nity on its findings. It will maintain an on-going dissemination effort of its findings and create a dialogue be-
tween researchers and survey operations professionals, and their application to existing and future studies.
This Core also will conduct two summer institutes and an end-of-project symposium/workshop to train and edu-
cate the next generation of researchers and data collection professionals in the study of aging.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, and its association with type 2 diabetes is
well established. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this link are not fully understood.
Hyperglycemia and dysregulated glucose metabolism have been suggested as factors contributing to the
increased risk of AD. This project aims to investigate the role of glycated tau and advanced glycation end
products (AGEs) in AD pathology, neurotoxicity, aggregation, and neuroinflammation. The proposed research
will pursue the following aims: Aim 1: Investigate how tau proteoforms with specific saccharide modifications
control aggregation and neurotoxicity. Aim 2: Expand in vitro studies to other reactive dicarbonyl species
operating through a mechanism similar to glycation. Aim 3: Evaluate the effects of glycation, AGE structure,
and attachment of DOPEGAL on interneuronal transmission, inflammation, and mitochondrial
dysfunction/oxidative stress. These studies will use hiPSC-derived models and will be accompanied by
extensive biophysical and biochemical characterizations to develop a molecular understanding of the role of
non-enzymatic post-translational modifications in AD. Successful completion of these aims will enable a more
precise diagnosis of AD and can potentially lead to novel therapeutic approaches based on the perturbation of
non-enzymatic modifications of tau and other proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, this
research will provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of AD and may lead to the
development of new treatments for this devastating disease."

 Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin; a highly aggressive
cancer with a 40% 2-year mortality rate. While the incidence of MCC is 25-fold less frequent than melanoma, it
is 13-fold more likely to cause death. In a remarkably short time, MCC has gone from an unknown cancer to
the poster child for the success of checkpoint blockade therapy (CBT). With the application of powerful new
tools to the study of MCC, it can be expected that the next 7 years will continue to bring remarkable new
discoveries with the potential to increase our insight not only into this cancer but into many other cancers as
well. There are two forms of MCC with different etiologies but nearly identical presentations. Virus-negative
(VN) MCC is caused by excessive sunlight exposure resulting in ultraviolet (UV) induced damage to the
genome, a pattern typical for other skin cancers including melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell
carcinoma. In contrast, virus-positive (VP) MCC is caused by integration of the MCPyV viral DNA into the host
cell genome with expression of a truncated form of Large T antigen (LT) and an intact Small T antigen (ST).
 Despite the near identical phenotypes, VN-MCC and VP-MCC have striking differences in their overall
genome mutation rate. The VN-MCC has a much higher tumor mutational burden (TMB, median ~ 40
mutations/mB) than VP-MCC (median 2/mB). VN-MCC has near universal inactivation of the RB1 and TP53
tumor suppressor genes as well as in the lysine methyl transferase genes KMT2C and KMT2D (also known as
MLL3 and MLL4). In addition, VN-MCC frequently contains amplification of MYCL or MYC. In contrast, VP-
MCC can be recognized by the presence of integrated MCPyV genomes, the absence of UV mutation
signature, a low TMB, and few if any mutations. Instead, VP-MCC expresses MCPyV LT that functionally
inactivates RB while ST recruits MYCL to the EP400 chromatin modifying complex to induce profound changes
in gene expressions.
 These distinctions between VP-MCC and VN-MCC raises the question of what we can learn about each
form of MCC that can inform us about the other. We propose that the distinct mechanisms of oncogenesis in
VN-MCC and VP-MCC provides us with the unique opportunity to use orthogonal methodologies to gain a
clearer insight into MCC. We propose that expression of MCPyV LT and ST is capable of inducing the relevant
phenotypic changes observed in VP-MCC that occur through the inactivating mutations of RB1, TP53, and
KMT2C/D genes and amplification of MYCL in VN-MCC. Our cancer program has made remarkable progress
in distinguishing between VN-MCC and VP-MCC and is now poised to exploit this opportunity to leverage
insights gained from each type of MCC to inform the other that will lead to significant insights into this disease.
Furthermore, we expect that these insights will provide useful insights into the oncogenic pathways that
contribute to other cancer types."
10882991,"Hedgehog Signal Transduction from the Cell Surface to the Nucleus during Vertebrate Eye Development
The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is essential for eye development, controlling a diverse array of fundamental
patterning, morphogenesis, and differentiation events during oculogenesis. Misregulated Hh signaling instigates
a spectrum of human developmental eye disorders, including holoprosencephaly, cyclopia, uveal coloboma and
retinal dystrophy. This signaling pathway is therefore a prime therapeutic target for eye development disorders
and for regenerative medicine efforts. During Hh signal transduction, the cell surface atypical G protein-coupled
receptor (GPCR) SMOOTHENED (SMO) communicates with GLI transcription factors in the nucleus, via a
mechanism that has remained enigmatic for decades. We recently found that SMO directly binds to the catalytic
subunit of protein kinase A (PKAcat) and physically blocks its enzymatic activity. As a result, PKAcat cannot
phosphorylate and inhibit GLI, leading to GLI activation. Thus, our work highlights two potential routes –
traditional G protein coupling and our new direct PKAcat inhibition pathway – for Hh signal transduction from the
cell surface to the nucleus during oculogenesis. How these two pathways regulate different stages of eye
development, and how to target each of them optimally for therapeutic purposes, remains largely unknown. We
hypothesize that SMO controls eye development by deploying the G protein coupling and PKA-binding pathways
in a spatiotemporally distinct manner. Here we propose to combine organoid, and animal models, along with
protein structure approaches, to uncover how SMO orchestrates eye development. We will: (1) learn how the
SMO G protein coupling and PKA-binding pathways controls retinal development, using human retinal organoid
development and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) differentiation as outputs for Hh pathway-dependent signaling
processes in the human retina; (2) assess the impact of each SMO-dependent pathway on ocular Hh signaling
in a whole animal context, using zebrafish to define the spatiotemporal contributions of each SMO-dependent
pathway to optic fissure formation and RGC differentiation in vivo; (3) solve the structure of a vertebrate SMO /
PKAcat complex using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, to learn how SMO engages PKAcat at
the atomic level, enabling precise manipulation of this interaction for therapeutic purposes. To carry out the
proposed studies, we have assembled a team of experts in biochemical / cell biological mechanisms of Hh signal
transduction (Myers), structure / biophysics of PKA (Taylor), human cellular and organoid retina models (Wahlin),
and zebrafish eye development (Kwan). The knowledge gleaned from our work will be vital in the development
of therapeutics for a range of debilitating eye disorders, as well as for production of specific ocular cell types in
regenerative medicine. It will also foster the development of drugs that selectively modulate either the SMO-G
protein or SMO / PKAcat signaling pathways, enabling more precise generation of desired ocular cell types for
regenerative medicine and more effective treatments for ocular conditions in the future."

10882158,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Older adults ≥75 years represent the fastest-growing population to initiate dialysis in the US. These people
face challenges in decision-making around dialysis initiation. They have reported that clinicians seldom elicit
treatment preferences, discuss prognoses, or explain the tradeoffs of kidney therapy (KT) options. Older
patients often prioritize the quality of life over life prolongation. However, dialysis is still commonly presented as
the sole KT option without any discussion of conservative kidney management or the effects of dialysis on the
future quality of life. Subsequently, many of these patients experience deterioration in quality of life, experience
high healthcare utilization rates, and undergo intensive end-of-life (EOL) treatments. Indeed, KT decision-
making requires the engagement of patients and physicians alike—incorporation of patients' goals, discussion
of alternatives to dialysis such as conservative kidney management (CKM), conversation about prognosis and
exploration of patients' emotional needs. The proposed study is a type-1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation
trial of a palliative care (CKD-EDU) intervention for patients ≥75 years old (n=326) with an estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. Patients in the intervention group will receive 1) a
multicomponent video and paper KT decision aid including a question prompt list, and 2) coaching from a
palliative care clinician. The visits will be used to explore patients' goals, address KT information needs
including prognosis, and attend to their emotions to aid them with KT and EOL decision-making. Patients in the
Control Group will receive the usual care from their nephrologist and a dialysis educator.
Aim 1: To determine whether CKD-EDU improves the kidney therapy decision-making process (primary) as
measured by the Decisional Conflict Scale at month 1 and enhances patient well-being (secondary) as
measured by the Burden of Kidney Disease Subscale at month 6.
Aim 2 (secondary): To determine whether the intervention reduces six-month health services utilization and
improves end-of-life care course during the last 30 days of life.
Aim 3 (exploratory): Identify barriers and facilitators to the dissemination and implementation of CKD-EDU
using rapid qualitative inquiry with key stakeholders (e.g., patients, caregivers, nephrologists and palliative care
clinicians)."
10882228,"This project examines the novel hypothesis that patent foramen ovale (PFO) induces neurovascular sequelae that may lead to vascular contribution to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). PFO, a connection between the right and left cardiac atria present in one out of four normal individuals, is known to cause stroke by allowing venous clots to travel directly to the brain. We have found that PFO is not just a door to allow clots through, but that PFO right-to-left shunting can also alter blood biochemistry in ways that are injurious to the brain vasculature, potentially increasing the risk of white-matter disease (WMD) and VCID.
We previously focused on the clinical endpoint of recurrent stroke. We now propose to study the new long-term outcome of vascular cognitive impairment, and to conduct novel complementary in vitro and clinical CSF/blood studies to advance the mechanism of shunting-related brain injury as a foundation for future intervention. We are grateful for prior critiques that found the study “innovative,” “extremely productive,” and viewed our translational/clinical approach to probe long term vascular cognitive impairment as a strength. In response, we have extensively revised and strengthened this resubmission with the addition of new aims and preliminary data, revised approach, and provided in-depth analysis and new publications as advised.
To investigate whether PFO is indeed a novel risk factor for VCID, building on the foundation of a well characterized and prospectively enrolled cohort complete with biomarkers/omics and cognitive data over more than a decade, we will use a combined clinical translational approach to: 1) understand how our newly- discovered PFO shunting state contributes to VCID over the long term, via subclinical ischemia as noted by WMD and clinical measures of cognitive impairment, as well as recurrent stroke. 2) Investigate mechanisms of novel shunt markers in vitro to better understand their contribution to white-matter dysfunction in the oligovascular niche, where crosstalk between oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and brain endothelium is vital to the BBB and the integrity of white matter health, whose disruption contributes to AD/ADRD; 3) Investigate clinical blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels and functions of PFO shunt markers with respect to mechanisms of BBB permeability to understand the impact of these markers on cognitive impairment.
Ultimately, the project aims to advance the scientific understanding VCID by investigating the mechanisms of PFO physiology, not only for high risk patients excluded from PFO trials, but also as a novel risk factor for long term development of cognitive impairment, to individualize future treatment and preventive strategies."
10880966,"A. Specific Aims 
Identification of high-risk populations suitable for screening and chemoprevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been proposed as an effective and efficient strategy to impact HCC-related mortality. Screening and earlier detection of HCC has had some impact on HCC mortality. However, the absence of tools to accurately predict which patients will progress to HCC remains a significant barrier to development of effective chemoprevention agents. Progress in prediction of who will progress to HCC and whether chemoprevention is likely to be effective would have a major clinical impact. 
Liver fibrosis is a common pathway shared by all progressive chronic liver diseases that raise risk for HCC, regardless of the underlying etiologies. Many lines of evidence suggest that increased fibrosis and fibrogenesis are independent predictors of HCC transformation, and that reducing liver fibrosis reduces HCC risk. Our lab has developed molecular probes for noninvasive, quantitative imaging of liver fibrosis and fibrogenesis throughout the entire liver. With a type I collagen targeted peptide-based MR probe we showed that we could accurately stage liver fibrosis in 6 different rodent models. We developed a second type of probe in prior work funded by this grant: molecular MR probes that target the aldehyde-containing allysine residue on oxidized collagen and showed that we could specifically quantify fibrogenesis (fibrotic disease activity). In this Renewal, we propose to expand this toolbox further and develop a third novel probe that targets inflammation associated with fibrogenesis (IAF). This probe is based on the low relaxivity Fe2+-PyC3A chelate which is activated by rapid oxidation to high relaxivity Fe3+-PyC3A in the presence of peroxidases released during inflammation and which then binds to allysine residues that are present during fibrogenesis, retaining the probe and its high relaxivity signal at the site of IAF. We will deploy these three probes (fibrosis, fibrogenesis, IAF) to characterize the combinations of these biochemical features that best predict transformation to HCC in rat and mouse models. Next, we will use molecular MR for real-time monitoring of response to chemoprevention agents that have been proven effective in preclinical models, and to guide effective dosing. The overarching goal of this project is to leverage molecular imaging of fibrosis to accurately predict risk of progression to HCC, and real-time monitoring of efficacy of interventions that reduce the risk. 
Aim 1. Develop a turn-on molecular probe to detect fibrogenesis when it is associated with inflammation. 
1.1. Synthesize a small focused library of allysine-targeted, Fe2+-PyC3A probes 
1.2. Screen the probes for relaxivity in the presence/absence of peroxidase, target affinity, non-specific binding, and allysine binding kinetics to a model proteiny 
1.3. Confirm the ability of the IAF probe to detect inflammation associated fibrogenesis in a mouse model of NASH/fibrosis/HCC (choline-deficient, l-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet and a single dose diethylnitrosamine (DEN) injection; DEN-CDAHFD) 
1.4. Demonstrate the specificity of the IAF probe for inflammation with fibrogenesis compared to fibrosis with minimal inflammation in rat diethylnitrosamine (DEN) models of acute inflammation. 
Aim 2. Define which combination of total liver collagen, liver fibrogenesis, and IAF assessed early in the course of disease by molecular MRI is predictive of worse disease progression 
2.1. Image DEN-CDAHFD mice with moderate or severe liver fibrosis using CM-101 (collagen targeted probe), Gd-1,4 (fibrogenesis probe), and the AIF probe from Aim 1 and then follow these animals and determine which animals develop HCC. Compare the accuracy of the three molecular MR methods performed early in the course of disease to predict worse disease progression and to predict HCC transformation. 
Aim 3. Demonstrate that molecular MR can provide an accurate assessment of efficacy of antifibrotic therapy and that molecular MR can predict the outcome of a chemoprevention intervention. 
3.1. Image DEN rats with Gd-1,4 and the IAF probe two weeks after initiating erlotinib or vehicle treatment and compare the early molecular MR readouts with the amount of liver fibrosis at the end of treatment determined by CM-101 MR imaging, biochemical analysis, and histopathology. 
3.2. Perform a dose response study with erlotinib in DEN rats and perform molecular MR two weeks after initiating treatment and then follow animals to measure HCC transformation histologically. We expect that disease activity at two weeks assessed by molecular MR will predict treatment efficacy and the minimally effective dose of erlotinib."
10871190,"Haplotype assembly is the problem of reconstructing the combination of alleles on the maternally and
paternally inherited chromosome copies and is key to our understanding of human population genetics and
disease. Numerous statistical and molecular approaches have been developed to date to enable haplotype
reconstruction. In this work, we focus on read-based phasing of individual genomes, which involves the
assembly of the two haplotypes from whole-genome-sequencing read alignments and variant genotypes.
Fragments that span more than one heterozygous variant provide molecular linkage evidence for alleles
occurring on the same haplotype and can hence be leveraged for haplotype assembly; however, sequencing
errors make this problem challenging. Existing techniques often employ an NP-hard combinatorial optimization
formulation for this problem and rely on hand-engineered heuristics to find a solution. Here we propose a novel
framework based on deep reinforcement learning, which integrates the representational power of deep
learning with reinforcement learning, to automatically learn effective algorithms that can accurately partition
read fragments into two haplotype sets given inputs from different sequencing platforms. Importantly, this
approach does not require labeled training data, which allows us to use all the publicly-available datasets
collected in large-scale sequencing repositories, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, as training data for our
models. Given the complex combinatorial structure of genomic data, an important aspect of this work is the
design and compilation of a representative training dataset to ensure model generalizability. Our initial
preliminary results show that our approach can achieve state of the art phasing block lengths and lower error
rates on short read inputs."

Despite more than one in five children in South Africa being HIV exposed uninfected (HEU), there are no
systems in South Africa to evaluate in a sustainable long-term manner the outcomes of children exposed to
HIV and antiretroviral drugs in utero. Through rigorous observational epidemiologic and modern biostatistical
methods, the CHERISH study (Children HIV Exposed Uninfected Research to Inform Survival and Health)
presents an opportunity to determine whether at a population and individual level survival, hospitalization,
growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes are equivalent in children who are HEU and children who are HIV
unexposed uninfected (HUU) in the era of universal maternal antiretroviral therapy. In the Western Cape
Province of South Africa, where maternal antenatal HIV prevalence is 19%, the Western Cape Provincial
Health Data Center curates electronic individual-linked health data from multiple sources according to unique
patient identifiers with routine birth linkage of maternal and infant unique identifiers. We will leverage this
resource and build on existing NIH investments in the Western Cape to establish a Western Cape province-
wide cohort of births from 2018-2024 (R61 ±360,000; R33 ±585,000), in synchrony with two sentinel-sites (R61
±36,000; R33 ±58,500), a static detailed cohort (R61 & R33 ±450) and dynamic light-touch cohort (R61 ±450;
R33 ±1,800). Specifically we propose during the R61 to establish and optimize sustainable measurement
of key in utero and postnatal exposures and outcomes in children who are HEU and HUU in the Western Cape
at 4 levels: province-wide population cohort; urban and rural sentinel sites (supported by NIH funding until
2020, to be expanded through CHERISH); static detailed urban cohort (NICHD-funded B-Positive cohort,
follow-up to be extended through CHERISH); dynamic light-touch urban and rural cohorts (to be newly
established by CHERISH). During the R33 we will harness these cohorts to pursue three scientific aims: to
compare 1) infant and under 3-year survival, 2) infant and under 3-year all-cause and infectious-cause
hospitalization and 3) growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 3-5 years in children who are HEU
and HUU; Furthermore, for each aim we will identify factors amenable to intervention that mediate the effects
of HIV and ARV exposure on survival, hospitalization, growth and neurodevelopment. The province-wide
cohort will inform the population-level impact of HIV/ARV-exposure on child survival and morbidity in children
who are HEU compared to HUU with similar socioeconomic, nutritional and environmental constraints to health
in an HIV high-prevalence setting. The sentinel-site, static and dynamic cohorts will apply advanced statistical
methods to identify causal pathways and sub-groups of children who are HEU with survival and morbidity
disparities to inform design of targeted interventions feasible for health systems in HIV high prevalence
settings. This presents a sustainable, innovative and adequately sized cohort model that with modest ongoing
investment can continue to accumulate mother-child pairs with lifelong follow-up and opportunities to evaluate
changes in in utero exposure to HIV and its prevention and treatment modalities as the epidemic evolves."

There has been an increase in the number of thyroid cancer survivors due to the rise in thyroid cancer
incidence and young age at diagnosis. Although a substantial proportion of these survivors were likely cured
with initial treatment, due to limited data and subsequent inability of physicians to confidently risk-stratify,
surveillance for recurrence continues for many years, often lifelong. Unnecessary surveillance results in
cancer-related worry, additional testing leading to false positive test results, and in some instances,
complications from additional treatments. Through our collaboration with SEER sites Georgia (includes Atlanta,
Greater Georgia, Rural Georgia) and Los Angeles County, we will have access to diverse, population-based
cohorts of patients, in whom we can determine recurrence risk as well as current and optimal long-term
surveillance. Our multipronged data collection strategy will allow us to obtain recurrence details from pathology
reports, augmented with mortality data, patient report, and physician chart review and reporting. External
validation will occur with use of the comprehensive University of Michigan Precision Health data. We will
determine characteristics of cohorts at lower and higher risk of cancer recurrence, use these data to inform
more tailored surveillance care pathways, and then refine surveillance care pathways after assessing trade-
offs and net benefit. The ability to categorize thyroid cancer survivors into meaningful recurrence risk-stratified
groups, tailor surveillance care pathways to recurrence risk, and then refine surveillance care pathways after
assessing trade-offs will inform appropriate long-term follow-up, reduce patient harm, and improve healthcare
costs. This study will dramatically change the care of thyroid cancer patients and will serve as a model for risk-
stratified surveillance for other cancer types."

10874423,"The goal of the Pilot & Feasibility and Named New Investigator (P&F-NNI) Program in the UAB
Nutrition and Obesity Research Center (NORC) is to foster an environment for the development
and testing of new research ideas in nutrition- and obesity-related research. These new concepts
may not just come from within the current NORC community, but also from non-NORC
investigators across schools throughout UAB’s campus who bring new ideas and hypotheses and
eventually become NORC members. Selection of projects to be funded by NORC is a two-step
process. In the first step, the opportunity for funding is advertised using all possible mechanisms
(on the NORC website; flyers throughout campus; in the UAB eReporter [an electronic newspaper
distributed to the entire campus community]; and email dissemination through Deans, Chairs, and
Directors of University-wide Research Centers, including the Center for Clinical and Translational
Science [CCTS; i.e., UAB’s CTSA]). Emphasis is placed on funding junior investigators, but senior
investigators who have not previously been funded for nutrition- and obesity-related research are
also eligible to apply. Submitted abstracts (approximately 500 words) are reviewed by the P&F
Program directors and the NORC senior leadership to identify which are most meritorious and
which would utilize NORC Cores. Those who have submitted the top-rated abstracts are then
invited to submit a full application. Once received, these applications are reviewed and scored
extramurally (using the NIH review scoring scheme) by experts in the field. The scores and the
written reviews are then considered by the P&F Program directors and the senior NORC
leadership. P&F Program awardees not only receive funding, but also mentoring, administrative
support, and grantsmanship advice to maximize the possibility of subsequent extramural funding
of the projects. In doing so, the P&F Program directors provide oversight and monitoring to ensure
that any administrative or science-related barriers are overcome. In the unlikely event that a
project encounters insurmountable difficulty, the project may be terminated. Ultimately awardees
are required to present the results of their study at the NORC Scientific Seminar. In conclusion,
the P&F-NNI Program is focused on enabling paradigm shifts in the field of nutrition and obesity
research leading to new and more effective strategies for the prevention and/or treatment of
nutrition-related disorders, most especially obesity."
10876786,"Project Summary: Sugary drinks are the largest single source of calories in the US diet and contribute
approximately 8% and 7% of total energy intake for US youth and adults, respectively. Unfortunately, the
prevalence of daily sugary drink intake is significantly higher in nonmetropolitan US counties, relative to
metropolitan counties (adjusted prevalence ratio = 1.32). Also, an estimated 47% of children age 2-5 consume
sugary drinks daily. High sugary drink intake contributes to the development of numerous chronic conditions,
including cancer. Despite convincing data on risky sugary drink behaviors in rural counties and among
preschool-aged children, there are substantial gaps in the intervention literature. For example, few sugary drink
interventions have targeted the needs of US rural regions, few have effectively used scalable technology to
reduce child’s sugary drinks, and most fail to report on external validity factors. Our application addresses
these needs and builds on our team’s extensive digital Health expertise and successful sugary drink research
within rural communities. We target Head Starts across defined rural areas (i.e., RUCC 4-9) in Appalachia and
the southern Black Belt. Our proposed intervention targets parents as the agent of change and aims to improve
parent-child dyad outcomes. Phase 1 is guided by the Adaptome framework. In partnership with rural Head
Start staff and parents, we will apply a user-centered design process to adapt our existing evidence-based
sugary drink interventions to a digital intervention. This new program, called weSIPsmarter, will be a highly
interactive, structured program consisting of multiple evidence-based behavioral change components,
including use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to encourage self-monitoring of beverage behaviors
and parenting feeding practices, action planning, a resource help line, and drinking water vouchers for families
with concerns related to in-home tap water quality. Phase 2 is guided by RE-AIM and includes a 2 group
cluster RCT design [weSIPsmarter vs. control] with 3 assessment (pre, 9-week post, and 12-month follow-up)
periods. We propose to randomize 12 Head Start center clusters with an average of 31 parent-child dyads per
cluster (total of 372 parent-child dyads). We hypothesize that weSIPsmarter will be more efficacious at
reducing sugary drink consumption than control. Changes in secondary outcomes will also be evaluated,
including parent-child dyad outcomes (e.g., diet quality, water, BMI, QOL, behavioral theory constructs) and
maintenance at 12-months post intervention. Additional secondary aims include to examine reach, describe
parent engagement, and apply a mixed-methods process evaluation to evaluate adoption and implementation
among Head Starts. We also aim to explore mediators and moderators (e.g., social determinant of health
indicators) to engagement and efficacy outcomes and to explore organizational-level maintenance. The long-
term goal of this primary prevention research is to develop an efficacious sugary drink reduction intervention
that has high reach among rural, low socioeconomic, children ages 2-5 and their parents."
10883160,"Recurrent metastasis is the leading cause of breast cancer mortality. Dormancy is a critical, but poorly
understood, step in the tumorigenic process where breast cancer cells can remain in a non-proliferative state at
secondary sites for long periods of time after successful treatment of the primary tumor. Reactivation of dormant
breast cancer cells (dDCCs) enables recurrent metastatic disease often resistant to standard of care therapies,
and as such dDCCs represent a major clinical obstacle in breast cancer patient care. Chromatin remodeling
provides the foundation for the cellular reprogramming necessary to drive cell fate transitions. However, little is
known about the nature of this remodeling in the context of dormancy. Our published work demonstrated that as
breast cancers acquire the ability to disseminate, canonical histone H3 incorporation into chromatin is
suppressed and replaced by a rare histone H3 variant, H3.3, incorporated by its cognate histone chaperone,
HIRA. This switch in histone composition is sufficient and necessary to enable dissemination and consequently
promote breast cancer metastasis. Our subsequent studies revealed that HIRA is not only important for acquiring
metastatic ability within the primary tumor but also for controlling the transition between dormant and proliferative
states, thereby serving as a major regulator for the fate of DCCs. Thus, here we propose that H3.3 deposition
driven by the HIRA complex regulates breast DCCs’ fate through the metastatic cascade, determining whether
the cells enter and remain dormant or proliferate and form overt metastases. This hypothesis will be tested
through three specific aims: Aim 1 will focus on establishing H3.3 deposition into chromatin as the effector of
HIRA in regulating the proliferation to dormancy switch in breast DCCs and the specific mechanism by which
HIRA-mediated H3.3 deposition exerts its effects while aim 2 will focus on precisely defining the inflection points
in the metastatic cascade regulated by HIRA-mediated H3.3 deposition and their metabolic/redox requirements.
Aim 3 on the other hand will focus on defining the role of the HIRA-H3.3 chromatin remodeling axis in mediating
the interaction between the lung environment and the fate of dormant cancer cells. Successful completion of
these studies will unveil for the first time a major regulator of the epigenetic remodeling that drives the
establishment of and exit from dormancy. Consequently, the proposed studies will put forward HIRA as an
important therapeutic target to prevent reawakening and consequently the active recurrence of metastatic breast
cancer. Moreover, our studies will enable the unbiased discovery of redox and metabolic pathways that support
vitality of the different cell states during the metastatic cascade enabling future studies aimed at evaluating said
pathways as much needed liabilities with therapeutic relevance to eradicate dormant cells and effectively prevent
recurrent metastatic breast cancer."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality has declined significantly over the past two decades, but there has been
a recent rise in CVD deaths among younger women (ages 35–54), for reasons yet unknown. The prevalence of
poor sleep has steadily increased and is more common among women. There is a growing body of compelling
evidence linking poor quality and short duration sleep to increased CVD risk. Poor sleep could be a potential
cause for the higher incidence of CVD-related deaths among younger women, yet the mechanisms are not
known. Women may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of poor sleep on cardiac health, as they face unique
sleep challenges at different life stages, including inadequate sleep in the childbearing and/or postpartum
periods, and sleep disturbances due to hormonal changes during the menopausal transition and post-
menopause. Women may also differentially experience psychosocial risk factors such as depression and
increased strain due to caregiving responsibilities, which have been linked to poor sleep and increased CVD
risk. Our preliminary data shows that short sleep duration and poor quality sleep are associated with CVD risk
factors among women, including obesity, blood pressure, and inflammation. A majority of women now report
irregular sleep, a high day-to-day variability in sleep duration and timing, as their habitual sleep pattern. Whereas
the association between short and long sleep duration and obesity, hypertension, and CVD has long been
recognized, irregular sleep has been mostly overlooked as a possible contributor to CVD. Sleep timing and
variability has also been disproportionately understudied in racial/ethnic minorities and women. Capitalizing on
our two racially and ethnically diverse cohorts of women that have been well-characterized for sleep patterns,
we propose to investigate variability in sleep timing as a potential new risk factor for CVD among women at two
planned follow-up time points. We will leverage the ongoing Go Red for Women community-based cohort study
of 506 women and the national Research Goes Red weight study cohort of 300 women to conduct analyses of
the link between objectively-measured variable sleep timing, a highly modifiable lifestyle behavior, and CVD risk
among women (Aim 1); determine if there are differences associated with ethnicity and menopausal status, and
if caregiving, stress, and depression may mediate the sleep irregularity-CVD risk association (Aim 1a); and
determine whether variable sleep is associated with low brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, a precursor to
CVD (Aim 2). Variable sleep timing may be an unrecognized contributor to increased CVD risk among women.
Variable sleep timing is a highly prevalent, easily modifiable behavior, that could be targeted in public health
campaigns to reduce the risk of CVD. Findings from our proposed data would inform the development of public
health guidelines and clinical recommendations addressing sleep schedules to optimize cardiovascular health,
thereby decreasing CVD morbidity and mortality and excess healthcare costs in a large and expanding segment
of women at risk."

 Dysfunction of the intestinal barrier established by tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)
is a critical issue for many diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases and mucositis as a severe
complication of chemotherapy. There is an unmet need in efficiently preventing dysfunction of the intestinal
barrier. Observational evidence suggests that oligosaccharides in human milk are associated with beneficial
effects in infancy and in adulthood. However, neither basic research nor clinical studies have revealed the exact
biological functions or mechanisms of action of individual oligosaccharides during development or in adulthood.
Thus, it remains largely unknown whether these oligosaccharides could become effective therapeutics. 2’-
fucosyllactose (2’-FL) is the most abundant oligosaccharide in human milk but are not present in dairy milk. We
have found a previously unrecognized role of 2’-FL in protecting intestinal barrier and ameliorating intestinal
injury during colitis and mucositis in adult mice. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated that dysregulated
microbial metabolic pathways in ulcerative colitis patients are regulated by 2-FL in adult mice. We have further
found that 2’-FL promotes Bifidobacterium infantis to produce metabolites, such as pantothenate that protects
the intestinal barrier against oxidative stress. Another important finding is that 2’-FL directly stimulates
transactivation of a cell protective signaling, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in IECs.
 We will test the hypothesis that 2’-FL protects the intestinal barrier against injury during intestinal
inflammation in adulthood through two mechanisms: by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria capable of
metabolizing 2’-FL, and by stimulating transactivation of EGFR in IECs in a microbially-independent manner.
The mechanisms underlying protecting the mucosal barrier in intestinal inflammation by human gut microbiota
consuming 2’-FL will be defined in Aim 1. We will define the impact of 2’-FL on the adult human gut microbial
compositional balance, particularly growth of 2’-FL consuming bacteria, and metabolite production and determine
the exact roles of 2’-FL-regulated microbial profile and metabolites, such as pantothenate, in protecting the
intestinal barrier against injury in colitis and mucositis in adult mice. We will further identify 2’-FL-directed
pathways that mediate growth and metabolism in B. infantis and B. breve. In Aim 2, we will determine the
mechanisms by which 2’-FL directly stimulates cellular responses in IECs that ameliorate inflammation-induced
disruption of the intestinal barrier through identifying novel targets of 2’-FL in IECs, including targets for EGFR
activation, revealing protective cellular response through 2’-FL-stimulated EGFR signaling in IECs and further
define these cellular programs at single cell resolution in the human intestinal epithelium, and defining the
contribution of 2’-FL-stimulated EGFR signaling in IECs to preservation of the epithelial barrier and enhancement
of epithelial regeneration in colitis and mucositis in adult mice. Results from this proposal will support 2’-FL as
novel therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with impaired intestinal homeostasis."

Cancer evolution driven by DNA-mutating APOBEC enzymes (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic
polypeptide-like), and the emergence of resistance to therapy, present a pressing clinical challenge. In particular,
the APOBEC3A (A3A) enzyme is implicated in a range of cancers and is hypothesized to drive resistance to
targeted anticancer therapies. This project proposes to explore the mechanisms of A3A activity during targeted
therapy, its substrate preferences, and potential methods of inhibiting its activity to slow cancer evolution and
impede the emergence of drug resistance. Aim 1 focuses on investigating the role of A3A in the emergence of
drug resistance, hypothesizing that A3A expression is upregulated during targeted therapy, leading to APOBEC-
signature mutations. We will test this using lung cancer cell-line models and targeted therapies, and will use
CRISPR technology to genetically eliminate A3A and monitor the impact on the emergence of drug-resistant
cells. Aim 2 seeks to determine the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic targets of A3A and other APOBECs.
Our previous work suggests that APOBEC mutagenesis and RNA editing are directed by local and mesoscale
structural constraints. We will conduct computational analyses to identify hotspots of A3A activity in DNA and
RNA and their subsequent protein effects, refining our understanding of APOBEC mutagenesis and identifying
super-optimal A3A substrates. Aim 3 proposes to evaluate the efficacy of hairpins and hairpin-like molecules as
A3A inhibitors. We anticipate that A3A's affinity for hairpin substrates may render it susceptible to inhibition by
hairpins or hairpin-like molecules. Testing will be performed in vitro and in cells to assess whether hairpin
molecules can inhibit endogenous cellular A3A activity and slow drug resistance evolution. Through a
combination of computational and experimental approaches, this research will advance our understanding of
APOBEC mutagenesis, potentially offering novel diagnostics, research tools, and treatments for APOBEC-driven
cancers."

Our lab has made substantial strides in understanding how human genetic variation affects erythropoiesis and
fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels, both critical factors in conditions such as sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia,
as well as other forms of anemia. Utilizing cutting-edge genetic studies, we have mapped thousands of genetic
variants influencing red blood cell phenotypes and HbF levels. We have also functionalized these variants
through the use of innovative techniques such as massively parallel reporter assays and base editing in primary
human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that were developed with support we received over the past ten
years from this grant. In this competitive renewal application for this foundational grant, “Systematic Genetic
Dissection of Human Erythropoiesis,” we propose a deeper investigation into the genetic network regulating
human erythropoiesis and HbF expression. Specifically, we aim to 1) use massively parallel base editing to
pinpoint key nucleotide determinants of HbF-related regulatory elements; 2) chart high-resolution interaction
maps between these regulatory elements, their target genes, and other interactive genomic elements across
different stages of erythropoiesis; and 3) conduct multiplexed base editing of key transcription factors and
identified regulatory nucleotides to understand their genetic interactions. Our research will provide invaluable
insights into the intricate genetic mechanisms regulating erythropoiesis and HbF expression, potentially paving
the way for innovative therapeutic approaches for hemoglobinopathies. This project signifies a critical
foundational step in leveraging genetic knowledge for the development of clinical interventions in debilitating
hematological conditions."
10883331,"Project Summary
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the sixth most common epithelial cancer worldwide with 50,000 new
cases/year in US. Despite being less frequent, survival rates are relative lower. Clinically, OSCC presents as a
necrotic lesion with stiffened borders; surgical resection requires significant tissue loss up to 2 cm surround the
lesion, owing to the fact that these tumors are poorly margined and require significant resection to ensure all
metastatic disease is removed. Even with aggressive surgical approaches, significant morbidity and mortality is
associated with OSCC, and this dramatically reduces patient quality of life. While stiffened borders are a hallmark
of the disease, it is unclear to what extent microenvironmental properties, e.g., mechanical changes in
extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness, contribute to tumor progression and invasion. The role of stiffness has been
well established in other epithelial tumors, e.g., breast, but our understanding in OSCC is relatively nascent; less
than 10 studies have even peripherally addressed the issue. Preliminary data from our groups is the first to
demonstrate that a stiffer environment induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of oral epithelial cells
and that they adopt a more aggressive behavior of invasive OSCC (Matte et al 2019; Moon et al 2023). EMT of
these oral tissues might contribute to frequent tumor recurrence observed in patients with excessively stiff tumor
margins. Since OSCC is exceedingly invasive, learned behaviors within the stiffened tumor must be remembered
and recalled once in softer adjacent oral tissues to facilitate the establishment of secondary disease. Thus, we
hypothesize that tumor stiffness induces the acquisition and consolidation of mechanical memory, i.e., EMT and
migration, which can be recalled later when the resulting OSCC cells disseminate and contribute to tumor
metastasis, invasion, and recurrence. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Elucidate the mechanisms involved in mechanical sensing leading to “memory” acquisition and
recall
Specific Aim 2: Determine to what extent epigenetic changes in OSCC induce “memory” consolidation"
10883072,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Organelle deterioration is a common feature of aging, and contributes to a number of age-related diseases. A
major interest of my lab is to understand how organelles are functionally interconnected within cells, and uncover
mechanisms by which organelle dysfunction perturbs cellular homeostasis during aging. Our work in this area
during the previous project period focused on the lysosome (or vacuole in yeast), an acidic organelle that
functions in protein degradation as well as metabolite storage and signaling. Impaired lysosomal function is a
hallmark of aging across species and is a major contributor to age-related cellular dysfunction. Because many
pathways converge at the lysosome that rely on the acidification of the organelle, how perturbations in lysosome
acidity impact cell function has remained unclear. Answering this important question is a long-term goal of our
lab. In the previous project period, we employed budding yeast as a model system to interrogate how vacuole
dysfunction impacts cell health during aging, with a specific focus on dissecting the nature of its functional link
to another metabolic organelle, the mitochondrion. We found that the essential function of vacuoles in supporting
mitochondrial respiration is not linked to its well-known function in autophagy, but rather, it was tied to the role
of vacuoles in amino acid compartmentalization and storage. We found that cysteine, which is stored in vacuoles
in healthy cells, disrupts iron homeostasis when its vacuole compartmentation is perturbed during aging. Loss
of iron homeostasis in turn alters the function of mitochondria, as well as numerous other iron-dependent cellular
processes. Importantly, the connection between lysosome function, mitochondria, and iron homeostasis was
validated by two other groups in human cells. Altogether, these results raise a new hypothesis to explain how
loss of lysosome function causes age-related deterioration, and identify amino acids as potential drivers of
cellular decline during aging. In the next project period, we plan to build on this discovery and new preliminary
data by identifying pathways that coordinate with vacuoles to maintain amino acid homeostasis (Aim 1), and
dissecting cellular mechanisms of amino acid toxicity and their impact on cellular decline during aging (Aim 2).
The results of these studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of cellular pathways that
coordinate with vacuoles to maintain amino acid organization, and provide key insight into the degree to which
the 20 proteogenic amino acids act as toxic agents during aging when their organization is compromised."
10880847,"Project Summary
Skilled inter-limb coordination is critically important for performance of many activities of daily living (ADL). In
many patients with neurological disorders, such as stroke and cerebral palsy, impairments in bimanual
coordination are often functionally greater than impairment of the more affected limb. Therefore, improving our
understanding of neural mechanisms underlying bimanual control in typically-developed adults is critically
important as a stepping stone towards creating more effective and targeted clinical interventions. While most of
the existing bimanual research has focused on tasks in which each limb has independent goals, the proposed
research will investigate how the brain controls two limbs when they share a common goal. We will test the
hypothesis that cortical activity, in particular within the posterior parietal cortices (PPC), is differentially
modulated to support common-goal bimanual coordination when the limbs are subjected to variable constraints
and perturbations. We propose a series of experiments in which healthy adults will perform a virtual object
manipulation task with the actions of two limbs. We will systematically vary the symmetry of bimanual actions
in our virtual manipulation task by introducing persistent constraints or abrupt perturbations. These constraints
and perturbation challenge the central nervous system to correctly perform the common-goal bimanual
coordination. We expect greater performance error when the task is performed with constraints or
perturbations applied to one limb (asymmetric) than both limbs (symmetric). Therefore, this experimental
paradigm will enable us to quantify the behavioral changes of spatial-temporal inter-limb coordination in
response to these constraints and perturbations, and investigate the underlying cortical activities using
electroencephalography (EEG). Moreover, we will determine the causal role of bilateral intraparietal sulci (IPS)
in bimanual common-goal coordination using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a system
identification tool to induce reversible virtual lesions. We will deliver continuous theta burst TMS or high
intensity single pulse stimulation to medial IPS or a control region (i.e., anterior IPS) of either right or left
cerebral hemispheres, and quantify the resulting deficit in bimanual coordination. Our findings have potential
applications to translational research on sensorimotor rehabilitation to improve bimanual training paradigms in
stroke bilateral therapies (i.e., common-goal coordination), and guide the design of non-invasive brain
stimulation to enhance the outcome of these interventions. Our long-term goals are to (1) extend the
investigation of neural control of common-goal inter-limb coordination to a broader cortical network by
combining our unique experimental paradigm with functional magnetic resonance imaging, and (2) apply our
experimental approach to study coordination of bimanual movements in individuals affected by sensorimotor
deficits to design evidence-based, user-centered interventions."

Hypertension is the chief risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease and a major threat to population health.
Given the burden of hypertension, it is critical to identify risk enhancers in populations susceptible to CV
disease, for risk stratification. While family history of hypertension, especially parental hypertension, is well-
known as a robust predictor of high blood pressure (BP) and CV disease in the offspring, the role of chronic
sleep deficiency is being increasingly recognized. Evidence from epidemiological and laboratory-based
studies converges to indicate that insufficient sleep increases BP and alters CV disease mechanisms, thus
predisposing to adverse outcomes. Whether the detrimental impact of insufficient sleep on CV risk is
potentiated in populations with preexisting vulnerabilities, such as the offspring of hypertensive families, is
plausible yet unknown. To bridge this gap, we propose a randomized, controlled, crossover, 10-day
inpatient study to investigate whether experimental sleep restriction increases BP and impairs CV function
in individuals with a positive parental history of hypertension (+PHH), and whether the hypothesized
adverse impact of shortened sleep is greater in this group compared to individuals with a negative PHH
(−PHH). We propose the following Specific Aims comparing sleep restriction to normal sleep in the
offspring of hypertensive parents relative to the offspring of normotensive parents.
Aim 1. To compare the effects of sleep restriction on ambulatory BP in individuals with a +PHH compared
to those with a −PHH.
Aim 2. To determine the impact of sleep restriction on neural circulatory control and vascular function in
individuals with a +PHH compared to those with a −PHH.
Aim 3. To explore epigenetic and transcriptomic modifications in response to sleep restriction in individuals
with a +PHH compared to those with a −PHH.
This proposal builds upon important strengths, including an interdisciplinary team of investigators with
unique experience and expertise; supporting preliminary data; a robust study design which will ensure
rigorous and unbiased research; and integration of physiological, behavioral, and omics variables in a
translational framework. This mechanistic study will inform on the role of sleep deficiency as a CV risk
enhancer in individuals with familial predisposition to hypertension, and guide future preventative strategies
targeting sleep to ameliorate CV risk in vulnerable populations."
10880909,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a relentless disease characterized by vascular obliteration, right heart
failure and death. Although there are ten FDA-approved therapies in three classes for PAH, none is curative
and approximately 40% of patients are dead within 5 years of diagnosis. There is no established approach to
identify patients who will respond to a specific therapy. The goals of this proposal are to improve outcomes in
PAH using precision medicine concepts through an advanced genetics and “Omics” techniques. In unselected
PAH patients, there are two subsets with striking responses to therapy. One is a small subset that has a
marked reduction in PAH acutely in response to vasodilators and a dramatic long-term clinical response to
calcium channel blocker (CCB) therapy. We previously published that RNA expression patterns and DNA
variants in idiopathic PAH patients successfully identify patients that respond to CCB therapy. The second
subset is patients that have marked improvement with parenteral prostacyclin (PP) therapy. Presently, there is
little insight on how to select among the three FDA-approved PAH drug classes aside from clinical metrics of
disease severity and little understanding of how PP therapy improves PAH. The first funding cycle of this grant
has begun to address this unmet need by focusing on predicting responses to PP therapy. We have found two
potential genetic associations with prostacyclin response, one is a polygenic risk score and the other is a
variant in the complement 5 (C5) gene identified through a genome wide association study. Additionally, we
prospectively enrolled 40 patients with PAH initiating PP to detect molecular predictors of prostacyclin
response. In our early analysis, we have found changes in T cell phenotype in patients after PP, suggesting a
more “tolerant” immune phenotype after PP. Others have published an important role for T cells in promotion of
PAH, but the effect of PP therapy on T cell populations is unknown. This data was supported by a similar
pattern of cytokine amelioration with PP (reduced IL-17A, IL-5). We found that IFN concentration at initiation
could predict transplant-free survival, suggesting that these cytokines may be used to personalize treatment for
PAH. We and others have extensively studied metabolic dysfunction in PAH, but the reasons underlying this
phenomenon remain elusive. Here we found that in PAH patients requiring PP, plasma glucose directly
correlated with IL-17A levels in the plasma, suggesting a potential link between metabolic disease and immune
cell function in PAH. We hypothesize that immune phenotypes govern prostacyclin responses and are
associated with metabolic changes in PAH. We propose the following specific aims to test this hypothesis: (1)
Test the hypothesis that genomic phenotypes of prostacyclin response are common in all PAH subtypes, and
are associated with poorer transplant-free survival in subjects treated with prostacyclins. (2) Test the
hypothesis that inflammatory phenotype defines PAH prostacyclin response. (3) Test the hypothesis that PAH
immune phenotypes are associated with metabolic dysfunction and ameliorated with prostacyclin therapy."
10882677,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Disorganized electrical waves that produce complex arrhythmias in the heart are a
major health issue. According to the Center for Disease Control, an estimated 400,000-460,000 unexpected
sudden cardiac deaths occur every year in the US, in most cases due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Atrial
fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia; it contributes to 160,000 deaths
annually, and its prevalence is projected to increase from 5.2 million in 2010 to 12.1 million by 2030. The
primary defibrillation therapy for termination of VF and AF has significant side effects, including severe
pain and anxiety disorders from inappropriate firings along with myocardial damage from repeated shocks,
which can also lead to increased mortality. While there is no other reliable current cure for VF, AF can be
treated with radiofrequency ablation; however, its success rate for paroxysmal AF is only about 60%, and
for persistent AF it is even less effective at 30%. Thus, it is clear that there is a need for more effective
approaches to treat AF and VF.
 The ultimate goal of these studies is to develop a successful low-energy defibrillation protocol that
minimizes the energy requirements for suppression of VF and AF, to the point where such an approach
could be implemented reliably via an implantable device in ambulatory patients. Toward this end, the
project will utilize live explanted hearts from heart failure patients who receive new donor hearts, using
appropriate approvals. In this project, first the detailed dynamics of AF and VF in the explanted hearts will
be quantified, and advanced computational tools to simulate these arrhythmias in anatomically accurate
three-dimensional heart structures will be developed. Mathematical models of cardiac cells will be fitted to
experimental data to accurately reproduce the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of AF and VF in the
human heart. These models will be used in advanced computational tools to systematically study and
optimize the many parameters for low-energy defibrillation in simulations using machine learning
algorithms. Then, the defibrillation protocol will be tested and further optimized experimentally in the
explanted hearts and then with in vivo animal (swine) studies to investigate clinical translation. Throughout,
a state-of-the-art optical-mapping methodology will be used to visualize and record electrical activity to
characterize fibrillation and inform the mathematical models; similarly, the computational results will
inform low-energy defibrillation experiments in the explanted hearts. The use of explanted hearts not only
reduces the use of animals but sidesteps translational problems associated with studies in non-human
species, making the defibrillation studies proposed in this study as applicable to clinical settings as possible.
In the end, this project not only will lead to better cardioversion and defibrillation therapies with greater
reductions in pain, but also will fundamentally advance our mechanistic understanding of fibrillation."
10882025,"Summary
Glaucoma is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs) that can lead to visual impairment and blindness. Age, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), and genetics
are the main risk factors. In a search for neuroprotective factors, we identified astrocytic SPP1 (Secreted
phosphoprotein 1). SPP1 deletion increases vulnerability of RGCs to elevated IOP, while SPP1 overexpression
preserves RGC numbers and rescues visual function. Using a transgenic reporter/conditional Spp1 knock-out
strain we developed during a previous grant period, we found that in astrocytes, SPP1 promotes phagocytosis
and secretion of neurotrophic factors while inhibiting production of neurotoxic and pro-inflammatory factors.
Interestingly, SPP1 overexpression also significantly slows the RGC loss and visual function decline that occurs
during normal aging even in the absence of glaucoma.
To move SPP1 closer to a therapeutic use in humans, it is important to understand the mechanisms of action.
We found that in astrocytes SPP1 up-regulates transcription of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation,
functionally enhances mitochondrial respiration, and promotes the integrity of mitochondrial microstructure. One
of the top SPP1-responsive genes is Vdac1 (voltage-dependent anion channel 1), a protein in the outer
membrane of mitochondria that promotes ATP delivery from mitochondria into cytoplasm in astrocytes. One of
the goals of this application is therefore to test whether the neuroprotective activity of SPP1 is mediated by its
effect on mitochondrial function and Vdac1 expression. In addition to SPP1 expression in astrocytes, SPP1 is
also expressed in retinal alpha RGC (but not in other RGCs). Deletion of Spp1 from alpha RGCs leads to a
significantly worse outcome for all RGC survival, not just that of the alpha cells themselves. We hypothesize that
alpha RGCs, in addition to their function as retinal output neurons, also form part of a protective system and
secrete SPP1 for the benefit of neighboring (SPP1-negative) RGCs. We hypothesize that this effect is mediated
by microglia. Microglia activation is an important cause of RGC degeneration in glaucoma and our preliminary
data indicate that microglia from Spp1 knock-out retinas show stronger morphological signs of activation. In
response to increased IOP, microglia from Spp1-negative mice also express more inflammatory markers.
Finally, for therapeutic use, a small molecule that up-regulates the expression of SPP1 by astrocytes and alpha
RGCs may be more suitable than the protein itself. We identified several such molecules (e.g., retinoic acid,
thyroid hormone, and vitamin C). Though none of these is a likely candidate for a glaucoma therapy in humans,
these proof of principle experiments indicate that a more systematic search using a small molecule library is
promising. We will use astrocytes from our transgenic reporter/conditional knock-out strain to screen compound
libraries and validate the results in vitro, followed by in vivo experiments using a mouse model of glaucoma."
10884404,"Hepatic decompensation (overt ascites, encephalopathy and variceal hemorrhage) and mortality in patients with
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) increases exponentially with the development of cirrhosis. Prevention of
such liver-associated clinical events (LACE) is therefore a major goal of therapeutics. This requires identification
of those at risk and targeting them with effective therapeutics. Current approaches to identify this population
include the use of fibrosis markers such as FIB4, liver-stiffness measurement (LSM), assessment of hepatic
venous pressure gradient and/or varices (endoscopy) and traditional measures of liver function. These are
unfortunately limited by modest accuracy of some models, retrospective, single center nature of most data-sets
published and lack of information on the impact of changes in these parameters over time with respect to dynamic
changes in risk profile. This proposal innovates by novel application and integration of systemic, hepatic
perfusion and function, and portal hypertension related parameters to holistically model the risk of LACE and
generate a probability score that is sensitive to change. We will specifically focus on MRI-based measures of
systemic metabolic dysfunction (metabo-phenotype), gadoxetate uptake and clearance (integrated measure of
hepatic perfusion and clearance function) and spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) as a surrogate for portal
hypertension. We further propose the novel hypothesis that holistic models including these measures and
capturing the multi-factorial origin of hepatic decompensation events are superior to conventional tools used in
routine practice to define the probability of LACE in patients with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH. The
hypothesis will be tested in a longitudinal cohort study of compensated cirrhosis due to NASH. The specific
measures of the metabo-phenotype will include visceral adipose tissue volume, fat-free muscle volume, muscle
fat infiltration. Gadoxetate uptake and clearance will be measured in a 10-minute exam. The SSM probe was
recently approved and will be deployed on Fibroscan 630 the flagship instrument for transient elastography.
Metabo-phenotyping requires implementing an imaging protocol, based on a routine clinical imaging sequence,
onto standard clinical scanners which adds less than 10 minutes of scan-time while gadoxetate is routinely used
for liver-imaging. Sub-aim 1 will model baseline parameters, alone and in combination, to define outcome risk
within 1-2 years. Sub-aim 2 will evaluate dynamic changes in values of the test measures over time and relate
them to changes in the risk of outcomes. Both regression and machine learned approaches will be taken to
generate probability scores of the outcomes. Sensitivity analyses will be performed to test the robustness of the
models. The patient populations needed and all of the methods/expertise are available. The rationale of this
proposal is that it will provide a method for risk-identification in those with NASH-cirrhosis which can be
incorporated in to clinical care. This will have a strong positive impact by improving individual patient care, drug
development and optimizing care delivery by identifying the population that will benefit most from therapeutics."
10882920,"Project Abstract
In this project, we will identify context-specific enhancers, whose activity is essential for either the
growth of primary tumors or for evolution of treatment-resistance in metastatic tumors by
modulation of target gene expression. We will identify open chromatin sites in metastatic
treatment-resistant breast tumors using whole-genome sequencing of cell-free DNA. Cell-free
(cfDNA)
enzymatic
 in plasma predominantly originates from nucleosome-protected parts of DNA after
 processing. We will develop innovative computational methods that will analyze the
nucleosomal signal obtained from whole-genome sequencing of cfDNA from plasma of metastatic
cancer patients. We will develop scalable methods to create catalogues of `oncogenic' enhancers
that are essential for tumor growth, which may or may not be due to DNA sequence variants at
these regions. We will decipher the impact of subtype specific enhancer perturbation on tumor
initiation (using CRIPSRa) and continued growth (using CRISPRi) in primary breast cancers. We
will test the impact of repressing ~15,000 accessible sites in breast cancer on tumor growth in
pooled CRISPR screens in multiple cell lines for each major breast cancer subtype. Importantly,
we will also study the impact of activation of the same enhancers on tumor initiation in normal
(and malignant) breast cell lines, and we will identify `tumor-suppressive' enhancers that when
silenced drive tumor growth. We will also identify oncogenic mutations by integration of 4,427
breast cancer whole-genomes and CRISPR base editing screens. We will focus on specific
mutations at cis-regulatory elements, CREs (enhancers, promoters and untranslated regions).
For the top 5000 putative noncoding drivers, we will first insert precise mutations via base editing
and then, for the top 500 with the most dramatic impact on growth, we will use single-cell
sequencing coupled with base editing to decipher their impact on gene expression in cis and in
trans. We will also examine the interaction between the top noncoding drivers and aromatase
inhibitors, which is a therapy prescribed in many breast cancers."
10884408,"ABSTRACT:
 The World Health Organization reports cardiovascular disease (CVD) as the global leading cause of death.
Our long-term goal is to improve public health by advancing clinical therapies and management of CVD.
Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) has emerged as a dietary derived metabolite highly predictive of atherosclerosis
and CVD mortality. It is robustly elevated in humans with CVD across multiple independent studies, and its
dietary supplementation causes atherosclerosis in animal models. But efforts to leverage the TMAO pathway
therapeutically are met with skepticism, as a clear mechanism of TMAO action continues to be elusive.
Therefore, defining the mechanism of TMAO-induced atherosclerosis is of fundamental importance to produce
meaningful change in treatment options for those dying of CVD. Recently, our lab reported the first and only
known receptor for TMAO; TMAO specifically binds and activates the stress signaling kinase PKR-like
Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase (PERK). However, two central questions are still unaddressed: 1) how does
TMAO-activation of PERK drive disease, and 2) is PERK activity required for TMAO to cause atherosclerosis?
This proposal presents a research strategy to answer the above questions. We report preliminary data that acute
TMAO causes PERK phosphorylation (pPERK) in mouse aorta, and that chronic TMAO feeding increases aortic
inflammation in a PERK dependent manner. We also show use of a PERK inhibitor prevents TMAO-induced
increases of CVD risk factors, blood glucose and plasma cholesterol. Further, we confirm that TMAO activates
pPERK, but also that it induces a unique conformational state distinct from classically described PERK activation
by unfolded proteins. Thus, our central hypothesis is that TMAO drives atherosclerosis via a unique
activation of the PERK axis. In Aim 1, we propose to define TMAO’s effects on the PERK signaling complex
in the vasculature. In Aim 2, we will test the requirement of PERK in TMAO’s ability to cause atherosclerosis in
ApoE-/- mice. The experiments described will identify a long-sought mechanism of how TMAO causes
atherosclerosis, and they will investigate how activation of the stress response protein, PERK, induces cellular
dysfunction. The proposed training plan covers training in molecular and physiologic tools to assess metabolic
contributions to CVD, presentation, communication, and publication opportunities, and an overall roadmap for
growing into a productive and collaborative independent investigator. Additionally, the institutional environment
at both the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Boston Children’s Hospital ensures robust access to
abundant resources and equipment, core facilities, and brilliant minds that will continually support the growing
needs of the project. We believe the enclosed aims will interrogate the role of PERK in mediating the well-
described effect of TMAO-induced CVD, and they will open a flood gate of therapeutic options already lying-in
wait to prevent premature cardiovascular deaths."
10883237,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The elderly proportion of the human population is increasing rapidly on a global scale leading to unprecedented
demographic shift impacting families, governments and health care systems. In addition to being at higher risk
for developing chronic disease, older individuals are more vulnerable than younger adults to infectious diseases,
including viral infections, and often exhibit higher incidence, severity and mortality rates. Moreover, the aged
organism represents a favorable environment for the accumulation of mutations in viral genomes that could
possibly result in the emergence of novel pathogenic strains of significant public health concern. The exact
mechanisms leading to that, however, are not known. Despite numerous advances in understanding virus-host
interactions, we do not know if differential processes underlie these relationships as a function of age. With ever-
increasing numbers of older persons on the planet, appropriate preventive and treatment strategies leading to a
longer, healthier life are becoming increasingly urgent. Consequently, there is great need to unravel the
fundamental mechanisms that allow the aged organism to survive infection and limit pathogen spread.
 Here, we propose to use the model organism Drosophila melanogaster to identify the mechanisms that
contribute to age-dependent survival of infection with the RNA Flock House Virus (FHV) and the influence of the
aged organism on viral pathogenicity. The host and the virus reciprocally affect each other and we will examine
both how the aged host responds to, and conversely affects, the virus. We propose to use an innovative
combination of genetic, molecular, metabolic and next generation sequencing methods to: (1) determine how
modulation of host’s metabolism in older individuals aids in survival of viral infection and (2) determine how the
aged organism’s physiological milieu impacts the evolution of RNA virus pathogenicity. Our experiments will
focus on investigating the role of infection tolerance mechanisms that rely on the modulation of organismal
metabolism as an age-dependent strategy to survive infection. To determine how the aged host’s physiological
environment potentiates RNA virus pathogenicity, we will examine the architecture of viral genomes, including
the build up of defective viral species, following replication in older versus younger individuals, and over several
passages in vivo. We will also test the contribution of increased oxidative stress in this process using both genetic
and pharmacological approaches, and perform pathogenicity studies using identified candidate viral variants.
The underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms are likely to be conserved from flies to humans and our
studies will provide important new insights filling the knowledge gap about the interactions of viruses and aged
hosts in general. Our studies could potentially lead to therapeutic improvements for infected elderly patients as
well as to the prevention of the emergence of novel viral strains."
10880982,"Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) produce profound motor and cognitive impairment
associated with aggregation of α-synuclein (αS). Female sex is commonly reported to delay the age of onset and to
produce milder phenotypes, but the reasons are unknown. Accumulation of αS is increasingly implicated in familial
and sporadic forms of these synucleinopathies. Our lab has discovered that female sex preserved a part of
physiologically folded, aggregate-resistant tetrameric αS in PD-type mice, supporting published evidence for the
existence of normal multimeric αS forms in healthy brain. During the first grant period, we have analyzed female sex
and elevation of brain estradiol (by the estradiol prodrug DHED) and showed it can normalize the αS tetramer-
monomer ratio and decrease early LB-type aggregates. Given this progress, we now wish to extend this novel
hypothesis to answer certain key questions about protective estrogen pathways that could be used as disease
modifying treatments. Our proposed new experiments will be enabled by our early-onset, progressive mouse models
in which the E46K-like tetramer abrogating αS mutation (3K) caused sex dimorphism early in the PD-type
neuropathology development. In aim 1, we will determine the age- and sex dependencies of αS pathological
aggregation for WT, 1K and 3K in premature and mature mice. The studies will be controlled in mice with depleted
estrogen. In aim 2, we will investigate the role of extranuclear and synaptic estrogen receptor on the temporal
relationship between changes in synaptic function (electrophysiological studies) and alterations in αS pathologic
aggregation (histopathology and biochemical studies) in genetic model mice with membrane-only estrogen receptor
alpha. We will further examine the effectiveness of a novel therapy that increases palmitoylation (using a small
molecule inhibitor for acyl-protein thioesterase 1) and thereby the level of synaptic estrogen receptors. In aim 3, we
will determine, whether the shared αS tetramer-abrogation by PD risk factors (GBA1-L444P, GBA1-E326K) known
for pathologic excess of soluble wildtype αS monomer accumulation and that produces more severity by male sex,
are also responsive to DHED treatment. We will compare these with our novel familial G51D-and amplified (3D) mice
with excess soluble mutant αS. The results of these studies will be far reaching as they will provide the foundation to
understanding mechanisms through which estrogen prevents αS dyshomeostasis in the brain of robust PD-type mice
in vivo, to improve and create neuroprotective treatments in PD, DLB and Gaucher’s PD."
10881472,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The objective of this proposal is to define the mechanism and functional role of innate immune signaling events
during base damaging cancer chemotherapy. These agents induce base damage on RNA as well as DNA. We
have recently discovered that cells elicit an RNA-dependent innate immune response upon encountering
alkylating agents, which represent one of the most commonly used systemic chemotherapies for cancer
treatment. Our preliminary data demonstrates that alkylating agents induce a DAMP (damage associated
molecular pattern) response, akin to the signaling observed during viral infection, which is known to impact
downstream cellular events such as apoptosis. In contrast to other types of DNA damaging agents, this pathway
depends on the RNA-associated DAMP receptor RIG-I and requires spliceosomal activity. Furthermore, we have
found that ASCC1, which encodes a protein with a metal-independent RNA phosphoesterase domain,
associates with intronic RNAs upon damage and is required for the induction of the DAMP response during
alkylation. These and other data strongly suggest a model where spliceosome-associated processing of
damaged RNA activates DAMP signaling, and may have functional consequences for tumor cell fate upon base
damage. In this proposal, we will determine the mechanism by which ASCC1 functions with its associated partner
proteins to gain access to damaged nascent RNAs and process them as part of this response, and determine
the function consequence of this signaling pathway (Aim 1). In turn, we will characterize the RNA structures that
activate RIG-I during alkylation stress and reconstitute RIG-I signaling with purified components (Aim 2).
Together, these studies will shed light on a hitherto undescribed mechanism by which a nuclear RNA quality
control pathway is connected to innate immune signaling."
10880446,"Project Summary/Abstract
A series of epidemiological studies have shown that people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) have a significantly
higher risk of developing melanoma and vice-versa. However, research on this comorbidity is sparse. One
possible point of convergence lies in the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Studies have shown that activating
sympathetic axons residing in breast adenocarcinomas increases cancer growth and metastasis. Extending this,
our preliminary data suggest that mice implanted with melanoma allografts and carrying a knock-in form of the
LRRK2-G2019S mutation, the most common genetic contributor to PD, have enriched populations of
sympathetic axons in their tumor microenvironment. Therefore, I hypothesize that a PD environment
produces an altered melanoma response by regulating the activity and innervation of sympathetic axons
in the tumor microenvironment. To investigate this, I am first characterizing melanoma progression and its
neural microenvironment in WT and LRRK2-G2019S-knock in (GSKI) mice. The data show that the extent and
pattern of melanoma growth is altered significantly in GSKI mice and that immunolabeled tumors show altered
patterns of innervation, macrophage infiltration and angiogenesis. These and additional data will be used to
establish the conditions and timing for testing whether LRRK2-G2019S-mediated alterations in melanoma growth
lie downstream of local sympathetic axonal activity and to ascertain whether positive results can be reversed by
inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity, which is significantly elevated with the G2019S mutation. Studying the
downstream effects of sympathetic axonal activity and innervation in a tumor microenvironment will create a
fuller understanding of the neural mechanisms connecting PD and melanoma."
10880320,"Abstract – Inhibition of T-Cell Receptor Signaling for Treatment of Adult T-Cell Leukemia Lymphoma
 Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) is an
aggressive lymphoproliferative malignancy. Despite aggressive chemotherapy, this disorder is fatal in almost all
individuals. Our preliminary results, and those of others, uncovered a high rate of mutations in the T-cell receptor
(TCR) signaling pathway in ATLL, with frequent mutations in phospholipase Cγ, protein kinase Cβ (PKCβ), and
caspase recruitment domain containing protein 11 (CARD11) leading to activation of transcription factors nuclear
factor κB (NFκB) and interferon-regulatory factor 4 (IRF4). We hypothesize that this pathway drives ATLL
development and/or progression and targeted therapy against this pathway will synergize with combination
chemotherapy. We also suggest that lenalidomide represses IRF4 expression in ATLL. We propose to assess:
Aim 1: Role of IRF4 activation in ATLL through RNAseq and functional analysis of IRF4-dependent gene
targets. We will also determine if repression of IRF4 mediates the cytotoxic effects of lenalidomide in ATLL.
Aim 2: Phase 1 study of lenalidomide in combination with EPOCH chemotherapy for HTLV-ATLL is
conducted through the ETCTN, and correlative studies performed in the current project to assess whether
efficacy of lenalidomide is mediated through effects on IRF4, and depend on mutations in TCR pathway
components. HTLV load, expression, and clonality assays will be used to monitor the efficacy of therapy.
Aim 3: Role of PKCβ activation in ATLL will be examined as an alternative therapeutic target, based on
sensitivity of ATLL cells to inhibitors, enzastaurin and midostaurin. We will assess whether sensitivity to these
inhibitors are affected by mutations in PKCβ or CARD11, which often co-occur in ATLL.
This study will provide in-depth knowledge of the role of TCR signaling in ATLL, and new therapeutic targets."

ABSTRACT:
The launch of the Molecular Characterization Initiative (MCI) provides an unprecedented
resource of molecular data on children with newly diagnosed cancers, including over 1000
participants with primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) in the first year. The
Children's Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) is a consortium of institutions committed to genomic

CBTN has collected longitudinal clinical and biological data on over 5000 participants with CNS
tumors over the past decade, data which is shared in open cloud-based platforms. Seattle
Children's Hospital as part of the Fred Hutch/UW comprehensive cancer center is uniquely
positioned as a founding member of CBTN and the highest enrolling site on MCI to conduct the
pilot study proposed to 1) develop a pipeline to automate data extraction from the electronic
medical record in partnership with CBTN and Amazon Web Services (AWS) teams, 2) increase
imaging data available through CBTN and CCDI and 3) connect CBTN and MCI data at the

10879747,"Project Summary/Abstract
The prevalence of aging adults with Down syndrome (DS) has increased dramatically in the past few decades
as their life expectancy has more than doubled. Most adults with DS will develop pathology associated with
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) as early as age 31. By age 65 the cumulative incidence of dementia exceeds 90%
and is the leading cause of death in adults with DS. AD in adults with DS is associated with reduced functional
independence and associated increased burden on their caregivers. Increased physical activity is associated
with improved physical function and performance of activities of daily living in typically developed adults with
dementia, resulting in reduced burden for their caregivers. However, interventions designed to increase
physical activity in adults with DS and reduce caregiver burden are currently unavailable.
Reducing Disability in Alzheimer’s Disease (RDAD) is a 12-week intervention designed for typically developed
adults and their caregivers delivered during home visits. RDAD includes increased physical activity for the
adult with AD and training for caregivers in the management of dementia-related behavioral symptoms and has
been shown to be effective in typically developed adults with dementia and their caregivers. Data from a small
sample of adults with intellectual disabilities, including DS, suggest the potential efficacy of the RDAD
approach for increasing physical activity and reducing behavioral symptoms in adults with intellectual
disabilities and reducing burden in their caregivers. However, RDAD is not tailored to the unique needs of
adults with DS and their caregivers and is delivered by interventionists during individual home visits which
limits the potential for reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the interventions. Our objective is
to support the training of Dr. Amy Bodde through an NIH INCLUDE initiative KL2 Scholar slot. This training will
include didactic and mentored experiential opportunities to develop her skills in: 1) clinical and translational
research, including adapting evidence-based interventions, remote delivery of physical activity interventions,
assessment of intervention usability, feasibility, safety, acceptability and efficacy, and dyadic analysis; 2) the
physiologic and psychosocial aspects of the development, identification and care of dementia in adults with
DS, and; 3) professional development required to become an independent clinical investigator. Completion of
the proposed training and research plan to adapt and evaluate the feasibility of RDAD for Down syndrome
(RDAD-DS) will provide Dr. Bodde with the knowledge and experience to move forward with her research
career and will generate preliminary data to inform the development of a proposal to seek R01 funding to
conduct an adequately powered randomized Stage II/III trial to evaluate the efficacy of the RDAD-DS

10880148,"ABSTRACT:
Immunotherapy has led to remarkable improvements in patient survival for many tumor types. In particular,
immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown efficacy in many cancer types. These drugs act by turning off pathways
that inactivate T-cells and allow patients’ adaptive immune response to attack tumors,. However, very little is
known about how immunotherapy affects different racial and ethnic populations.
Breast cancer is a disease with substantial disparities in outcomes. Black women have particularly high risk of
mortality from breast cancer and also have higher risk of “triple negative” (estrogen receptor, progesterone
receptor and Her2 negative) breast cancer (TNBC) which is more responsive to immunotherapy. The tumor
immune microenvironment is a strong prognostic factor among women with breast cancer and a strong predictor
of benefit from immunotherapy. In preliminary data, we have found that breast tumors from women of African
ancestry have higher rates of lymphocytic infiltration which is generally associated with better response to
immunotherapy. However, there is no clear data on how well Black women, Hispanic/Latina or Asian women do
on checkpoint inhibitors.
In this application, we will focus on breast cancer disparities and immuno-oncology in the Research Project.
First, we will population based (cancer registry) data to determine how frequently women of different racial, ethnic
and ancestry groups with TNBC are treated with immunotherapy. We will also leverage an existing trial of locally
advanced breast cancer, ISPY2, which includes an immune checkpoint inhibitor. The trial will allow us to examine
genetic ancestry in addition to race and ethnicity. Second, we will examine the tumor immune microenvironment
among women with breast cancer in relation to genetic ancestry and in relation to genetic variants that we have
identified as associated with the tumor immune microenvironment. We will perform deep characterization using
single nuclear RNA-sequencing of a subset of the trial women, comparing responders to non-responders
selected by stratification on race and ethnicity.
We will integrate all of these data and leverage the organizational structure of the accompanying Administrative
Core to interpret these data within the context of what is already known about cancer immunology,
immunotherapy and health disparities. We will build on these results and other projects and datasets to plan
larger projects to address more ambitious questions of how different populations respond to immunotherapy,
how their rates of adverse events compare."
10874326,"Project Summary:
Investigating the role of lipid metabolism in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles
Lysosome-related organelles (LROs) are cell type-specific compartments that share characteristics with
ubiquitous conventional lysosomes, yet have specialized functions. LROs are evolutionarily conserved
derivatives of the endosomal system that include mammalian melanosomes and platelet dense granules, gut
granules in C. elegans, Drosophila pigment granules, and acidocalcisomes in protozoan parasites. Defective
LRO biogenesis leads to Hermansky-Pudlak (HPS) and Chediak-Higashi (CHS) syndromes, which cause
partial albinism and delayed blood clotting. It is surprising how little attention has been focused on processes
controlling LRO size and shape, given how tied LRO morphology is to mechanisms controlling LRO
biogenesis, homeostasis, and function. Enlarged LROs are pathogenic in CHS and are diagnostic of HPS1,
the most common form of HPS. Prior approaches to identify factors involved in LRO biogenesis have not been
designed to identify factors regulating LRO morphology. LRO morphology is controlled by the interplay of
membrane trafficking to and from LROs as well as LRO fission and fusion, processes fundamental to the
biogenesis, behavior, and activity of LROs. Identifying and characterizing the activity of conserved genes that
impact LRO morphology will likely lead to new insights into the processes regulating LRO biogenesis.
 The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the processes controlling LRO morphology by
studying acdh-11, which we identified in a screen for mutants that disrupt the morphology of C. elegans LROs
called gut granules. ACDH-11 is a highly conserved member of the medically important acyl-CoA
dehydrogenase (ACDH) family that catalyze the beta-oxidation and catabolism of fatty acids and amino acids.
Our work showing acdh-11(-) mutants cause gut granule enlargement identifies a novel role for an ACDH
protein. The FAT-7 fatty acid desaturase becomes expressed and is in part required for LRO enlargement in
acdh-11(-) mutants. FAT-7 catalyzes the creation of unsaturated fatty acids, which can promote membrane
fluidity by disrupting lipid packing. Our results support the possibility that changing the physical characteristics
of membranes influences membrane dynamics to increase gut granule size. The mechanisms by which ACDH-
11 and FAT-7 function to impact LRO size is investigated through four specific aims: (1) investigate how
ACDH-11 impacts gut granule size by defining where ACDH-11 acts and whether it functions enzymatically or
as a sink for fatty acid substrates; (2) test whether FAT-7 causes the enlargement of gut granules in acdh-11(-)
mutants by increasing unsaturated fatty acids within the membranes of intestinal cells; (3) analyze whether gut
granule enlargement in acdh-11(-) results from increased membrane fluidity; and (4) identify other genes and
pathways acting in acdh-11(-) to promote gut granule enlargement and FAT-7 expression. This work explores
novel roles for an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and fatty acid desaturase in organelle size and furthers our
understanding of how lipids contribute to the formation and homeostasis of LROs."
10874337,"Project Summary. Sortase enzymes are cysteine transpeptidases located on the cell surface of Gram-positive
bacteria, which attach a variety of proteins to the peptidoglycan cell wall. The first sortase discovered, the Class
A sortase from Staphylococcus aureus (saSrtA), is widely used in sortase-mediated ligation (SML) or sortagging
protein engineering applications. This is a versatile protein with numerous human health and disease
implications; recent examples include the use of an engineered saSrtA to identify and disrupt amyloid-b
aggregates in a neurodegeneration model and to construct multi-arm SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobodies.
SrtA is also a potential antibiotic target, as it is an essential protein in these pathogenic bacteria. However, recent
work from ourselves and others reveals that the stringent target selectivity of saSrtA is not shared amongst other
Class A sortases, e.g., those from the Streptococcus or Listeria genera. Furthermore, other classes of sortases
are extremely understudied with respect to SrtA proteins, and could provide useful tools for SML applications.
Class B sortases (SrtBs), for example, recognize a different motif sequence, which may be exploited to expand
the capabilities of SML. Finally, early evidence suggests that the transmembrane region of saSrtA may play an
important role in the catalytic efficiency of this enzyme, but this has not been thoroughly investigated.
 The overall objectives in this application are to (i) dissect selectivity and activity determinants in sortase
enzymes from multiple classes, including the transmembrane regions of sortases and/or their substrates, and
(ii) use bacterial display to create a high throughput assay to measure sortase selectivity, which would be
applicable broadly to all classes of sortases. The central hypothesis is that we can use protein biochemistry,
chemical biology, and computational biology to better understand these enzymes. The rationale of this project is
that a deep understanding of the general characteristics of sortase biology can be leveraged to develop new
SML strategies for protein engineering, and assist in targeted antibiotic design to improve human health. The
central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) dissect selectivity and activity determinants
in SrtA enzymes by characterizing differences in protein dynamics and elucidating extended motif preferences,
as well as develop a high throughout bacterial display assay for sortase selectivity, 2) advance a molecular
understanding of SrtB activities in order to improve reaction rates, and 3) characterize the role of the
transmembrane regions of sortase and its substrates in catalysis. All aims will utilize protein biochemistry,
structural biology, chemical biology, and computational biology. The research proposed in this application is
innovative in that we will be developing new assays and applying techniques not previously used with sortase
enzymes, continuing our work as a productive collaborative team to investigate aspects of sortase enzymes not
currently well understood. The proposed research is significant because our work will inform next-generation
SML methods and can be applied to the development of new antibiotics for Gram-positive bacterial pathogens."

Background. The volume of patients who meet national criteria for germline genetic testing based on a cancer
diagnosis alone, regardless of family history (i.e. ovarian, pancreatic, advanced prostate, etc.) is rapidly growing.
Germline genetic test results can inform oncology and surgical treatment decisions, as well as early detection
and prevention for the family. However, traditional pre- and post-test genetic counseling approaches may not be
sufficient to meet the growing need. Additionally, traditional pre-test counseling may be a barrier, leading to
decreased uptake, especially in those with advanced disease. Patients cared for in settings with limited or no
genetic services, including low-literacy, non-English speaking, and rural community patients already face
disparities in access. As such, these patients remain underrepresented in clinical and research cohorts, and
innovative strategies to optimize genetic counseling approaches are understudied. Relational Agents (RAs)
are an effective means of automating health education and counseling, as well as overcoming literacy
barriers in the use of information technologies. RAs, animated computer characters simulate face-to-face
conversation between a patient and a provider using verbal and nonverbal conversational behavior. Overall
Goals. This study will develop an English and Spanish RA to communicate personalized pre-test genetic
education to a cohort of cancer patients who meet established cancer-based genetic testing criteria across two
diverse clinical settings (including a low-resource, urban, safety-net hospital and a university medical center that
serves a significant rural population). We hypothesize that the use of an RA will increase the proportion of
patients who receive genetic test results within 90 days of initiating cancer care, compared to usual care. Aim
1 is to develop an English- and Spanish-language RA using a patient-driven approach. Aim 2 is to conduct a
multisite randomized controlled trial of the RA to deliver pre-test education versus usual care in English- and
Spanish-speaking patients to compare the proportion in each arm who receive genetic test results in 90 days at
Los Angeles County+University of Southern California Medical Center and University of Rochester Medical
Center. Aim 3 is to understand the implementation context and identify facilitators and barriers to utilizing the
RA in these clinical settings. Impact. Our deliverable will be multilingual patient-facing RA to deliver pre-test
genetic education. This RA will be developed and evaluated in two distinct patient populations and clinic
workflows, can be rapidly updated as practice evolves, and will ultimately be available on the internet for clinics
and patients to utilize. If successful, this would be a novel, effective, and scalable means of providing genetics
education that could improve patient decisional preparedness, knowledge, and satisfaction, ultimately leading to
increased access for patient populations who are traditionally underserved in genetics. Understanding the
implementation context and identifying facilitators and barriers to integrating a RA will increase sustainability and
generalizability."

Cervical cancer screening programs remain essential to reduce cervical cancer in women despite
the availability of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines. Screening is important for all women
but is particularly important for women living with HIV given the high prevalence of HPV in this
group and risks associated with progression notwithstanding antiretroviral therapy. Here we
propose to investigate the clinical utility of a new method of automated digital imaging of the cervix
on the MobileODT platform as a screen-and-treat approach. We build on a long-term collaboration
between the University of Cape Town and Columbia University investigating how to strengthen
cervical cancer screening and treatment in South Africa. Currently, screen-and-treat programs
utilizing HPV DNA testing are recommended by the World Health Organization. We have
demonstrated the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this approach for the South African
setting with its high HIV prevalence in women. In this setting, we are currently completing an NCI-
supported study demonstrating the feasibility and outstanding performance of an HPV DNA assay
that can be used at the point-of-care for a single-visit, screen-and-treat program. Here we propose
to extend this work to investigate in Specific Aim 1: the performance characteristics of automated
digital imaging as a standalone, primary screening test to replace HPV DNA testing for use in the
single-visit, screen-and-treat approach; Specific Aim 2: the performance characteristics of
automated digital imaging as a triage test for women who test HPV DNA positive in the screen-
and-treat approach; and Specific Aim 3: facility-level operational challenges and facilitators to
integrating this new imaging technology into single-visit screen-and-treat programs. We propose
to undertake the studies to address these aims among women living with and without HIV at
clinical sites in Cape Town, South Africa. Our overall goal is to strengthen cervical cancer
screening approaches to reduce cost and improve the effectiveness of screening."
10880343,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Blood flow and cellular metabolism are two basic but vital physiological processes that are often dysregulated
in major diseases. Imaging of flow-metabolism mismatch or coupling is of broad clinical and research
significance in many diseases, for instance, in ischemic cardiomyopathy for assessing myocardial viability, in
cancer for grading tumor aggressiveness, and in neurodegenerative diseases for studying brain function. A
major challenge in PET imaging of flow-metabolism is that scanning for these two processes requires two
different radiotracers–18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for metabolism and a second flow radiotracer for
perfusion imaging. While FDG is widely available in the clinic for metabolic imaging, perfusion imaging by PET
is clinically limited, resulting in underutilization of flow-metabolism imaging in both research and clinics. The
goal of this project is to develop a single-tracer multiparametric PET imaging solution for simultaneous flow-
metabolism imaging using only 18F-FDG without the need for a second flow-specific radiotracer. Early attempts
from others and our group have used FDG blood-to-tissue delivery rate (K1) as a proxy of blood flow. However,
the accuracy of FDG K1 approximating blood flow largely depends on the FDG extraction fraction in tissues
and is also compromised by the correlation between FDG K1 and blood glucose levels. Our preliminary work
has tackled these problems specifically in the myocardium and demonstrated the feasibility of using FDG for
measuring myocardial blood flow. The focus of this proposal is to extend the effort to a large study and to the
whole body, and further develop the enabling techniques to improve FDG blood flow quantification. We will (1)
develop glucose-normalized extraction fraction correction for FDG blood flow quantification in various organs
using total-body dynamic PET; (2) develop high-temporal resolution kinetic modeling for improved FDG blood
flow quantification; (3) improve FDG blood flow imaging on short PET scanners using advanced image
reconstruction. Successful completion of this project will develop a new technical capability of 18F-FDG for
simultaneous multiparametric imaging of blood flow and glucose metabolism with reduced radiation dose,
imaging time and cost. This would also open up many new opportunities for clinical applications that require
multiparametric imaging biomarkers but have been historically restricted by the accessibility of perfusion
imaging, thus making a broad impact in multiple PET applications for patient clinical care and research."

Nearly every stressor reactivates the fetal gene program in cardiac myocytes, but why they make this transition
is unclear given fetal metabolic and functional reprogramming is insufficient to sustain adult cardiac performance
yet this fate change negatively impacts cardiac regeneration, which is an underlying determinant of heart failure.
Thus, understanding fetal to adult myocyte state transitions is has broad therapeutic impact when considering
how to boost the heart’s performance and tolerance for pathologic stress. A potent regulator of fetal to adult state
transitions and the switch from hyperplastic to hypertrophic growth in the postnatal heart is an RNA binding
protein causal for myotonic dystrophy (DM), Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1). Mosaic MBNL1 deficiency was newly
identified in the myocyte population following 2 weeks of pressure overload. Interestingly, only the MBNL1
deficient myocytes reactivated the fetal gene program, suggesting MBNL1 might regulate this switch during
cardiac stress. Indeed experimentally-derived MBNL1 deficiency in nearly every myocyte prevented pressure
overload-induced hypertrophic remodeling, but these hearts rapidly decompensated which we ascribe to their
inability to divide or hypertrophy. By contrast MBNL1 overexpression in pressure overloaded hearts prevented
fetal gene reprogramming and increases hypertrophic growth broadly across the myocyte population.
Collectively these data suggest a model whereby MBNL1 appears to regulate the optimal distribution of fetal
versus adult myocytes states needed to preserve cardiac performance in response stress and MBNL1-driven
deviations in those distributions determine the nature and severity of maladaptive remodeling. Hence this
application will test this hypothetical model by [1] examining the contribution of mosaic MBNL1 deficiency to the
nature and severity of cardiac remodeling in response to pathologic and physiologic increases in workload, [2]
determining the effects of maintaining MBNL1 expression in myocytes on cardiac remodeling, and [3] comparing
the effects of human mosaic MBNL1 deficiency from genetic deletion or DM on engineered cardiac tissue growth,
maturation, and performance in response to afterload."
10879288,"Metastasis is the major cause of cancer mortality. Effective therapies are urgently needed for patients with
metastatic diseases. Increasing evidence suggests that interactions between cancer cells and tumor immune
microenvironment drive metastatic progression. Although prior studies established the vital roles of
immunosuppressive TME in metastatic progression, the epigenetic determinant in shaping the metastatic niche
remains understudied. Absent, small or homeotic 1-like (ASH1L) is a histone lysine methyltransferase that
induces methylations at H3K36 and . Although ASH1L was found to drive
leukemogenesis, little is known about its biological function in solid tumors and metastatic disease. Our
preliminary studies showed that ASH1L is genetically amplified and overexpressed in metastatic tumors and
contributes to metastasis and immunosuppression. The goal of this application is to determine the role and
mechanisms of action of ASH1L in the metastatic niche. The central hypothesis in this application is that histone
H3K4 and activates gene transcription
methyltransferase ASH1L contributes to the immunosuppressive metastatic niche and is a potential therapeutic
target in metastatic cancers. In the proposed studies, we will 1) determine ASH1L’s role in reshaping the
metastatic niche by combining a newly developed genetically engineered mouse model and cutting-edge single-
cell transcriptomic technologies; 2) elucidate the mechanism by which ASH1L induces immunosuppressive
metastatic niche by performing epigenetic profiling, proteomic approaches, and functional studies; 3) determine
the anti-metastatic effects of genetically depleting or pharmacologically inhibiting ASH1L in combination with
checkpoint immunotherapy in preclinical models, followed by profiling their impact on immune components in
the metastatic niche. We expect to identify ASH1L as a key epigenetic determinant in priming
immunosuppressive metastatic niche and develop effective targeted therapy and combinatorial immunotherapy
for metastatic cancers. These studies are expected to have significant positive impacts, including bridging the
knowledge gap on the role and mechanisms of action of an understudied epigenetic factor ASH1L in metastatic
cancers, advancing our understanding of the crosstalk between invading cancer cells and immune components
in the metastatic niche, and offering implications in regard to the biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and rational
combinations for metastatic malignancies.

10882629,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Paligenosis is a recently described evolutionarily conserved repair mechanism that tissues use for regeneration
in response to injury. Paligenosis is characterized by the recruitment of differentiated cells back into the cell cycle
through a defined 3-stage process, and is thus an important repair pathway when adult stem cells are insufficient.
Aberrant paligenosis underlies chronic metaplasia and tumorigenesis. In prior work, the investigators have used
both a high-dose tamoxifen (HDT) acute model and a chronic inflammation model incorporating Helicobacter
pylori (HP) to induce zymogenic chief cells to reprogram into spasmolytic-polypeptide expressing metaplasia
(SPEM) via the paligenosis pathway. They showed that ATF3 and IFRD1 play crucial roles in paligenosis.
Additional preliminary data indicates that the early stages of paligenosis is activated by the unfolded-protein
response (UPR) wing of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), which is governed by the PERK kinase, whereas
the dsRNA-responding (ISR) enzyme PKR contributes to the later stages of paligenosis. Preliminary data also
indicate that early disassembly of rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) is an early paligenosis event. This supports
a hypothesis that the early events of paligenosis are driven by the PERK wing of the ISR and the dynamic
regulation and autophagy of rER. Aim 1 of this project thus seeks to detail activation of PERK over a granular
timecourse early in paligenosis in HDT and Helicobacter models, and then test the PERK requirement using
PERK and ISR inhibitors, ISR-deficient Eif2aS51A mice, and Perkflox/flox mice crossed to chief cell-specific promoter
mice. Sufficiency will be tested by inducing UPR and by drug-induced activation of PERK. Aim 2 will detail
paligenotic ER remodeling in HDT and HP models, as well as investigate the impact of blocking
autophagolysome activity in paligenotic-lysosome-defective Atf3−/− mice. Using ER-phagy defective mice
(Ccpg1flox/flox), the effects of ISR and ER-phagy deficiency on tumorigenesis will also be examined in an
established mouse model of paligenosis and tumor formation. Aim 3 will expand on the sample size and
timepoints of our pilot phosphoproteome data, and localize protein and phosphoprotein expression in paligenotic
cells by corroboration with single-cell RNA-sequencing. This multi-omic approach enables generation of a
comprehensive map of the protein and kinase activity that governs the early stages of paligenosis, while also
opening a pipeline for future discovery of paligenosis genes that may be novel therapeutic targets for prevention
of metaplasia and its associated complications in various tissues."
10881420,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While most forms of dementia arise from irreversible, degenerative processes, normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)
symptoms can often be alleviated by placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt to divert cerebrospinal fluid from the
characteristically enlarged ventricles. However, due to overlapping clinical and biomarker phenotypes with other
common age-related disorders, NPH remains substantially underdiagnosed and undertreated. Even when
diagnosed, current methods are limited in predicting outcomes of shunt surgery, particularly when considering
noninvasive methods.
Since the disorder was first described, it has been hypothesized that the intracranial mechanical environment was
involved in NPH pathogenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, we recently reported that NPH is associated with a
characteristic pattern of brain viscoelasticity, as measured by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Furthermore,
the presence of this pattern is sensitive and specific for differentiating NPH patients from healthy volunteers and those
with Alzheimer’s clinical syndrome. While MRE is an accurate diagnostic biomarker for NPH, we expect that with
further technical development, MRE will also enable accurate prediction of treatment outcomes. In our preliminary
data, patients with low brain stiffness are less likely to benefit from shunting. However, these predictions are not yet
accurate enough to use clinically. We hypothesize that the existing discrepancies arise from an ambiguity that low
brain stiffness, as measured by current technology, can result either from decreased stiffness in the solid tissue matrix
or increased fluid content in the extracellular space. These two effects must be disentangled to identify the patients
with preserved matrix stiffness as those most likely to benefit from shunting.
Therefore, the overall goal of this work is to develop an MRE framework that jointly leverages strain and diffusion
measurements to estimate the viscoelastic properties of the solid matrix while accounting for interspersed
extracellular fluid. In Aim 1, we will modify the forward model of our machine learning-based inversion framework to
account for subvoxel fluid elements. We will then evaluate the algorithm’s accuracy in simulation and phantom
experiments, along with its repeatability in vivo. In Aim 2, we will compare the diagnostic accuracy of the new method
against existing methods, confirming that this solid-fluid mixture framework can similarly discriminate patients with
NPH from healthy controls and those with Alzheimer’s dementia. Finally, using objective measures of gait collected
before and after surgery, we will test the overall study hypothesis that baseline solid matrix stiffness estimates
(accounting for fluid) can predict the degree of gait improvement following shunt placement.
The proposed technology represents a fundamental shift in the field of brain MRE toward biophysically inspired
modeling. Most importantly, the success of this proposal will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of NPH with
the potential to directly impact patient care."

Aortic aneurysm (AA) is an asymptomatic disease with high mortality rate (65% to 85%) if rupture occurs.
Repair through open or endovascular surgery is currently the only therapeutic option for aortic aneurysm. No
drug has been approved for the treatment of this devastating disease. While surgical intervention is effective in
preventing rupture, it is however often associated with surgical complications that result in severe morbidity
and even mortality. Thus, AA is still a life-threatening disease. Unfortunately, the mechanisms underlying
aneurysm development are largely unknown, which is limiting development of medications for treatment of
aneurysms and dissections. This highlights an urgent need for better understanding of aneurysm formation and
progression. PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) is a transcriptional regulator and plays crucial roles in the
determination and development of cells including hematopoietic, cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells.
Prdm16 germline or vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) selective knockouts are embryonic lethal in mice,
highlighting the importance of PRDM16 in the developmental processes of VSMC. It is not yet known whether
PRDM16 in VSMC will affect the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Our preliminary data
indicate that PRDM16 is significantly reduced in aorta of AAA patients and the PRDM16 SNP is associated
with human AA rupture. Tamoxifen-induced VSMC-selective Prdm16 knockout in mice results in a significant
increase in elastin degradation in AAA lesions. These data suggest that loss of PRDM16 function promotes
AAA formation. We further uncovered that PRDM16 negatively regulates expression of transforming growth
factor β (TGF-β) and A disintegrin A metalloprotease 12 (ADAM12) in VSMC. TGF-β induces ADAM12
expression which is positively correlated with cell apoptosis. Additionally, conjugated linoleic acid (cLA) is an
omega-3 derivative that serves as the preferential endogenous substrate of nitration. Interestingly, oral delivery
of cLA and inorganic nitrite (NO2) yields endogenous nitrated cLA (NO2-cLA). NO2-cLA is a next generation
nitro-fatty acid and the most abundant endogenously produced in humans. Our preliminary data document that
NO2-cLA stabilizes PRDM16 protein and protects against AAA formation and progression in vivo. Also, NO2-
cLA inhibits VSMC apoptosis and inflammation, two hallmarks of AAA, in a PRDM16-dependent manner.
Therefore, we will specifically and systematically address the central hypothesis that “endogenous production
of NO2-cLA protects against AAA formation and progression through PRDM16 in VSMC”. The specific aims of
this proposal are to: 1) determine that PRDM16 in VSMC prevents AAA formation and progression; 2)
determine that PRDM16 protects against VSMC dysfunction through inhibition of TGF-β/ADAM12 signaling;
and 3) determine that endogenous production of NO2-cLA protects against AAA through PRDM16 in VSMC.
This work will define PRDM16 as a novel therapeutic target for AAA and establish the basis to develop a
feasible new oral therapeutic approach.."

Some of the best drugs to study and to treat pain and other nervous system disorders originate in the diverse
chemistry made by animals and their microbiomes. These chemicals evolved to mediate interactions between
animals, often triggering very precise responses in animal neurons. In particular, sensory neurons are major
targets because they provoke an almost immediate behavioral reaction from the receiving animal. In humans,
the somatosensory nervous system is a major target for drugs to treat pain and other nervous system
disorders.
Here, we seek to understand how natural compounds from animals and the animal microbiome mediate
somatosensory signaling. We will interrogate this problem at the level of individual subclasses of neurons. The
sensory system encodes many distinct cell types, each of which is responsible for a very specific type of
sensation. For example, there are several different types of neurons that sense different kinds of heat, cold,
pain, touch, itch, and bodily position. By applying neuroactive ligands to these natural mixtures of sensory
cells, we are able to immediately visualize compounds that target just a single subset of cells, such as those
responsible for mechanical or cold pain. In turn, those ligands may provide good drugs or drug leads to
mediate the chronic pain conditions that are primarily caused by damage to those neurons.
This project will map the functional pharmacology of neurons responsible for sensation, with a focus on pain
sensation and central control of pain. At the same time, we will discover new ligands with potential application
as tool compounds or as new therapies for chronic pain and other neurological diseases. To do so, our specific
aims are to: 1) Discover ligands that target specific cell types in the sensory neurons; 2) Test the therapeutic
efficacy of ligands by strategically selecting animal models of disease; and 3) Characterize the physiological
targets and off-targets of test compounds in synergy with medicinal chemistry."

One major obstacle in treating spinal cord injury (SCI) is to replenish neurons that are lost during the course of
injury and to restore local neuronal circuitry for functional repair. Stem cell transplantation therapy once showed
great promise. However, its efficacy has not been satisfactory in clinical trials; immunorejection and ethical issues
remain problematic. In vivo reprogramming is emerging as a potentially new breakthrough in regenerative
medicine. This innovative technology literally converts endogenous glial cells into functional neurons for repair
purposes, bypassing the challenging questions that stem cell replacement therapies are facing. Previous
research from the PI’s lab has demonstrated that reactive astrocytes can be successfully converted in situ into
functional neurons in both injured brain and brain of a model for Alzheimer’s disease by overexpression of a
single transcription factor NeuroD1 (Guo et al, 2014; BEST of 2014 Article in Cell Stem Cell). However, molecular
mechanisms of the reprogramming process remain elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs
that play pivotal roles during neural development and diseases. The function of miRNAs could be extensive
given that one miRNA may regulate many target genes through the unique imperfect base-pairing mechanism
exerting a global impact on the gene expression profile in a cell. In this proposal, the PI will combine his expertise
on SCI and miRNA, and examine miRNA function during NeuroD1-mediated neuronal conversion in a mouse
model of SCI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that miRNAs play essential roles during the neuronal
reprogramming process, and that forced expression of miRNAs, as well as NeuroD1, can reprogram reactive
astrocytes into neurons for functional repair after SCI. The PI proposes three specific aims: 1) To determine
miRNA function during NeuroD1-mediated neuronal conversion in the injured spinal cord; 2) To determine
conversion of reactive astrocytes into neurons by miRNAs after SCI; 3) To determine functional integration of
miRNA-converted neurons and their effects on animal’s behavior after contusive SCI. Completion of this proposal
will show feasibility of miRNA-mediated glia-to-neuron conversion and lay out foundation for therapeutic
application of this small RNA molecule as a synthetic drug in the future. The PI believes that this proposal will
lead to a novel therapeutic treatment for SCI as well as other neurological disorders."

 Fluorination of an organic compound affects physicochemical properties, which in medicinal settings perturbs
pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, distribution, and/or metabolic profiles both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the
ability to selectively install fluorinated groups under mild conditions is essential for accessing new therapeutics
and biological probes. However, the unique physical properties of fluorinated substrates and/or reagents typically
perturb fundamental organic reactivities, which can complicate synthetic sequences to access fluorinated

we develop fluorination and fluoroalkylation methodologies using innovative strategies (e.g. electrochemistry, C–
H functionalization, deoxyfluoroalkylation, transition metal catalyzed reactions) that enable synthetic chemists to
convert simple and readily available functional groups (e.g. alcohols, carbonyls, fluorinated alkenes) into a broad

fluorinated substructures react through distinct mechanisms and/or deliver products with distinct selectivities
relative to analogous reactions of nonfluorinated substrates. Development of the proposed strategies will enable
medicinal chemists to access new and unique biological probes and therapeutics. A second long-term goal is to
explore physicochemical perturbations imparted by fluorinated substructures that might influence drug stability,
distribution, metabolism, and/or ligand-protein interactions, and to apply such principles in the design of next-
generation fluorinated therapeutic candidates with improved drug-like properties. In the next phase of our work,

This K08 proposal outlines the plan for Kale Bongers, M.D. Ph.D.’s to complete training toward his long-term
goal of improving our understanding of post-sepsis muscle atrophy and weakness through investigation of the
microbiome. Dr. Bongers is a physician-scientist in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at the University of
Michigan with an established record of success in skeletal muscle biology and microbiome studies. This
proposal builds on Dr. Bongers’ previously acquired skillset in skeletal muscle biology, critical illness
pathophysiology, and microbial ecology with new training in metabolomics and metagenomics. These skills will
be integrated to improve our understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in mediating skeletal muscle
atrophy after sepsis. This research will be conducted under the guidance of mentor Robert Dickson, M.D., co-
mentor Kathleen Stringer, Pharm.D., and an advisory board of renowned investigators with experience in
metabolomics, microbial ecology, microbiome studies, skeletal muscle in critical illness, and sepsis
pathophysiology. The five-year plan includes intensive mentorship, formal didactic coursework, professional
development, and increasingly independent research, with milestones to encourage productive research output
and transition to independence. Sepsis is a common and deadly condition of organ dysfunction and immune
dysregulation secondary to infection that often leaves its survivors severely debilitated due to muscle atrophy.
Studies have suggested that the gut microbiome plays a critical role in the regulation of skeletal muscle size
and strength, but to date no study has evaluated the role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of post-
sepsis skeletal muscle atrophy. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the gut microbiome plays a critical role
in post-sepsis skeletal muscle atrophy via two specific Aims. Aim 1 will identify the key bacterial taxa that
contribute to or prevent muscle atrophy in multiple models of murine sepsis, while Aim 2 will identify key
bacterially-derived metabolites that mediate these changes in muscle. To accomplish these Aims, Dr. Bongers
will leverage both in vivo and in vitro models of skeletal muscle with cutting-edge techniques in metabolomics
and metagenomics to identify and mechanistically interrogate how gut bacteria influence skeletal muscle size
and function during sepsis. This will lay crucial groundwork for future R01 proposals to 1) determine whether
supplementation of key bacteria or key bacterially-derived metabolites can prevent skeletal muscle atrophy and
2) translate these findings to humans using morphomics and pre-existing bacterial swabs. In addition to
building a strong line of research to understand the role of the microbiome in muscle atrophy, this proposal will
provide Dr. Bongers with new research skills applicable to microbiome and metabolomics research. This K08
award will enable Dr. Bongers to establish himself as an independent physician-scientist and rising leader in
this important field."
10885971,"Checkpoint blockade antibodies targeting PD-1 have demonstrated improved survival in metastatic head and
neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) patients by reactivating effector T cells that have infiltrated the
tumor microenvironment. However, PD-1 blockade still has low overall response rates approximating 18%,
suggesting that the different treatment outcomes are due to intrinsic differences in the patients' diseases, such
as tumor microenvironments. Recently, we have developed a new class of radioenhancers, nanoscale metal-
organic frameworks (nMOFs), that can alter the immune microenvironment. Constructed via coordination
between hafnium-oxo clusters and porphyrin-like molecules, nMOFs generate both hydroxyl radicals and
singlet oxygen in a process termed radiotherapy-radiodynamic therapy (RT-RDT). The objective in this
application is to define the mechanisms by which RT-RDT and nMOF-enabled immunotherapy alter the
immune microenvironment in order to sensitize HNSCCs to checkpoint blockade. Our central hypothesis is
that nMOFs can deliver the CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and synergize with RT-RDT-induced antigen release
and Type I IFN expression, which stimulates CD8+ and CD4+ T cell proliferation and infiltration into HNSCCs to
regress both irradiated and non-irradiated tumors treated with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. The goal for this
proposed research is to identify a novel therapy and define the mechanisms by which it alters the immune
microenvironment to sensitize HNSCCs and possibly other cancers to current clinical immunotherapies. This
project will use innovative molecularly tunable nMOFs having unprecedented radioenhancement via the unique
RT-RDT mechanism. This proposal is significant because it addresses an unmet need of treating radioresistant
and metastatic HNSCCs both directly via RT-RDT and by acting as an immunostimulant to enhance the
efficacy of existing checkpoint inhibitors. This proposal will test the central hypothesis by pursuing four specific
aims: (1) define the cellular mechanisms of innate immune activation after RT-RDT; (2) determine how RT-
RDT affects the tumor microenvironment in squamous cell cancers; (3) evaluate the contributions of different
immune components on the efficacy of RT-RDT and immunotherapy combinations; and (4) determine effective
therapies for HNSCCs resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Aim 1 will treat cells and ex vivo stimulated or
cultured immune components with nMOFs and radiation to determine how RT-RDT initiates STING and Type I
interferon signaling in the tumor microenvironment. Aim 2 will determine how the tumor microenvironment and
extracellular matrix are affected by nMOF-mediated RT-RDT. Aim 3 will evaluate the contribution of different
immune components to the anticancer efficacy of nMOFs. Aim 4 will use primary oral tumor models that are
resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade as a model to identify novel immunotherapy combinations that synergize
with RT-RDT. Ultimately, this project will afford new therapeutic strategies using clinically relevant
nanomedicines to enhance both the radiation therapy and immunological rejection of HNSCCs."

Despite recent advances in the development and testing of novel therapies for Autosomal Polycystic Kidney
Disease (ADPKD), additional translational and clinical investigations are needed to better elucidate the
mechanisms of disease progression and identify promising new therapies. The overall goals of the Maryland
PKD Research and Translation Center Clinical and Translational Core are to create a robust platform to
support clinical and translational investigation of human ADPKD, through the comprehensive phenotyping of
ADPKD patients linked to a complete biorepository including human tissue samples and cell cultures, and
prospectively ascertained PKD-related outcomes. We propose to develop:
 1) A prospective observational study of N=200 ADPKD patients with comprehensive phenotyping, linked
to a robust specimen biorepository, along with targeted plasma- and urine-based biomarker
measurement and deep genotyping with whole exome sequencing.
2) A human ADPKD human tissue bank in collaboration with our Cell Culture and Engineering Core,
 comprising nephrectomy specimens with cyst-specific tissue samples, cyst fluid, and primary and
 immortalized cell cultures, linked to clinical phenotyping.
3) An electronic ADPKD patient registry, to promote the rapid and efficient screening and recruitment of
 APKD patients for clinical trials and ancillary observational studies.
These resources will be promoted to and shared with new and established investigators in collaboration
with the Administrative Core and the PKD Central Coordinating Site (CCS). We will further collaborate with
investigators in the discovery and validation of novel biomarkers of ADPKD severity and progression, using
our robust biorepository and biomarker laboratory facilities."

 The overall goals of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) Cancer Molecular
and Functional Imaging (CMFI) Program are to develop and apply multimodality molecular and functional
imaging in cancer discovery and the tumor microenvironment; to identify novel imaging-based targets and
advance their translational applications in biomarkers, drug development and theranostics; and to develop
artificial intelligence approaches in analyzing images and spectra for diagnosis and prognosis, and for
precision medicine. To achieve these overall goals, the CMFI Program has the following four aims that focus
on Cancer Discovery and the Tumor Microenvironment, Imaging Agent Development for Detection and
Theranostics, Biomarkers and Evaluation of Therapies, and Artificial Intelligence. Aim 1: To use multi-
modality molecular and functional imaging to understand cancer and the tumor microenvironment, including
the immune microenvironment; Aim 2: To integrate chemistry and molecular biology with imaging to develop
novel imaging probes with an emphasis on clinical translation and theranostics; Aim 3: To develop
noninvasive biomarkers to allow early identification of cancer, predict risk, assist in the selection of
treatment, and detect response. Aim 4: To develop artificial intelligence (AI) approaches applied to image
reconstruction and imaging data. We developed Aim 4 as a new aim in the CMFI Program. The four Aims
are inter-related within the CMFI Program and highly interactive with other Programs, such as Cancer
Genetics and Epigenetics, Cancer Immunology, and Cancer Invasion and Metastasis.
 The CMFI Program consists of 31 Program full members, 18 of whom have cancer-relevant peer-
reviewed funding, and an additional nine associate members. The Program has members with appointments
in four departments across two schools at Johns Hopkins. The total direct cancer-relevant peer-reviewed
funding is $8.2 million, with $6.9 million from the National Cancer Institute. The total number of publications
by Program members since last review is 400, of which 130 (32.5%) are Intra-Programmatic, 147 (36.8%)
are Inter-Programmatic and 231 (57.8%) have external collaborations. Of these publications, 10.5% are in

10886636,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The goal of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) Cancer Prevention and Control
Program is to improve the understanding of cancer risk factors, improve cancer detection and improve
outcomes in cancer patients to reduce cancer burden in the population. To accomplish this goal, the Program
is organized around three specific aims across the cancer control continuum and uses population, translational
and basic cancer prevention sciences approaches: 1) to discover cancer risk factors and to develop and test
primary prevention strategies to mitigate their impact in the catchment area and beyond; 2) to evaluate the
clinical and public health implementation of genomic and other tools to enable early detection of cancers and
their precursors in populations; and 3) to develop and test intervention strategies to intercept precancer or
mitigate the sequelae of cancer in survivors. By liaising with Community Outreach and Engagement, we
prioritize research areas and disseminate findings throughout our catchment area and beyond. The Program's
portfolio of research directly addresses the major cancer problems in the SKCCC catchment area and
elsewhere. Special emphasis is placed on racial and other disparities in cancer burden, and cancers in other
key catchment area populations, particularly those living with HIV. Led by Alison Klein, Ph.D.; Elizabeth Platz,
Sc.D.; and Richard Roden, Ph.D., the Program consists of 41 Full Members, 33 of whom have peer-reviewed
funding, and an additional 14 Associate Members. The Program has Members with appointments in 16
departments and three schools. Total direct cancer-relevant, peer-reviewed funding is $12.9 million, with $6.9
million from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The total number of Program publications is 930, of which 183
(19.7%) are Intra-Programmatic and 314 (33.8%) are Inter-Programmatic. Of these publications, 654 (70.3%)
are multi-institutional collaborations. 18.3% are in journals with an impact factor ≥10, and 5.7% have an impact
factor ≥25. The Program has led to practice-changing, paradigm-shifting and policy-altering research, including
discovering links between periodontal disease and cancer; testing a blood-based early detection tool,
DETECT-A, in 10,000 cancer-free women; developing and testing therapeutic HPV vaccines; and creating and
evaluating the use of a multiparameter test for management of pancreatic cysts. We uncovered the impact of
social determinants of health, including financial toxicity, on cancer survivors and conducted interventional
studies for lifestyle factors, such as obesity and smoking, that contribute to poor health and disparities in
cancer survivorship. These efforts reflect our research mission to inform population-based cancer prevention
and control at the local, state, national and international levels. Program Leaders promote and organize Intra-
and Inter-Programmatic research collaborations to enable appropriate and efficient translation of promising,
novel cancer prevention and control measures, and to secure funding from multiproject grants, such as the
Gastrointestinal and Cervical Cancer SPOREs."
10886638,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The major goals of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) Cancer Chemical and
Structural Biology (CCSB) Program are to: 1) discover, validate and characterize novel molecular targets for
prospective therapeutic agents against human cancers; 2) identify and optimize new small molecules with
anticancer potential; and 3) provide tools for targeting and assessing therapeutic delivery. To achieve these
goals, CCSB fosters significant interactivity among its 31 Program Members and other SKCCC Members. The
program is composed of 31 Members (28 Full Members and three Associate Members) (Table 1), across
twelve departments and four schools. Of the 31 members, 26 have cancer-relevant peer-reviewed funding.
The program brings together cross-disciplinary expertise throughout the university, including the School of
Medicine, the Whiting School of Engineering, the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the Krieger School
of Arts and Sciences. The total direct cancer-relevant peer-reviewed funding is $8.9 million (Data Table 2A),
with $2.1 million from the National Cancer Institute. The success of CCSB is evidenced by a robust pipeline of
over 19 novel lead compounds in various stages of preclinical (14) and clinical (five) development. The
scholarship, including 355 publications, demonstrates broad interactions of which 46 (13%) were Intra-
Programmatic, 162 (45.6%) were Inter-Programmatic and 244 (68.7%) were external collaborations. Activities
for the next project period focus on three synergistic aims:
 Aim 1: To accelerate anticancer target discovery and validation.
Aim 2: To develop novel small-molecule screening platforms, and identify and optimize novel compounds
against cancer targets.
 Aim 3: To develop methods for monitoring, predicting and optimizing anticancer drug delivery and
immunomodulation.
 Aim 1 uses discovery-driven approaches to identify and validate targets along with proof-of-principle
experiments to assess merit and feasibility for translational approaches. These activities include molecular,
structural and cell biology studies, coupled with biological and preclinical therapeutic studies, and
pharmacokinetic analyses. Aim 2 is focused on developing new small-molecule libraries and screening both
existing and novel chemical libraries against identified cancer targets. Aim 3 centers on developing new
methods for small-molecule and nucleic acid delivery (prodrugs, encapsulation methods), and for antibody
design and use (immunoengineering). CCSB efforts will provide new preclinical drug candidates, along with the
biology of pertinent molecular targets. These will support clinical translation and development by investigators
across all SKCCC Programs. CCSB deliverables will have a broad and powerful impact on translational and
clinical research, expediting basic science discoveries to promote the development of new cancer therapeutics."
10885708,"Project Summary/Abstract
 This project will focus on chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans (CS GAGs), a class of
polysaccharides that plays important roles in development, immunity, viral invasion, cancer, and central
nervous system (CNS) injury. CS GAGs undergo spatiotemporally regulated sulfation, giving rise to
diverse regiospecific sulfation patterns. However, efforts to identify functions for specific sulfation motifs
have been hampered by the structural complexity of CS GAGs and a lack of tools to study them. In this
grant, we will combine the power of organic chemistry and neurobiology to overcome these challenges
and identify novel functions for specific motifs in the CNS. The broad objectives of this program are
to: (1) advance a fundamental understanding of the structure-function relationships of CS
GAGs; (2) identify new functions for specific CS sulfation motifs in the brain, building on our
recent discoveries in neuroplasticity, memory, remyelination and immunity; and (3) develop new
chemical approaches to study and manipulate GAG-mediated processes, with the goal of
reducing neuroinflammation and stimulating plasticity and neuronal repair.
 During the last granting period, we developed new chemical tools to modulate specific GAG
sulfation motifs and generated conditional knockout mice lacking the CS-A and CS-E motifs in the
brain. Our studies revealed exciting new functions for CS 4-O-sulfation in the regulation of perineuronal
nets (PNNs), specialized ECM structures that restrict plasticity, and social memory. We also found that
the CS-E motif contributes to neuroinflammation and axon remyelination.
 In the present grant, we will build on these exciting findings and continue to develop new
molecules for manipulating CS sulfation (Aims 1a, 1b, and 3b) and ECM remodeling (Aim 1). Using
these approaches, we will study how CS sulfation regulates signaling pathways important for excitatory
synaptogenesis (Aim 2a). We will also investigate the impact of CS sulfation on the polarization of
immune cells toward pathogenic phenotypes that drive neuroinflammation (Aim 3a) and the maturation
of cells critical for axon remyelination (Aim 4a). Finally, we will explore the potential to use our sulfation
and ECM remodeling agents to control PNNs, attenuate neuroinflammation, and promote remyelination
(Aims 2b, 3b, and 4b). These studies are expected to advance a fundamental understanding of GAGs
and expand current paradigms for how CS GAGs are viewed, demonstrating that specific motifs act as
sequence-specific ligands and actively regulate processes important for neurodegenerative diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. If successful, these studies could ultimately identify
novel therapeutic targets or strategies for stimulating synaptic plasticity and neuronal repair."
10885707,"Project Summary/Abstract: Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome (INS) is the most common type of nephrotic
syndrome in childhood, yet its cause remains unknown. Most authorities consider the disease to be mediated
by an unknown circulating factor that directly binds the podocyte, causing podocyte activation and proteinuria.
However, our group has shown that the disease may not be that simple and that there is also injury to the
glomerular endothelial cells (GEnC) that line the inside of the capillary. We recently showed evidence of
circulating endothelial biomarkers in ~90% of INS patients. In preliminary studies, we found that one specific
endothelial protein, CD93, was especially important, which may relate to its ability to activate focal adhesion
kinase (FAK), a protein that is activated in INS and causes podocyte injury. We found high CD93 expression in
GEnC from kidney biopsies of INS patients and that levels of its soluble form were high in serum and urine in
~90% of ~300 patients. We also found that sera in relapse stimulate cultured GEnC to release CD93; and
importantly, that activation of podocytes by relapsing sera could be blocked with an antibody to CD93. Our
preliminary work also identifies urinary CD93 as predictor of kidney disease progression. Our data suggest that
the pathogenesis of INS involves an intermediary step of GEnC activation that facilitates podocyte injury.
Our central hypothesis is that circulating factors activate GEnC to release the soluble form of CD93, which, in
turn, acts as (1) a predictive biomarker for kidney disease progression, and (2) mediator of podocyte activation
via FAK signaling. In aim 1, we will study whether CD93, in glomeruli, urine or serum, predicts clinical outcomes
and associates with structural and/or biological changes affecting glomeruli. This will be complemented by pilot
studies to delineate the patterns of soluble CD93 across disease states, and its specificity across glomerular
diseases. In aim 2, we will combine multiple in vitro approaches to identify the source of soluble CD93 and its
effects on human podocytes. In aim 3, we will study the CD93 involvement in 2 classic animal models of INS
(puromycin and adriamycin), and whether CD93 blockade prevents and/or mitigates proteinuria.
Our hypothesis is innovative because GEnC are not considered to have an important role in INS. The
combination of several approaches to assess endothelial injury and the inclusion of a large population
provide rigor to the clinical studies. Integrating multiple cell systems and classic models of INS also provide
a rigorous approach to test causality. Our proposal is highly translational and could lead to the identification
of a novel prognostic and therapeutic target in INS. A four-year mentored career development plan has also
been devised, which incorporates training in endothelial biology, precision medicine, and leadership by an
experienced mentoring and advisory teams. The candidate’s long-term career goal is to become an
independent investigator discovering biomarkers, mechanistic pathways, and targeted therapies in INS."
10882230,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Disease ruling, that is, ruling-out or ruling-in, is a main objective of cancer diagnosis to aid in medical decision
making. Taking prostate cancer as our primary example, treatment of intermediate and high risk, early stage
prostate cancer has shown survival beneﬁts, but not so for low risk cancer. Meanwhile, prostate cancer screen-
ing via prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) testing has led to excess unnecessary prostate biopsies and over-detection
of low risk cancer. New strategies are urgently needed for diagnosing aggressive cancer, while avoiding un-
necessary prostate biopsies and over-treatment of indolent cancer. Ruling out or ruling in aggressive prostate
cancer at various clinical decision points in patient care are thus essential. However, the lack of a robust ana-
lytic framework and methodology for disease ruling is one major roadblock. To address this pressing analytic
need, this project will develop a novel performance metric directly tied to clinical utility so as to establish an
analytic paradigm for disease ruling. Furthermore, robust and efﬁcient statistical and computational methods
will be developed for the formulation and simultaneous performance estimation of multiplex diagnostic rules.
Five speciﬁc aims will be pursued. Aim 1 will focus on the conceptual development of the proposed analytic
paradigm as well as disease ruling methods with single predictors. Aim 2 considers disease ruling with multiple
predictors where these predictors are combined via a standard procedure, e.g., logistic regression. Aims 3 and 4
investigate multiplex disease ruling via empirical optimization in linear and Boolean classes, respectively. As
Aims 1–4 target either ruling-out or ruling-in, Aim 5 investigates simultaneous ruling-out and ruling-in. These
proposed analytic methods will be thoroughly investigated through rigorous asymptotic studies and extensive
simulations. They will be applied to a number of our prostate cancer biomarker studies, which motivated this
project, from the National Cancer Institute's Early Disease Research Network (EDRN). User-friendly computer
software will be made available to the research community. These proposed methods will facilitate more effective
and clinically relevant diagnostics research for cancers as well as other diseases."
10881026,"Project Summary
Methods to characterize patients who highly beneﬁt on multiple clinical outcomes, from treatments in Alzheimer's
disease and related dementias (ADRD), are necessary to treat patients effectively. Treatments may beneﬁt some
patients on targeted outcomes, but harm some patients on other, e.g., cognitive, outcomes. So, characterizing
patients who highly beneﬁt on multiple outcomes is signiﬁcant: ﬁrst it allows these patients to choose a treatment
if it is predicted to give them high beneﬁts without the harms; second, accurate characterization methods do not
exist. Generally, a characterization method has two stages. One stage “constructs” outcome predictions based
on patients' covariates; and another stage “synthesizes” the predictions to estimate the goal - a large high beneﬁt
group. As the “construction” stage uses many covariates, it needs methods to estimate predictions from a model,
i.e., from a large set of possible distributions (e.g., regression, neural networks). These predictions are then used
in the “synthesis” stage for the goal. Such existing methods, however, do not use the clinical goal (to characterize
high-beneﬁt patients) as a guide inside the construction stage. For a single outcome, recent work has shown that
this lack of linking can produce dramatically inaccurate characterizations, no matter the model.
 For characterizing patients with multiple high beneﬁts, new methods must explicitly link all multiple clinical
goals (i.e. high beneﬁts in all outcomes) in the construction stage. In preparatory work, we showed that existing
methods for multiple outcomes, can miss even most of the high beneﬁt patients, and we developed a preliminary
better method by establishing the missing links. This new project is motivated by our ongoing work with two
studies. The ﬁrst study tested if citalopram reduces agitation in Alzheimer's patients. Since citalopram may harm
cognitive function, we set to characterize patients with high citalopram effect in (a) reducing agitation and (b)
maintaining cognitive function. The second study tests the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation on
primary progressive aphasia outcomes, with related goals. In preparatory work, we found strong evidence that
standard methods miss up to 70% of the patients with multiple high beneﬁts, compared to the new methods. For
this project we propose to fully develop methods to characterize patients who highly beneﬁt on multiple outcomes.
The methods will be applied to the above studies, and can help more generally in other ADRD studies.
Aim 1. Develop methods to characterize patients who highly-beneﬁt in multiple outcomes in randomized
trials. These methods are signiﬁcant because they allow accurate personalized treatment choices.
Aim 2. Develop methods to ﬁnd if a simpler subset of the full multiple outcomes, can have similar patient
characterization as the full outcomes. These methods are signiﬁcant because they can suggest if a high-effect
on earlier outcomes is necessary before a high-effect on the later outcomes occurs.
Aim 3. Develop methods to characterize patients who highly beneﬁt in multiple outcomes in observational
studies. These methods are signiﬁcant when randomization is infeasible."
10881025,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Despite the availability of current biologics, such as anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF), anti-integrins,
anti-interleukins, and small molecules such as tofacitinib, the rates of primary and secondary treatment failure
remain high in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This highlights the unmet need for the identification of
rational combinations of therapies for IBD with complementary mechanisms of action. Dual targeting of cluster
of differentiation 28 (CD28) and inducible T cell costimulation (ICOS), closely related costimulatory molecules
that play partially overlapping roles in the pathogenesis of IBD, has revealed remarkable success as a potential
therapeutic strategy for IBD as well as other inflammatory diseases. However, dual CD28/ICOS blockade is
currently restricted to protein-based therapeutics associated with unwanted immunogenicity and an increased
risk of adverse events (AEs). In comparison to therapeutic proteins, small molecules will minimize the
immunogenicity risk and enable better management of AEs based on their amenability for pharmacokinetic
optimization. However, there are no small molecules in existence that target ICOS or CD28. To fill this gap, we
have developed an innovative platform, Small Molecules from Antibody Pharmacophores (SMAPs), that can
identify small molecule inhibitors of immune cell receptors with high binding affinity and selectivity. Our SMAPs
platform is based on utilizing cocrystal structures of immune cell receptors with antibodies (Abs) in building
pharmacophore maps from clusters of key interacting residues of Abs with immune cell receptors to identify
small molecules that function as Ab-mimetics. Building on our successful work in drugging immune cell
receptors with small molecule inhibitors, we propose to perform preclinical validation of small molecule-based
dual CD28/ICOS inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for IBD based on small molecule CD28 and ICOS
inhibitors identified from the SMAPs platform. We hypothesize that small molecule-based dual CD28/ICOS
inhibition will result in improved therapeutic outcomes in preclinical models of IBD in comparison to single-
targeted CD28 and ICOS small molecules. We will test our hypothesis and attain our objective via the following
specific aims: (1) optimization of small molecule CD28 inhibitors, followed by validation using biophysical
screening and cell-based assays, (2) assessment of the pharmacokinetic profiles of the optimized CD28 leads,
followed by preclinical validation of small molecule-based dual CD28/ICOS blockade using clinical samples
from IBD patients as well as a mouse T cell transfer model of chronic colitis. Collectively, the proposed
investigations have the potential to identify clinically translatable CD28 inhibitors that can be used in
combination therapy for IBD with small molecule ICOS inhibitors. Successful completion of this work will
enable the initiation of Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies for the optimized therapeutic leads."

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a severe vascular disease affecting millions of Americans with high
morality. Currently, no medication has been approved to treat this devastating disease. Women are less and
later to develop AAA than men. Nevertheless, AAA in women is more aggressive. It grows faster. It is more
likely to rupture at smaller diameters, resulting in higher mortality, with worse morbidity after surgical repair.
Smoking promotes AAA in both men and women, but women who smoke are at higher risk for AAA than men.
Estrogen (E2) has long been believed to protect premenopausal women from AAA. However, its effect on AAA
in animal models and human clinical trials is controversial. Several AAA animal models have been developed
and have contributed to our current understating of AAA. However, one of the common limitations of these
animal models is to use young animals to study AAA, which occurs mainly in older people. To fill this significant
gap, we developed a relatively new AAA mouse model that requires using older male mice, activation of
mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) by aldosterone (Aldo), and high salt intake to induce AAA. Surprisingly, we
found that Aldo and salt (Aldo-salt) only induced AAA in male mice but not in female mice unless female mice
were subjected to ovariectomy (Ovx) or nicotine. Mechanistically, MR was upregulated by Aldo-salt with Ovx or
nicotine in endothelial cells (EC) in the aorta with accumulation in the nucleus, indicating E2 may protect
female mice from AAA via suppressing MR expression and/or nuclear translocation in EC in the aorta.
Interestingly, Per2, a core circadian gene, interacts with ER and MR and is required for E2 to suppress MR
expression. Moreover, genetic deletion of MR in EC, but not smooth muscle cell and myeloid cells, inhibited
Aldo-salt-induced AAA, concordant with a reduction in ICAM1 upregulation in EC and neutrophil (N)
infiltration in the aorta. Based on the literature and robust evidence from our preliminary data, we hypothesize
that E2 inhibits Aldo-salt-induced MR protein upregulation and nuclear translocation via ER/Per2/MR
interaction in EC in the aorta, thus protecting female mice from ICAM1 upregulation, Nφ infiltration, and aortic
aneurysm. Aim 1 is to define the mechanism by which E2 protects Aldo-salt-induced aortic aneurysm by
inhibiting MR protein upregulation and nuclear translocation via ER in EC in the aorta in female mice with Ovx
and nicotine; Aim 2 is to determine whether targeting the Per2/MR/ICAM1/Nφ signaling can protect female
mice with Ovx or nicotine from Aldo-salt-induced aortic aneurysm. To achieve these goals, 12-week-old or 12-
month-old C57BL/6, iECERKO, Per2KO, iECPer2KO, iECMRKO, and WT control female mice will be
subjected to Ovx or nicotine and then treated with E2/progesterone (P4)/dihydrotestosterone (DHT)/ICAM1/
Ly6G antibody (Ab). The effect of hormone therapy, genetic deletion, and Ab blocking on aging/Aldo-salt-
induced AAA will be determined. The proposed studies will shed new mechanistic insight into the pathologies
of AAA in women and provide preclinical evidence to help identify new therapeutic targets against AAA."
10881087,"Instrument Description: Nature’s use of first-row transition metals and single-electron redox means that it
abounds with paramagnetic species amenable to study by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
spectroscopy. The proposed continuous-wave (CW) X-band (9 GHz) EPR system will enable sensitive,
variable-temperature measurements of biomolecules, synthetic mimics, and other samples. It will be housed in
the Texas State University (TXST) Shared Research Operations (SRO), which will maintain the system, bear
ongoing costs, and manage booking/training for TXST and external users at our main campus at San Marcos.
Need: TXST is a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI) with an upward trajectory of research and education in
biomedicine and related disciplines. To support this trajectory, we need a sensitive, temperature-controlled
EPR spectrometer to study biological and synthetic paramagnetic species we encounter. Present TXST
instruments, such as NMR spectrometers and a benchtop EPR spectrometer, cannot provide the information
about these systems that the proposed high-resolution and -sensitivity instrument can afford. Lastly, while
students already receive some hands-on experience with NMR spectroscopy, for students to recognize the
importance of metallocofactors and EPR, students also need hands-on experience with this related technique.
Long-Term Objectives: The EPR spectrometer and its accessories will be housed in a central SRO facility near
many Departments in the TXST College of Science and Engineering, with 24/7 access to trained users. CW-
EPR spectrometers are simple to maintain and we expect smooth operation well beyond the warranty period.
Although our EPR research and teaching will initially feature mostly scientists from the Department of
Chemistry and Biochemistry, a long-term objective is to grow our user base to include those from Biology and
Materials Science programs, as well as off-campus at Star Park, a hub for biotechnology and other start-ups.
Utility in Biomedical Research and Education: The proposed EPR spectrometer will find great utility in the
TXST Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and beyond. For example, the Schilter Group studies
synthetic metal complexes that mimic metalloenzyme active sites, not least those involved in energy
metabolism. These complexes teach us about key intermediates in methane and oxygen processing. Further,
the Peterson Group is characterizing copper uptake in fungal pathogens that rely on copper transport proteins.
With copper being paramagnetic in its divalent state, the proposed EPR will be essential for assessing the
active-site geometry of isoforms and mutants. Lastly, students will experience hands-on EPR spectroscopy —
both data collection and spectral fitting — as part of several undergraduate and graduate courses at TXST."
10870575,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this project is to develop a prototype transplantation technology based on optogenetically controlled
Schwann cells (SCs) and test its efficacy in a rat spinal cord injury (SCI) model. The benefits of using SCs in
improving recovery after SCI are well characterized in animal models, yet they have poorly transferred to clinical
trials. One major shortcoming of applying SCs in humans involves late injection due to the need for lengthy
preparation of autologous SCs. Other major issues concern fast decreases in SC viability and pro-regenerative
capacity following transplantation. We intend to address these deficiencies by engineering SCs with higher
immune tolerance, and enhanced neuroprotective and neurostimulatory properties. These parameters of the
engineered SCs will be controlled with light in the near-infrared window (NIRW) of the spectrum via the recently
engineered bacteriophytochrome-based optogenetic system. The NIRW light penetrates deep into mammalian
tissues, including the spinal cord. Extracorporeal NIRW light-emitting diodes positioned over the skin will keep
engineered SCs in the active state only at the SCI site. Our preliminary results show the feasibility of controlling
gene expression in SCs by a bacteriophytochrome-based gene circuit, and the possibility to deliver NIRW light
to the spinal cords of rats for extended periods of time. In aim 1, we will engineer optogenetic circuits for NIRW
light-inducible expression and secretion of an immunomodulatory cytokine that will dampen the inflammatory
and acquired immune responses thus protecting engineered SCs in the irradiated SCI area. This will allow the
use of allogeneic SCs thus enabling cell transplantation at acute or sub-acute stages of SCI and avoiding the
delay of propagating autologous SCs cells. The engineered SCs will also express, in a light-dependent manner,
a neurotrophic factor that promotes neuronal regeneration. Prior to transplantation, the light-inducible immune
suppressive and pro-regenerative properties of the engineered SCs will be evaluated in syngeneic and
allogeneic co-cultures with immune cells and neurons. In aim 2, we will test performance of the NIRW light-
activated allogeneic SCs in a rat model of contusion SCI. We will assess the abundance, activation and
localization of the transplanted SCs, the immunological environment at the SCI site, and preliminary assess
functional recovery of the animals. This project will be carried out by two research teams with complementary
expertise in NIRW optogenetics, neuronal repair and SCI. The high risk associated with engineering and
application of optogenetically controlled SCs is mitigated by the potential payoff of developing an allogeneic cell
transplantation therapy that can bring the benefits of SCs observed in animal studies to human SCI patients.
Further, the proof of concept that transplanted cells can be controlled with NIRW light at the SCI site will broaden

Sudden, unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a fatal complication, occurring in patients with epilepsy, who
were otherwise healthy. Dravet syndrome (DS), which results from a loss of function of the sodium channel (NaV)
isoform NaV1.1, is associated with a particularly high risk of SUDEP. Notably, the unexpected mortality of SUDEP
mirrors cases of sudden cardiac death (SCD) – unexpected death resulting from cardiac arrhythmias. Emerging
evidence points to physiological commonalities between the brain and the heart, suggesting that the very
molecular mechanisms that underlie epileptic disorders could also directly impact the heart, leading to life-
threatening cardiac arrhythmias and thereby, SCD. However, the precise mechanisms by which DS directly
impact the heart to promote cardiac arrhythmias and SCD remain unknown. Thus, we propose to utilize models
of DS to address this gap in knowledge and to explore the role of direct cardiac remodeling in SCD. Using these
models, we will test the hypothesis that defects in NaVs that underlie inherited epileptic disorders, such as Dravet
syndrome, dysregulate cardiac Na+/Ca2+ cycling, thereby promoting life-threatening arrhythmias and contributing
to SCD. Thus, we propose to: 1) Define the phenotypic and structural impacts of tissue-specific expression of
DS-associated defects. 2) Determine the functional impact of DS-associated Na+/Ca2+ signaling nanodomain
remodeling on cardiac Ca2+ handling. 3) Assess efficacy of targeting Na+/Ca2+ signaling nanodomains for SCD
prevention. Information gleaned from these studies will be used to develop new therapeutic approaches to treat
SCD in DS."

Cellular senescence is considered a “double-edged sword” in cancer and cancer therapy – while senescence-
associated growth arrest and immune stimulation serve as potent anti-tumor mechanisms, chronic
inflammation can be pro-tumorigenic and senescence bypass can contribute to therapy resistance and relapse.
Many clinically used cancer therapies have been shown to trigger cellular senescence in tumor cells, so
understanding the effects of senescent cells on the tumor microenvironment is critical. Gaining a clear
understanding of the mechanism of senescence-inducing therapies will enable their improved clinical use and
increase the likelihood for their success as cancer therapeutics.
There is considerable evidence that senescent cells are proinflammatory and can be surveilled by T cells in
vivo. This proposal will dissect the interplay between senescent cells and T cells in a mouse model of
Hepatocellular Carcinoma in which senescence-induced T cell-mediated tumor regressions have been
observed.
Aim 1. Investigate senescence-induced T cell surveillance of senescent and proliferating tumor cells. I
hypothesize that senescent tumor cells secrete chemokines that promote T cell infiltration and surveillance of
both senescent and proliferating tumor cells.
Aim 2. Identify strategies to potentiate T cell surveillance of senescent tumor cells. I hypothesize that
senescent tumor cells employ resistance programs that diminish T cell recognition or killing.
Validation of the hypotheses set forth in this proposal would have major implications in the fields of
senescence biology and tumor immunology, as well as for the use of senescence-inducing therapies as clinical
cancer therapeutics."

Estimates of suicidal ideation and behaviors (SIBs) amongst adolescents living with HIV (ALWH) in Sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA) range from 18-69%. Despite this significant burden, prevention efforts in the region are
lagging due to a myriad of structural and socio-cultural barriers. This need is particularly dire in Malawi, where
estimates of suicidal ideation amongst ALWH are high, mental health stigma is pervasive, suicide attempts are
criminalized, and psychiatric human resources are limited. Resource appropriate interventions that allow for
the identification, prevention, and management of SIBs amongst ALWH are urgently needed. The Friendship
Bench (FB) is an evidence-based counseling intervention designed to be delivered by trained, lay health
workers. The FB has proven highly effective for addressing common mood disorders such as depression,
which is major determinant of suicidality. Further, the FB has recently been adapted for ALWH in Malawi.
Enhancing FB with evidence-based suicide prevention activities, such as the Safety Planning (SP)
Intervention, may be a feasible and effective opportunity to meet the needs of ALWH with SIBs. SP aims to
reduce acute SIBs through the co-creation of coping strategies which can be utilized in the event of a suicidal
crisis to avert acute suicidal thoughts and manage suicidal urges. As few evidence-based suicide prevention
interventions have been implemented in Africa, SP is ideal for Malawi, given it has been delivered by non-
psychiatric specialists in the region, and can easily be incorporated into existing services to fully address
chronic SIBs. The long-term goal of our research program is to generate and implement an evidence-based
model to prevent suicide in Malawi amongst ALWH through increasing the capacity of the health system to
identify SIBs and provide evidence-based care as well as through enhancing the capacity of research and
policy makers to enact change. Our specific aims are: 1) to enhance the FB model with SP that is adapted to
meet the developmental and contextual needs of ALWH in Malawi through formative research; 2) evaluate the
feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, and preliminary efficacy of the enhanced FB+SP model through a pilot
randomized controlled trial; and 3) enhance capacity of mental health researchers and policy makers to
advocate for legislative change through symposiums, workshops and meetings for multisectoral collaboration.
The proposed aims pave the way for a R01 application to test the enhanced FB+SP intervention in a cluster
randomized controlled trial and represent an important step towards preventing suicide amongst ALWH in
SSA."

Eating disorders (ED) and non-eating disorders internalizing-spectrum disorders (nonED-INT; e.g., major
depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic
stress disorder) have major public health importance due to their prevalence and significant personal and
societal costs. These disorders often onset during adolescence and co-occur. Despite years of psychiatric
research, detection and prevention strategies for ED and nonED-INT are not optimal. Little is understood about
the developmental course of ED and nonED-INT symptoms, particularly their co-development, and the degree
to which shared vs. unique genetic and phenotypic factors underlie ED and nonED-INT risk. In this study, we
will elucidate the taxonomy of ED and nonED-INT symptoms: clarifying their joint (i.e., as an overarching
internalizing dimension) and specific developmental course and identifying genetic and environmental
predictors. We will leverage the rich genomic and phenotypic data from two large and well-characterized
cohorts - the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) and the Avon Longitudinal Study of
Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohorts. We will deliver developmental models of ED and nonED-INT
symptom course, explicate their joint and specific risk (genetic and environmental), and assess differences in
models across samples and race/ethnicities.
We propose three specific aims: First, using ABCD and ALSPAC data, we will empirically identify trajectories
of ED and nonED-INT symptoms across development for each cohort and assess stability of the models
across sex, race, and ethnicity. Second, using multi-trait genomic methods, we identify unique and common
genetic risk across ED and nonED-INT phenotypes. Finally, we will determine genetic and phenotypic
longitudinal predictors of ED and nonED-INT trajectories in each cohort and elucidate the stability and
robustness of a predictive model based on both genetic and early-life risk indicators.
In the short-term, our results will lend clarity to the taxonomy of ED and nonED-INT. In the long-term, improved
understanding of developmental pathways will aid early intervention and identification of high-risk youth."
10884345,"NIH SuRE Project – Abstract
 Heterocycles account for more than 50% of all known organic compounds. Their rich activities in
biological systems are important for pharmaceuticals and natural products. Among the top 200 brand
name drugs, over 75% are heterocyclic compounds. In nature, heterocycles are active components for
defense, communication, and reproduction. Low regioselectivities, low stereo-/enantioselectivities,
lengthy synthetic sequences, and low overall yields in most multi-step syntheses make it extremely
challenging to provide sufficient quantities of desired bioactive heterocycles for therapeutic purposes.
This NIH SuRE proposal aims to develop and utilize highly selective metal catalyzed carbon carbon
bond formation reactions that will lead to efficient synthesis of novel selenium, sulfur, and oxygen-
containing heterocycles with rich biological activities. This proposal also aims to develop
multicomponent coupling processes for rapid generation of functionality and complexity in heterocycles,
a new selective merged asymmetric conjugate addition-acylation as well as a merged conjugate
addition-oxidation strategy that will lead to the synthesis of new classes of bioactive selenium, sulfur-
containing heterocycles. The proposed new C-C bond formations and multicomponent reactions will
provide new opportunities for complex novel heterocycle synthesis. The metal-catalyzed conjugate
addition of nucleophiles onto polyenic Michael acceptors is one of the most attractive and powerful C-C
bond forming strategies for synthesis of relevant molecules, as it provides opportunity for sequential
generation of two or more stereogenic centers in a straightforward fashion. The multicomponent
reactions enabled by direct trapping of metal enolates could provide powerful transformations for the
formation of multiple C-C bonds and chiral centers in a single pot. The resultant versatile heterocyclic
subunits and trapping of the metal enolates in situ will provide excellent opportunities for new innovative
approaches for novel complex heterocyle synthesis and drug discovery. Further elaboration of this
chemistry will likely allow the first enantioselective synthesis of very important classes of heterocycles
such as biselenoflavonoids, bithioflavonoids and bioactive biflavonoids, potential small molecule
therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease. This SuRE project is expected to significantly enhance and
expand the research capacity towards a sustainable research excellence at WSSU, a HBCU."
10881201,"Project Summary
 The requested instrument is a CEM microwave-assisted peptide synthesizer, the Liberty Prime 2.0 HT12
System, which builds up chemical libraries of peptidomimetics and produces small-size enzymes possessing
>100 amino acids. With the aid of microwave heating system, the synthesizer features a short reaction time
alongside a significant reduction of solvent usage and produces the desired products with high yield and purity
for long and complex peptides. In addition, the engineered fluidic deliveries, internal temperature control, resin-
transfer module, and software enhance throughput of synthesis, allowing up to 12 peptides to be queued at a
time. The long-term objective of this application is to develop novel peptidomimetics and macrocyclic hybrids as
therapeutic candidates for human diseases. We will also develop new classes of peptide-based biosensors of
kinase to understand the functional biology of each kinase in living cells using the peptide synthesizer.
 We propose to acquire this instrument to synthesize peptidomimetics, peptide-sensors, and small enzymes
efficiently in a cost-effective, eco-friendly, and educational manner. Our research projects use the traditional
method of solid phase synthesis: using fritted plastic syringes and shakers. However, since the traditional method
has long reaction times (2-3 hours per coupling step) and large amounts of solvents in the washing steps,
progress in producing chemical libraries for the discovery of bioactive agents are currently limited. In addition,
synthesizing long peptide chains with >10 amino acids results in inseparable mixtures and inconsistent results
for many synthesized peptides. Thus, using the automated system will definitely elevate the productivity and
consistency in our research projects. Since the system uses the significantly reduced solvents, it is also ideal for
a resource-limited institution for research.
 Solid phase synthesis of peptides is an appropriate experiment to teach beginners in the lab, and new
students are able to learn basic laboratory skills for their research with minimal training and by following
protocols. In addition, students will learn amide coupling and deprotection reactions and instrumentation for
analysis, purification, and characterization of peptides they synthesized. However, the traditional method
requires excessive time and effort on tedious and repetitive steps such as washing resins with solvents, which
tend to make students more engaged in making chemical agents rather than understanding their biological
effects and learning rationale for improving their activities. Therefore, the automated peptide synthesizer can be
an exemplary instrument to train entry level researchers such as high school and undergraduate students, and
they will learn not only synthesis of peptidomimetics, but also their applications in therapeutic discovery and
biomedical research."

Antibiotics are central to modern medicine and rising antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health.
Identifying new and different drug targets for the development of new antibiotics is crucial to overcome resistance.
Adjuvant strategies that either enhance the activity of existing antibiotics or improve clearance by the host immune
system provide another mechanism to combat antibiotic resistance. Targeting a combination of essential and non-
essential enzymes that play key roles in bacterial metabolism is a promising strategy to develop new antimicrobials
and adjuvants, respectively. The enzymatic synthesis of L-cysteine is one such strategy. Cysteine plays a key role in
proteins and is vital to the synthesis of biomolecules important for defense against the host immune system. In contrast
to mammals, the biosynthesis of cysteine occurs de novo in microbes using sulfide (S2–) as the sulfur source derived
from the reductive sulfate assimilation pathway. Inhibition of sulfate assimilation has been proven to interfere with a
pathogen’s ability to fight oxidative stress, infect the host and establish long-term infection. Inhibition of sulfate assim-
ilation has also been associated with a dysregulated oxidative stress response, enhancing the antimicrobial activity of
existing antibiotics. In previous funding cycles, we have defined the mechanism and structure of mycobacterial 5’-
adenylylsulfate (APS) reductase an iron-sulfur protein that catalyzes the two-electron reduction of APS to sulfite (SO32–
) using thioredoxin (TrxA) as the preferred electron donor. We subsequently used these insights to discover first-in-
class inhibitors of mycobacterial APS reductase (APR), with potent in vivo bactericidal activity against MDR and XDR
clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and synergistic activity with known anti-TB drugs (isoniazid, ri-
fampicin, clofazimine) in killing H37Rv Mtb. In this renewal, we now seek to expand our early focus on cysteine bio-
synthesis and redox metabolism in mycobacteria to pathogens implicated in fatal secondary bacterial infections in
influenza infection, specifically in patients with COVID-19: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Given the importance of microbial sulfur metabolism in oxidative stress resistance and virulence, in this renewal ap-
plication we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Define the mechanistic and structural basis for inhibition of the
Fe-S protein APR from P. aeruginosa; (2) Investigate the effect of P. aeruginosa APR inhibitors on sulfur metabolism
and redox metabolism in cells; (3) Determine whether a virus family that infect S. pneumoniae in human environments
and encode genes for reductive sulfate assimilation increase the fitness of the bacterial host, which lacks this pathway."
10881203,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Given the important roles of tumor suppressors and oncogenes in metabolic reprogramming, there is
significant translational potential in identifying and understanding how particular oncogenotypes influence tumor
metabolism, and whether these changes impose liabilities that can be exploited therapeutically. From more recent
studies, however, a nuanced picture has emerged showing that tissue context impacts the execution of metabolic
reprogramming even with the same oncogenic drivers. For example, despite having the same driver mutations,
pancreatic cancer and lung cancer exhibit differences in branched chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism, where
lung tumors increase BCAA uptake to use them as a nitrogen source while pancreatic tumors decrease BCAA
uptake due to decreased expression of genes in BCAA metabolism compared with normal pancreas. Thus,
understanding how cell-of-origin interacts with genetic events to affect the metabolic dependence of tumors will
be critical for selecting the right treatment approaches for patients.
 By analyzing the metabolome of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples surgically resected
from patients and comparing those with KRAS mutations (K) to those with KRAS/LKB1 co-mutations (KL), we
noted that serine-glycine one carbon (SGOC) metabolism is significantly altered in KL NSCLC, similar to KL
pancreatic cancer models. By further metabolic analyses, however, we clarified the differences in SGOC
metabolism between these two tumor types. While KL pancreatic cancer requires SGOC for DNA methylation,
KL NSCLC depends on SGOC via serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) enzymes to maintain redox
homeostasis. By establishing both molecular and metabolic platforms to measure metabolites involved in redox
balance, and utilizing clinically relevant mouse models for in vivo studies, we are now poised to define the
oncogenic role of SHMTs during lung tumorigenesis.
 In Aim 1 we will interrogate the mechanistic basis of SHMT dependence in these NSCLC cells. In Aim 2
we will investigate the molecular mechanism by which LKB1 regulates SHMT. In Aim 3 we will examine 1)
whether SHMT suppression reduces tumor growth and 2) whether the combination of SHMT inhibition with
chemotherapeutic drugs that induce oxidative stress can further inhibit tumor growth using various mouse models.
While the critical role of SGOC as a methyl group donor for DNA methylation in KL pancreatic cancer has been
reported, the importance of SGOC metabolism in KL NSCLC or heterogeneity between these two diseases has
yet to be elucidated. Our studies will provide valuable information for substratification of NSCLC patients with
hyperactive SGOC metabolism as treatment responders to therapies targeting redox balance, which is pertinent
to the goals of precision medicine."
10880878,"Vision loss in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) results from diabetic retinopathy (DR) which can appear at any retinal
location without warning. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness in working aged Americans but it can be
difficult for clinicians to determine who will start on a path to vision loss and when. There are also millions of
Americans (up to 44% of the population) with prediabetes (PreDM). These patients have impaired fasting
glucose, elevated Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and/or Oral Glucose Tolerance Tests (OGTT). They are at higher
risk for T2DM, and most do not know their diagnosis. There is a major gap in our understanding of how and
when PreDM affects the eye. It is important we close this gap as there are no treatments in the eye outside of
glycemic control for early T2DM and PreDM. Methods for early diagnosis and detection, especially if location-
specific, could aid in delaying DR and over the long term, saving sight. Our long-term goal is to understand
how glucose dysregulation impacts the vascular and neural retina, cornea and tear film. We also seek to
understand if systemic objective phenotypic differences (meaning tests of T2DM health such as fat distribution,
activity levels from accelerometry and OGTT) in these patients are related to or predictive of ocular health. It is
known that current tests of ocular structure and function such as multifocal electroretinograms (mfERG), ocular
coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO),
corneal confocal microscopy and tear composition are altered in early T2DM. However, PreDM has not been
included in this work, and local retinal oxygenation changes have never been evaluated with these other ocular
tests. There is also no knowledge as to which objective systemic and lifestyle factors put the patient most at
risk for ocular changes in PreDM. Our central hypothesis is that local retinal oxygenation is altered by
changes in glucose tolerance. This drives the relationship between vessel changes and retinal function, in local
retinal areas. In Aim 1, a cross sectional study, we will compare subjects in the following groups: controls,
PreDM patients with a wide range of impaired glucose tolerance, T2DM with no DR, and T2DM with DR. We
will also use the best objective measures available to fully phenotype subject characteristics with regards to
factors such as body fat and sedentary lifestyle. We will then evaluate differences between groups for
structural and functional eye testing using the tests above, as well as local oximetry and levels of glucose
impairment to see relationships in systemic and eye health. In Aim 2, we will follow these subjects at 1 and 2
years in a prospective cohort study to see how these phenotypes influence ocular change over time. We also
plan to evaluate the timeline of ocular structure and function changes across the eye. We expect that
differences in impaired glucose tolerance/phenotypes will alter ocular testing over time especially in PreDM.
The ability to predict which areas are most affected and which patients are most at risk, could constitute a
significant advance in diagnosis and management of this disease, which has reached epidemic proportions."
10880817,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Technical advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have led to a wide range of imaging techniques,
contrast mechanisms, and clinical applications. However, despite marked progress in radio-frequency (RF) and
shim coil technologies, the traditional MRI scanner architecture currently used on virtually all scanners still has
major limitations. RF coil arrays require wired connections to the bulky receiver chain in the scanner and the
machine room via bulky cable assemblies, which can result in long setup times, patient discomfort and motion,
lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from crosstalk, loss of transmit power from power dissipation, and RF burns
from induced currents. These issues are further exacerbated with modern high-channel-count or flexible RF
coil arrays. In addition, conventional low-order spherical harmonic shim coils require wired connections to
amplifiers in the machine room and cannot effectively shim localized static magnetic field inhomogeneities
(∆B0) in the human body, leaving artifacts that severely degrade the image quality in many applications.
We previously proposed two coil designs to address some of these limitations: 1) Our novel integrated
RF/wireless (iRFW) coil design enables MR imaging and the wireless transfer of data from/to peripheral
devices with a single coil array for low-throughput applications such as wireless physiological monitoring, but
not yet for the wireless transfer of MRI data, which requires further development; 2) Our integrated parallel
reception, excitation, and shimming (iPRES) coil design enables MR imaging and an effective shimming of
localized B0 inhomogeneities with a single integrated RF/shim coil array. However, such iRFW and iPRES coil
arrays remain limited by the bulky wired connections and receiver chain required to transfer the MRI data.
Our goal is to address these limitations by developing a highly innovative wireless MRI scanner architecture
based on a stand-alone, platform-independent high-channel-count wireless integrated RF/shim coil array with
on-board received chain and cloud-based data processing workflow that will enable wireless MRI and localized
B0 shimming with a single coil array. This paradigm shift in MRI scanner architecture will eliminate all cables
from the coil array and the bulky receiver chain embedded in the scanner, thus drastically reducing the system
complexity, footprint, and cost, while making the entire receiver chain and data processing workflow (including
with third-party advanced reconstruction methods) compatible with scanners from different manufacturers, and
improving the freedom of positioning, patient comfort, safety, SNR, spatial fidelity, image quality, diagnostic
accuracy, and clinical utility for a wide range of MRI applications throughout the human body. Specifically, we
will develop the technology to enable this novel wireless MRI scanner architecture and we will integrate it with
a 48-channel wireless integrated RF/shim head/neck coil array to demonstrate its feasibility and advantages for
human brain imaging, which will open up exciting new avenues for MRI."

 Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT), historically also called hemangiopericytoma (HPC), is a soft-tissue sarcoma
occurring in adults and infants. This nonhereditary cancer is a result of an environmental intrachromosomal
gene fusion between NAB2 and STAT6 on chromosome 12, which fuses the activation domain of STAT6 with
the repression domain of NAB2. Consequently, instead of NAB2 repressing early growth response (EGR-1)
target genes, the fusion protein activates them leading to tumorigenesis. There are at least 6 distinct fusion
variants that account for pathologic variation and tumor aggressiveness in SFTs. Anatomically, these blood
vessel-derived tumors can occur anywhere; however, most occur within the meninges of the head. Intracranial
SFTs have a high rate of local recurrence (65%), metastases (33%) and overall survival less than 10 years.
Either surgery or radiation is the first line of treatment against this cancer, however for many this becomes
challenging as the cancer can travel to inoperable areas or reoccur in locations already irradiated.
 Currently there is no approved chemotherapy regimen for SFTs. Anti-angiogenic drugs developed to
treat other cancers have been used on SFTs with limited success. None of the chemotherapies enables
complete remission, with the best response being a partial response or stable disease for several months. The
average survival of patients on the current chemotherapies is 2 years.
 Using the CRISPR-based genome editing, we established SFT cell models which closely match the
endogenous NAB2-STAT6 genetic characteristics. In addition, we prepared several primary SFT cell lines and
a PDX animal model from resected patient tissue samples that faithfully recapitulates phenotypes of malignant
SFTs. Using these SFT models, we performed a high-throughput assay, which identified the BET inhibitor
Mivebresib as a promising candidate against SFTs. Here, we propose the following three aims: (a) perform
comprehensive phenotypic assays to evaluate the in vitro efficacy and specificity of Mivebresib and additional
BET inhibitors currently in clinical trials against SFTs; (b) uncover the molecular mechanisms of BET inhibitors
in SFTs, with initial focus on DNA damage and repair mechanisms; and (c) evaluate the in vivo safety and
efficacy of BET inhibitors in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) or PARP inhibitors.
 Our scientific approach, which spans cancer biology (in vitro and in vivo) and hypothesis-driven mechanism
studies, will contribute to significant advances in the understanding and treatment of SFTs. Our objective is to
initiate a single-patient Investigational New Drug (IND) clinical trial."
10882022,"Title of project: Developing hemophilia A therapeutics by targeting translational and posttranslational
regulation of FVIII
Abstract: Hemophilia A (HA) is an X-linked inherited disease due to mutations in the gene encoding the blood
coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), which affects 1 in every 5,000 male births. The majority of HA mutations are
nonsense mutations, which introduce premature stop codons leading to no or truncated FVIII protein expression,
and missense mutations, which are marked by excessive misfolding and degradation of FVIII protein. Current
HA treatments include FVIII concentrate or bispecific monoclonal antibody infusions. However, these treatments
are extremely costly and may require frequent office visits. The high cost precludes 80% of the global hemophilia
population from routine access to care. Alternative approaches utilizing small molecule drugs offer several
advantages, including greatly reduced costs and ease of delivery, which can enhance accessibility and patient
compliance. We hypothesize that specific pharmacological molecules can enhance the expression, folding, and
trafficking of certain nonsense and missense mutants, leading to increased coagulation factor levels sufficient to
restore hemostasis. Gene therapy holds promise for a long-term cure for HA. However, FVIII is intrinsically
difficult to express, requiring a high dose of adeno-associated virus (AAV) to produce therapeutic levels of FVIII
in HA patients. A high AAV dose can trigger an immune response against the vector, causing complications and
limiting FVIII expression. We have identified FVIII variants with 6-fold enhanced expression over the currently
used B-domain deleted FVIII. We hypothesize that incorporating these FVIII variants in gene therapy can result
in higher plasma FVIII activity levels with lower viral vector doses, offering a superior alternative to the existing
FVIII variants. In Aim 1, we recently identified compounds that effectively rescue certain nonsense mutations of
FVIII by drug-induced ribosomal readthrough. We will systematically test the most common nonsense FVIII
mutations to identify candidate mutations and sequence patterns that will predict candidate mutations for
effective readthrough therapy. In Aim 2, after screening compound libraries, we identified proteostasis regulators
(PRs) that enhance the secretion of FVIII missense mutants. We will further identify common HA missense
mutations that can be rescued by PRs and their molecular mechanism. We will validate in vitro results of both
aims in mouse models. Aim 3 will further characterize the high-expression FVIII variants and explore the
synergistic effects of combining these variants with existing strategies to boost FVIII expression. The efficacy
and safety of candidate variants will be tested in HA mice through AAV-based gene therapy applications. Taken
together, these studies will validate the use of small-molecule approaches for HA treatment, tailoring them to
each patient's specific mutation profile as effective and convenient treatment options. Our novel high-expression
variants will increase plasma FVIII co-factor activity while requiring lower viral vector doses. This advancement
is crucial in developing a safer and more effective next-generation HA gene therapy approach."

Our long-term objectives are to understand genetic and phenotypic properties that allow the
abundant human gut Bacteroidales species to survive in the host over its lifetime. In this proposal,
we will build upon our work studying antibacterial toxins produced by the gut Bacteroidales that
they use to antagonize other members of ecosystem. We will study important protective
responses mounted by these bacteria upon exposure to antibacterial toxins and other stressors
they encounter in the gut microbiota. We found that the genes of an unusual ECF-type sigma
factor/antisigma factor pair, named EcfO-Reo, are induced upon exposure of Phocaeicola
vulgatus to toxins and other stress-inducing compounds. The ensuing pleiotropic response
protects these bacteria from various stressors that perturb the outer membrane. efcO-reo and the
genes of its regulon are among the most highly expressed in vivo. The genes of this regulon
include those encoding three families of proteins with unknown functions: the NigD proteins, a
family of outer membrane porins, and proteins involved in the synthesis of long LPS. Our
preliminary data suggest that these genes are regulated in different manners and provide distinct
mechanisms of protection. In Aim 1, we will use a transcriptional reporter and phenotypic analyses
to identify microbial, host and abiotic stressors that induce expression of the ecfO-reo operon and
determine if induction of the response protects the bacteria from those stressors. In Aim 2, we will
determine the molecular basis of long LPS (O-antigen) synthesis and the protection it confers to
diverse stressors. In Aim 3, we will use genetic and phenotypic analyses combined with unbiased
approaches to identify the protective functions of the NigD family of proteins. These proteins are
are released in outer membrane vesicles when the EcfO regulon is induced by outer membrane
perturbations. In Aim 4, we will study a family of outer membrane proteins that are highly
upregulated when the EcfO-Reo operon is induced. We will use a combination of techniques to
identify the unique mechanism of regulation and the contribution of these OMPs to the EcfO-Reo-
induced protective response. For all aims, we will study the contribution of the different arms of
the protective response to the fitness of the bacteria in the gnotobiotic mouse gut. The knowledge
gained from this proposal will greatly increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms
that this order of bacteria use to survive in the human gut microbiota when exposed to various
stressors of host, microbial and xenobiotic origin."

Colorectal abnormalities such as pre-cancerous fibrotic disease and colon cancer are prevalent. However, the
mechanisms that link the extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling that occurs during fibrosis to pro-
tumorigenic cell transformation are still poorly understood. Compromised epithelial integrity is a common feature
of these colorectal conditions. Recently, we discovered a mechanism that links epithelial tissue integrity with the
RNA interference (RNAi) machinery, miRNA regulation, and colon cell behavior. We have shown that the
adherens junctions, which is an essential architectural component of the cell, recruit the microprocessor and the
RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC), the core components of the RNAi machinery, as well as a specific set
of miRNAs and mRNAs, in colon epithelial cells. This interaction occurs through PLEKHA7, a member of the E-
cadherin cell-cell adhesion complex. PLEKHA7 loss results in compromised epithelial integrity, decreased levels
and silencing activity of a set of miRNAs, increased oncogene expression and pro-tumorigenic cell
transformation. We have also found extensive dysregulation of PLEKHA7 and of the junctional RNAi machinery
in colon cancer cell lines and tumor patient samples. Colon epithelial tissues undergo abnormal physical stress
during fibrosis and colon cancer due to excessive ECM remodeling, which promotes disease progression.
Interestingly, our preliminary data reveal that application of physical stress to colon epithelial cells through the
ECM results in mis-localization of the junctional RNAi machinery. We also have preliminary evidence that
disruption of the junctional RNAi results in overexpression of ECM remodeling regulators and promotes ECM
remodeling and cell migration. We hypothesize that biomechanical cues from the ECM result in dysregulation of
PLEKHA7 and its associated RNAi machinery at the adherens junctions, promoting oncogene expression, further
ECM remodeling, and pro-tumorigenic cell behavior. We will examine our hypothesis under two specific Aims:
1) Physical cues from the ECM regulate PLEKHA7-RNAi complex formation and function at adherens junctions;
2) PLEKHA7-associated miRNAs regulate ECM remodeling and pro-tumorigenic cell behavior. This study is
significant, since it investigates a novel mechanistic link between physical changes in the ECM, epithelial
integrity, and colon epithelial cell behavior through a localized function of the RNAi machinery. The proposed
work is innovative by introducing the concept of a mechanosensitive RNAi machinery at adherens junctions. The
impact of the study is that it will advance our understanding of the underlying mechanistic causes of intestinal
diseases, particularly those connecting fibrotic conditions to pro-tumorigenic cell transformation. Since this
involves miRNA regulation as the focal point in the crosstalk between ECM and colon cell behavior, the study
can lead to future development of RNA-based therapeutics."

Real-life learning occurs through feedback in the form of reward or punishment. Dopamine is a key molecule in
the brain known to play a central role in learning from rewards. However, the role of these molecules in learning
from punishments, or a combination of positive and negative valence outcomes (i.e., reward and punishment),
has yet to be resolved. Parkinson’s disease and other dopamine-related disorders demonstrate deficits related
to such valence-dependent learning and these have been shown to broadly affect multiple, cognitive and motor,
forms of learning. Dopamine signals related to negative valence have recently been observed in regions lying
outside of well-known reward-related areas in the ventral striatum brain region. Parkinson’s disease is known to
produce a spatial pattern of dopamine loss in the striatum. Thus, I hypothesize that dopamine signals processing
different positive and negative valence information originate in different areas of the striatum to regulate learning.
Tools capable of multi-site recording of dopamine molecules with chronically stable performance are needed to
explore dopamine’s spatially segregated functions in valence-dependent learning. I established the tools needed
to record dopamine from multiple widely distributed sites in the striatum and over prolonged timeframes (> 1
year) to measure throughout the process of learning. Dopamine’s widely established role in learning mainly
comes from measurements in simple associative learning tasks used in rodents, which take less than a day to
learn. Here, the goal is to look at dopamine function during extended forms of learning where behaviors evolve
over the course of months by leveraging the chronic sensors I developed. Furthermore, the effect of valence on
learning has been shown to depend on task demands and complexity. Therefore, an array of learning tasks is
needed to evaluate how dopamine processes the effects of valence on learning. Tasks selected for this proposal
incorporate simple associative learning known to have a strong basis for dopamine, as well as cognitive and
motor forms of learning that are also thought to recruit dopamine based on their observed deficit in Parkinson’s
disease and other dopamine pathologies. Here, I propose to apply my chronic sensors to measure dopamine
across multiple sites in the striatum of monkeys as they learn to perform a variety of tasks probing simple
associative, cognitive, and motor functions, through a combination of positive and negative valence incentives.
Aim 1 will measure dopamine’s spatially segregated functions in valence-dependent associative learning. Aim 2
will identify the valence-specific dopamine signals recruited for more cognitively demanding, category learning.
Aim 3 will distinguish the dopamine signals subserving valence-dependent motor learning. These studies will
expand our knowledge on dopamine’s spatially distributed functions, helping to uncover how these molecules
contribute to learning. Results from the proposed studies may be useful to help identify targets for improving
diagnostics and treatment in Parkinson’s disease and other disorders implicating dopamine dysregulation."
10882036,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although the neuromodulators dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh) are extensively implicated in the
pathogenesis and treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases, their effects on the activity of brain circuits are typically
studied separately, leaving their ability to dynamically cooperate in supporting brain function and dysfunction
incompletely understood. This is a significant limitation as (1) neuropsychiatric disorders typically involve
disturbances in multiple modulators, (2) existing therapies rarely target a single modulatory system, and (3) the
physiological actions of modulators are fundamentally inter-dependent, since many co-exist in individual brain
regions and converge on overlapping cells to stimulate receptors that complement, antagonize, or synergize with
one another. An influential hypothesis in the field of basal ganglia research is that ACh gates or modifies the
physiological actions of DA in the striatum – a subcortical forebrain region important for learning and motivating
goal-directed behaviors. However, we still lack a clear understanding of precisely when, how and over what time
course ACh interacts with DA to differentially affect striatal activity and behavior. We recently discovered that
ACh levels in the striatum of mice constantly undergo large, subsecond fluctuations that are temporally
coordinated with DA and modulated in amplitude depending on behavioral state. The main goal of this proposal
is therefore to build of this observation and to test the hypothesis that DA acts in concert with ACh, such that the
precise timing and amplitude of subsecond ACh transients relative to DA is key for deciphering the effects of DA
on striatal circuits and behavior. We will do so by first monitoring the dynamics of DA and ACh with subsecond
precision from the striatum of mice engaged in reward-based behaviors using dual-color photometry of red and
green DA and ACh sensors (Aim 1). Next, we will mechanistically dissect the functional impact of ACh on DA
release and on striatal activity using photometric imaging combined with genetic and pharmacological
manipulations (Aim 2). Lastly, we will establish that ACh transients can gate the effects of DA on motivation and
learning using calibrated optogenetic manipulations (Aim 3). Together, the proposed work will provide crucial
mechanistic insights into the structure and function of coordinated DA and ACh dynamics in the striatum of mice
and pave the way for future investigations into how the disruption or potentiation of such coordination in humans
contributes to the development or treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders."

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been studied for only one decade but have been implicated in many different
disease settings such as cancer, neurological, and cardiovascular disease. CircRNAs are endogenous RNAs
with a covalently closed loop originating from back-splicing events of pre-mRNA, which can be detected from
raw sequencing data. Moreover, they are seen as powerful biomarkers for major human diseases due to their
stability. However, while there have been advances in computational circRNA analysis, in general, circRNA
research faces computational challenges, specifically the requirement for bioinformatics expertise, the need for
suitable infrastructure, and the location of auspicious datasets. This accessibility gap impedes researchers to
perform critical analyses and contribute to the emerging and exciting field of circRNA research. Existing
methods for circRNA detection from RNA-seq data have been in development for several years, but common
to all of them is the requirement for advanced bioinformatics expertise. Moreover, preprocessing as well as the
actual circRNA detection require considerable bioinformatics infrastructure. Each of these barriers are
significant hurdles for researchers. This proposal is the result of 8 years of circRNA research and algorithm
development. The laboratory of the PI has developed and maintains circRNA software tools that are actively
used by many researchers around the world and has analyzed hundreds of circRNA datasets. The goals of this
proposal are to substantially improve the accessibility and usability of computational circRNA research to all
researchers, independent of computational expertise, infrastructure requirements, or source of data, addressed
in three aims: 1) Develop innovative circtools modules with support for emerging approaches. New modules
will significantly enhance the capabilities of the circtools core application with a specific focus on novel
approaches, such as full-length circRNA sequencing. 2) Create a modular, multi-tool circRNA analysis pipeline
providing functional insights. We will add multiple innovative features to the circtools pipeline that will allow for
increased circRNA detection sensitivity using multiple circRNA detection tools and add functional insights using
external data sources. 3) Design circtools.cloud, a user-friendly web portal to perform comprehensive circRNA
analyses. Building on the expertise of this research team in creating R and Python-based software, the first
dedicated circRNA web application will be created to process raw and processed data. This project will unlock
computational circRNA tools for easy use by researchers who are currently unable to perform circRNA
analyses due to missing infrastructure or computational expertise. Successful completion of this project will
have an immediate and broad impact on circRNA research in human disease studies (as well as other species)
involving circRNAs."

 Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease wherein a loss in immune tolerance leads to the
initiation and progressive destruction of insulin-producing β cells. Numerous immune interventions have been
reported to delay β-cell loss, but a few clinical trials have demonstrated safety and efficacy. Arguably, Fc
receptor–nonbinding anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD3 mAb) have been the most successful clinical
immunotherapy for T1D, showing promising clinical outcomes in patients with new onset T1D as well as high-
risk, nondiabetic relatives of T1D patients. However, a significant number of patients still did not respond
positively to anti-CD3 therapy and the duration of response is limited. Hence, there is a critical need to develop
novel therapeutic interventions to induce immune tolerance for the treatment of T1D. Programmed cell death
protein 1 (PD-1): PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis plays important roles in immune tolerance. NOD mice lacking PD-
L1 or PD-1 develop accelerated T1D and PD-1/PD-L1 expression is low in immune cells of both NOD mice and
T1D patients. Genetically engineering approaches to overexpress PD-L1 or PD-1 in immune cells have shown
to promote immune tolerance in T1D. However, there are still challenges in clinical applications of viral
engineered cells such as toxicity, genotoxicity, low engraftment of gene-edited cells. PD-1/PD-L1 axis also plays
a critical role in anti-CD3-mediated tolerance in T1D. Anti-CD3 therapy induces immune tolerance in overt T1D
in TGFβ-dependent mechanisms, however CD3 antibody-induced remission of T1D in NOD mice is fully
reversed by PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, suggesting that the PD-1/PD-L1 axis may also play a critical role in the
response of T1D patients to anti-CD3 immunotherapy. Thus, combining anti-CD3 mAb with TGFb1/PD-L
treatment may more synergistically restore immune tolerance in T1D; however, this has not yet been tested.
Therefore, the overall goal of the proposed study is to develop a viral engineering- and cell-free strategy to deliver
TGFβ1 and PD-L1 for inducing immune tolerance in T1D using extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced from
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Our central hypothesis that MSC-derived EVs (MSC-EVs) engineered to
deliver TGFb1 and PD-L1 effectively induce immune tolerance in T1D and synergistically enhance anti-CD3-
mediated tolerance in T1D. Aim 1 is to define the mechanisms by which EVs carrying TGFb1 and PD-L1
suppress auto-reactive T cells. Aim 2 is to demonstrate the therapeutic effect of the engineered EVs in
prevention and reversal of T1D onset. Aim 3 is to examine the synergistic effect of the engineered EVs on anti-
CD3-mediated tolerance. The proposed project will provide EV-based therapy to induce immune tolerance and
help improve the efficacy and safety of anti-CD3 therapy in T1D. The significant preclinical data of the
engineered EVs in prevention and reversal of new-onset T1D will facilitate the development of robust and ready-
to-use MSC-EV therapeutics for T1D and other autoimmune diseases."

Recent advances in targeted therapies have prolonged the survival of non-small cell lung cancer patients.
However, lung cancer still remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. and worldwide, and the 5-year
survival rate for non-small cell lung cancer is a dismal 24%. For many tumors, drug-targetable mutations are not
identified, limiting therapeutic options to chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors. For those that do have
identified druggable biomarkers, such as EGFR mutations, acquired resistance is near-universal problem. To
make progress in extending lung cancer patient survival, it is necessary to identify new targets beyond those
that are currently known.
Genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens are increasingly used to identify new cancer drug targets. However,
these assays still suffer from a major limitation, as single-gene knockouts generally do not reveal the functions
of gene families that have redundant functions, such as paralogs. Remarkably, it is now clear that paralogous
genes constitute two-thirds of the human genome, so this blind spot appears to be cover much of the genomic
landscape. To fully interrogate the function of all human genes, we are developing and deploying new methods
for multiplexed gene knockouts. In addition, the same duplications that make paralogs difficult to study could
also provide new, potentially customizable, approaches to cancer therapy, since the deranged genomes typical
of cancer cells commonly harbor deletions and inactivating mutations in one or more paralogs. We hypothesize
that targeting the actively expressed paralog in cancers that have lost or suppressed its paralogous pair could
create a synthetic lethal non-oncogene dependency and a therapeutic window for killing cancer cells.
Here, we propose to overcome the major barriers impeding the development and application of new synthetic
lethal therapies. First, we will build on the success of our paralog work since the first submission by performing
rapid and efficient systematic knockout of synthetic lethal paralogs across multiple cell types. Second, we will
apply our innovative paralog Perturb-seq approach to determine what paralogs undergo transcriptional
adaptation. Last, we will develop reproducible software to perform analysis of dual gRNA CRISPR screens,
enabling the broad adaption of our methods for genetic interaction mapping which may go beyond paralogs.
Ultimately, our findings will deliver new cancer targets that can be used to develop and deploy new therapies.
The impact of this project will be the identification of dozens to hundreds of new paralog genetic interactions
and demonstration that some of these can be harnessed to suppress tumor growth and drug resistance. Due to
the low anticipated off-target effects of synthetic lethal therapies, these could be applied in combination with
existing targeted-, immuno-, or chemo-therapies to suppress drug resistance and improve patient survival."

The Chronic Pancreatitis Diabetes Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC) research consortium is advancing care for
patients with exocrine disease, particularly focused on the overlap of these three conditions through a series of
multicenter collaborative clinically-focused research studies. The University of Minnesota (UMN) offers both
the clinical expertise and the academic environment to contribute substantially and innovatively to the CPDCP.
The UMN provides state of the art clinical care for pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and receives patient
referrals for endoscopic and surgical management of complex acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis (CP)
from across the U.S. Dr. Bellin and Beilman (Co-PIs) will add expertise on chronic pancreatitis-related diabetes
mellitus (CP-DM) and pancreatic surgery to the current consortium membership. Together Bellin and Beilman
have established ongoing collaborations with multiple lead investigators within the CPDCP, highlighting the
ability of this team to integrate seamlessly into the existing CPDCP Clinical Centers. Through engagement as a
sub-site for Ohio State and INSPPIRE within the current consortium structure, UMN has already contributed to
ancillary studies development, manuscripts, and enrollment of participants in the CPDPC developed INSPPIRE
and DETECT protocols. In summary, UMN has documented its ability to contribute to the CPDCP goals and will
add value as a recognized Clinical Center.
As a Clinical Center within the CPDPC, we will enroll adults and children with pancreatitis into the existing
CPDPC studies including PROCEED, INSPPIRE, and DETECT (AIM 1). We will also participate in working
groups, development of protocols and standard operating procedures, and proposal of new ancillary studies. We
propose to build upon the current CPDCP efforts to define mechanisms of CP-DM by studying the
pathophysiology and mechanisms of glucose dysregulation and CP-DM after pancreatic surgery. Pancreatic
surgery including surgical drainage, Whipple procedure, or total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplant
fundamentally alters the pancreatic-intestinal anatomy and may have different endocrine mechanisms by which
hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia develop; since ~20% of patients with CP may have eventually surgery, it is
important to understand disease in this subgroup of patients, in order to properly screen for, treat, and ultimately
prevent CP-DM. For AIM 2 we will enroll patients with CP who have had surgery (n=75 per surgical group) and
an endoscopic CP and healthy control groups to test insulin, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and incretin hormone
secretion and insulin sensitivity by mixed meal tolerance and frequent sample intravenous glucose tolerance
testing to differentiate mechanisms of dysglycemia in these groups. For AIM 3, non-diabetic patients will be re-
studied 12-18 months later to determine risk factors for progressive defects in glycemic regulation. In addition,
we will assess novel exploratory biomarkers (not routinely studied in CP-DM) including markers of beta cell
death, genetic risk factors, and beta cell autoantibodies."
10884900,"Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common non-pulmonary complication of
cystic fibrosis (CF), affecting up to 50% of adults. This diagnosis is linked to more pulmonary
exacerbations, worsening lung function, and increased mortality compared to those without
CFRD. Individuals with CFRD have more Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and Staphylococcus
Aureus pulmonary infections determined by culture based microbial analysis. However, the
specific microbiome seen in CFRD and how the microbiome changes with glycemic
manipulation is not understood. The development of CFRD may also be influenced by genetic
traits for insulin resistance and beta cell function, though studies evaluating this are limited.
Insulin is the only recommended treatment that has been shown to improve pulmonary
outcomes in CFRD; however, good glycemic control is difficult to achieve in this patient
population due to high carbohydrate intake, frequent hypoglycemia, and the added burden of
diabetes tasks. Artificial pancreas (AP) technology is a promising approach to controlling blood
glucose with greater accuracy and ease than conventional methods. We have funding to study
an AP device, the bionic pancreas (BP), in a randomized parallel design clinical trial in subjects
with poorly controlled CFRD (R01DK119699-01, PI:Putman). These subjects will be randomized
to usual care (UC) or the BP for 6 months, evaluating the impact of the BP not only on glycemic
control but also on CF-specific outcomes including nutritional status and pulmonary function.
We will leverage this funded trial to investigate novel clinical and genetic predictors of CFRD
and will use state-of-the-art microbiome analytic techniques to understand how glycemic control
impacts microbiome diversity in CF. Aim 1 will compare the microbiome in CFRD subjects
participating in this trial to biorepository samples from non-CFRD subjects and determine how
baseline glycemia influences the microbiome. Aim 2 will investigate genetic and clinical
predictors of baseline glycemia and response to the BP intervention in subjects with CFRD. Aim
3 will evaluate how strict glycemic control achieved with the BP impacts microbiome diversity
over 6 months, and if the change in lung function seen with improved glycemia is mediated
through the change in microbiome.
In summary, the research and mentoring plan proposed in this K23 application will test
innovative hypotheses about glycemic traits and the microbiome in patients with CFRD, will
broaden our understanding of CFRD, and will provide the necessary training and investigational
niche for Dr. Brenner to develop a successful, independent career in clinical research."
10876616,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S., and numerous studies
have linked CVD to short- and long-term exposures to particulate air pollution (PM), however, the PM properties
responsible for its toxicity are still not fully understood. Recently, we reported associations between PM gross β-
activity and CVD mortality, blood pressure, oxidative stress, and lung and cardiac function. The primary source
of ambient PM radioactivity (PR) in the U.S. is Rn gas, specifically its decay products (radionuclides) which can
attach to ambient PM, and after inhalation, release ionizing radiation (α-, β-, and γ-radiation) inside the human
body (internal dose). Although many studies have reported the effects of Rn decay products on cancer risk, we
know very little about the non-cancer health effects of PR. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the effects
of short- and long-term PR exposures on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity on a national scale and in a
systematic way using a spectrum of PR exposure metrics, and determine whether PR exposure intensifies PM
toxicity. To do this we have put together a large collection of PR measures. Using data from the U.S. EPA
Radiation Network (RadNet), in Aim 1 we will assess the acute effects of short-term PR exposure, as measured
by PM β-activity in 163 cities for the years 1987-2018, and PM γ-activities (35 cities for 2006-2018) on individual
CVD admissions among Medicare enrollees and all ages CVD mortality. In Aim 2 we will examine the chronic
effects of long-term PM β- and γ-activities on CVD admissions. In Aim 3, in the four U.S. cities with U.S. Nuclear
Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty sites in 2000-2018, we will estimate the acute and chronic effects of exposure
to individual radionuclides on CVD admissions and mortality. In three U.S. cities (Aim 4) we will measure daily
exposures to PM α-activity associated with short-lived radionuclides using a newly developed continuous
monitor, and in one city we will estimate daily exposures to PM α-activity from long-lived radionuclides using
archived and newly collected filters. Using these data we will then assess the acute effects of short-term
exposures to PM2.5 gross α-activity associated with long-lived radionuclides and short-lived radionuclides on
CVD admissions and mortality. In all aims, we will examine seasonal and regional variability, confounding by
PM2.5, exposure-response, timing of exposure, effect modification by individual and area level risk factors and
apply both traditional and causal inference methods to address confounding. This will be the first study to provide
rigorous scientific evidence of the cardiovascular effects of radioactive particles in a national population-based
study, and to describe the CVD effects of PM α-activity. Investigations based on both Medicare and mortality
data will make conclusions generalizable to the entire U.S. population. Because exposures to PR are ubiquitous,
our findings may have important implications for environmental and public health policies. Improving our
understanding of the factors influencing PM toxicity is critical to developing cost-effective air quality standards to
protect public health."
10876721,"The goal of this study—Applied Implementation Research for Clean Cooking in Cambodia (AIR-C3)—is to
design and demonstrate the effectiveness of a scalable strategy for achieving equitable access to and
sustained and exclusive use of induction-based clean cooking in low- and middle-income settings. An
estimated 3 billion people use biomass fuels (e.g., wood, charcoal, animal dung, and coal) for cooking in polluting
open fires or inefficient stoves. The resulting household air pollution (HAP), including fine particulate matter, is a
leading environmental risk factor for ill-health worldwide and an important contributor to climate change. There
is recent, compelling evidence that switching to near-exclusive use of cleaner fuels such as liquified petroleum
gas dramatically reduces HAP exposures. However, successful, at-scale implementation of clean cooking
interventions has been limited, and few studies have evaluated the impacts of electric induction cooking,
arguably the cleanest household cooking solution. We will address these gaps by conducting the first large-scale
implementation and effectiveness evaluation of induction-based clean cooking interventions among low-income
households in peri-urban Cambodia. We will use implementation science methods and apply tested
frameworks to establish a rigorous, transferable, and reproducible evidence base. We will conduct
formative research to assess barriers to and enablers of purchase and use of induction stoves, and refine and
rapidly prototype implementation strategies for our context (SA1). We will employ a four-arm, hybrid type II cluster
randomized trial to test intervention strategies to transition households away from biomass fuels towards
exclusive clean cooking. Trial arms will include direct sales, public sector promotion, and fuel and stove subsidies
(SA2). Among a subset of our participants, we will measure the primary cook’s exposure to HAP before and after
introducing induction stoves, providing evidence on the exposure-reducing potential of our intervention
strategies. We will provide paradigm-shifting evidence of (a) the viability of electric cooking in areas that can
support it, accelerating the transition towards clean household energy for billions, and (b) the cost, benefits, and
effectiveness (SA2 and SA3) of these strategies to encourage uptake and sustained use of clean cooking. By
providing evidence of successful implementation strategies and their effects on exposure to household
air pollution, this study will serve as a model and motivation for adoption and scale-up of similar
programs across South and Southeast Asia and beyond."
10877286,"ABSTRACT: Early-life iron deficiency (ID) is prevalent throughout the world, affecting 40-50% of pregnant
women, fetuses, and children. ID impairs cognition in children, causes persistent cognitive impairments and
increases risk of neuropsychiatric disorders despite postnatal iron treatment. The long-term effects of early-life
ID are the real cost to society because of lost education and job potential and their association with
transgenerational racial health disparities. In mice, hippocampal neuron-specific ID causes long-term
learning/memory neurocircuit dysfunction despite postnatal iron repletion, demonstrating the long-term effects
are due to neuronal iron loss during development. Thus, dysregulation of early-life neuronal iron-requiring
activities set neuronal functional capacity across the lifespan.
 The fetal/neonatal brain is highly metabolic, accounting for 60% of total body oxygen consumption. The
hippocampus has one of the highest regional metabolic rates in the neonatal brain. Iron provides the catalytic
component for enzymes required for mitochondrial electron transport and energy production. Mitochondrial
quality control mechanisms (e.g., redox balance, fusion/fission, and mitophagy) maintain mitochondrial structure
and energetic homeostasis and prevent long-term mitochondrial damage and dysfunction. Early-life ID acutely
disrupts these processes, impairing dendrite and synapse formation. Postnatal iron repletion does not rescue
ID-induced mitochondrial energetic impairments in the adult brain, suggesting a permanent reprogramming.
 The cellular mechanisms of how developmental ID causes long-term neuronal structural and functional
deficits and whether these can be prevented with iron treatment alone are unclear. We will test the overall
hypothesis that permanently impaired hippocampal mitochondrial energetic capacity and quality control is
programmed during early life, directly contributes to the compromised neurocircuitry that persists after recovery
from early-life ID and that prenatal maternal iron repletion is required to prevent this. In Aim 1, we will utilize a
unique in vitro model of chronic fetal-neonatal hippocampal neuronal ID to test the timing and dose of
iron repletion during development in order to prevent programming of long-term mitochondrial neuronal
structural deficits. We will treat iron-deficient hippocampal neuron cultures with moderate or high dose iron at
neuron developmental stages equivalent to human 2nd trimester, birth, and 6-12 months. Recovery of
mitochondrial quality control mechanisms and synapse formation will be assessed as outcome measures. Aim
2 uses an in vivo rat model of dietary fetal-neonatal ID to test whether fetal iron treatment is necessary
and sufficient to prevent permanent abnormalities in hippocampal mitochondrial structure/function,
epigenetics, neuron structure and neurocognitive behavior in adulthood. This proposal is highly significant
because it will provide neurobiologically-based mechanistic evidence to delineate accurate timing and dosing of
iron repletion and inform adjunct therapy strategies to reduce the lifelong consequences of fetal-neonatal ID."

 The MT IDeA Community Engagement Core (CEC) has been critical to the program’s research
success for the last 20 years. The CEC is a shared core between MT INBRE and the Center for
American Indian and Rural Health Equity (CAIRHE), a phase 2 COBRE program at Montana State
University. The core collaborates with three networks: the MT INBRE statewide network (16 partner
institutions), the CAIRHE Health Equity Network (local, statewide, and regional health agencies,
foundations, and institutes), and RAIN (Regional Alliance of INBRE Networks), which includes all
seven states in the Western Region (AK, ID, HI, MT, NM, NV, WY). Working among these networks
enhances the collective impact of the CEC by facilitating broad public access to research findings:
sharing of data and new models for ensuring a healthy MT population, providing additional
opportunities for shared grant funding, and enhancing collaborative community-based participatory
research (CBPR), such as the impacts of climate change on health in our state. Overall, the CEC
elevates solutions to health disparities and helps to improve the health of all populations in Montana.
 To maximize its impact, the CEC will accomplish 3 Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Train
investigators and students involved in community-based participatory research (CBPR). In addition to
the CEC’s existing portfolio of formalized training tools spanning introductory to
advanced topics, the core is working with the Institute of Translational Health Sciences (ITHS), a
CTSA at the University of Washington (UW), to leverage expertise on both sides to build a solid
educational platform for investigators. Specific Aim 2: Expand the Health Equity Network and
partnerships in Montana and regionally. These partnerships are an excellent complement to the
academic institutional network developed by MT INBRE and have enhanced and expanded research
and its collective impact through community partnerships. Specific Aim 3: Develop strategies for
increased and improved dissemination and implementation of research and development of
interventions. Analysis of CBPR studies during INBRE IV revealed that in many cases information
and findings were not widely disseminated. We recognize that uncommunicated knowledge and
limited availability of research findings impede the value of many CBPR studies. The core will offer
academic-community partnership training for disseminating research statewide and regionally, with
the vision that research outcomes and interventions can be replicated in other communities facing
similar health equity challenges."

sex steroid signaling is required for normal body weight maintenance. We previously showed that estrogen
receptor α (ERα) neurons in the medial amygdala (MeA) stimulate physical activity and energy expenditure to
decrease body weight in both males and females. It suggests that the estrogen/ERαMeA circuit constitutes part
of a previously undefined brain metabolic signaling in both males and females. Interestingly, the MeA has high
levels of other three key components of testosterone/estrogen signaling, including an essential enzyme for
estrogen synthesis (aromatase; Aro), and key mediating receptors for testosterone/estrogen signaling (androgen

metabolic functions. We hypothesize that the neurosteroid testosterone/estrogen signaling pathways in the MeA
interact to maintain normal energy homeostasis. To test this, three mutant mice will be generated to have each
of these three components deleted specifically in the MeA neurons, respectively. These mouse strains (both
males and females) will be used to determine the physiological roles of these three components in maintaining
energy homeostasis in different sexes. The functional interactions between these components and the sex

10876330,"Summary: Prior alloimmunization places patients at risk for anamnestic alloantibody formation following
alloantigen re-exposure that can result in accelerated RBC clearance and lead to a potentially fatal delayed

of understanding regarding key immune pathways that govern anamnestic RBC alloantibody responses capable
of driving DHTRs. Our long-term goal is to identify and then target critical pathways that regulate the development
of anamnestic alloantibody formation. Our central hypothesis is that anamnestic RBC alloantibody formation
occurs through a distinct toll-like receptor (TLR), bridging channel dendritic cell (DC) and follicular (FO) B cell-
dependent pathway that fundamentally differs from primary RBC alloimmunization. Our hypothesis is formulated
on the basis of our discovery that unlike initial RBC alloimmunization, which requires marginal zone (MZ) B cells,
MZ B cells are not required for anamnestic alloantibody formation, but are required for early priming events that
occur following initial RBC alloantigen exposure. In addition to differences in MZ B cell requirements, while initial
alloantibody formation is CD4 T cell independent (TI), increased alloantibody levels observed following RBC re-
exposure is entirely CD4 T cell dependent (TD). Furthermore, while T follicular helper cell (TFH) and follicular
(FO) B cells are not required for initial alloantibody formation, initial RBC transfusion does increase TFH and FO
B cell numbers. Re-transfusion also increases 33D1+ DC activation and chemokine receptor expression. These
results suggest that initial RBC transfusion primes recipients by generating distinct alloantigen-specific TFH and
FO B cell populations that can, in turn, be activated by 33D1+ DCs following RBC alloantigen re-exposure
independent of MZ B cells. In addition, while type I interferons (IFNab) are required for primary alloantibody
formation, TLR signaling is dispensable for initial alloantibody development, yet is required for anamnestic
alloantibody formation. Given the ability of MZ B cells to directly activate CD4 T cells and traffic antigen to the
B cell follicle, our data suggest that initial priming events require MZ B cell-mediated CD4 T cell and FO B cell
development through an IFNab-dependent process. However, as anamnestic alloantibody formation occurs
through a MZ B cell-independent pathway and DCs can also traffic antigen to B cells and directly activate CD4
T cells, DCs likely orchestrate anamnestic alloantibody formation through a TLR-dependent pathway. To test
this hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Define the role of MZ B cells and
IFNab in the development of CD4 T cells and FO B cells required for a subsequent anamnestic
alloantibody response. Specific Aim 2: Define the role of TLRs and DCs in the development of an
anamnestic alloantibody response following RBC alloantigen re-exposure. Successful completion of these
aims will define key factors that regulate anamnestic alloantibody responses and in so doing provide an important
framework to prevent alloimmunization that leads to DHTRs."

New, inexpensive, accessible treatments are urgently needed to regulate chronic inflammation in sickle cell dis-
ease (SCD). SCD is a devastating red blood cell disorder that impacts millions of people worldwide. The majority
of clinical symptoms in SCD, including stroke, vaso-occclusive crisis (VOC), and acute chest syndrome (ACS)
are largely attributable to uncontrolled inflammation driven by excessive hemolysis, due to the release of heme
that triggers the innate immune response. As the precise mechanisms are unclear, closing this knowledge gap
is essential for identifying new druggable targets to mitigate symptoms of chronic inflammation in SCD. Building
on prior research from the applicant showing that the inflammatory caspases, caspase-1, -4, and -5 are essential
mediators of heme-induced inflammation, and that caspase-4 is the apical caspase in this pathway, the central
hypothesis of this application is that heme-induced caspase-4 activation is the apical step in the inflamma-
tory caspase cascade inducing chronic inflammation that leads to organ injury in SCD. This hypothesis
will be tested by determining: 1) the mechanisms of heme-induced caspase-4 activation; 2) the consequences
of heme-induced caspase-4 activation in SCD; and 3) the contributions of inflammatory caspases to clinical
outcomes in children with SCD. Under the first Aim, heme binding sites on caspase-4 will be identified to test the
working hypothesis that heme binding to caspase-4 is an initiating activation event of systemic inflammation in
SCD. Under the second Aim, a caspase-4 knockout SCD mouse will be used to investigate the role of caspase-
4 in heme-induced inflammation, vaso-occlusion, and lethality in SCD. Under the third Aim, patient data and
samples will be assessed for markers of hemolysis (free heme/heme scavenger levels) and inflammatory
caspase pathways (plasma cytokine levels, macrophage markers, inflammasome gene expression) to determine
how they relate to clinical outcomes (VOC, ACS, abnormal TCD, and stroke). By analyzing coding variants of
caspases and direct inhibition of caspase-4 in patient cells, the consequences of disrupting these pathways in
individual patients will be evaluated. Upon completion of these aims, the mechanisms, and consequences of
heme-induced inflammatory caspase activation at the cellular, organ, and patient level will be uncovered. These
investigations will provide essential information for developing efficient, specific, and accessible drugs to coun-
teract the often-fatal consequences of inflammation in SCD."

The Cardiovascular Research Training Program at Brigham and Women's Hospital aims to
prepare trainees for independent careers in investigative pursuits. The three themes of
particular focus for this T-32 program include 1) Myocardial Cellular and Molecular Biology and
Genetics, 2) Vascular Cell and Molecular Biology, and 3) Translational/Clinical Cardiovascular
Research. We propose to strive to continue our record of preparing our trainees to develop
independent research programs, obtain faculty positions, and acquire peer-reviewed funding.
Our environment offers substantial resources to trainees, ranging from core laboratories within
Brigham and Women's Hospital, formal educational opportunities including those of the adjacent
Chan-Harvard School of Public Health, and ample resources within the individual laboratories of
faculty members. The program provides a structured program for each trainee including
formulating formal Individual Development Plans for each trainee, orientation lectures, formal
instruction in responsible conduct and professionalism in research, advanced course work,
multiple inter-disciplinary research group meetings and seminar series, and tailored and flexible
research experiences. Indeed, a historical strength of our T-32 program is working with trainees
to place them in the best laboratory and mentoring environment to meet their individual training
needs and career goals whether it be at BWH and its partner institution the MGH, or in the
broader surrounding environment including the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Harvard
Medical School and Chan School of Public Health, The Broad Institute, Children’s Hospital, MIT,
the Harvard BioLabs and the Stem Cell Regenerative Biology Institute among others. Each
trainee works under the close supervision of a faculty mentor throughout their training. In
addition, a Fellowship Advisory Board oversees the program and monitors closely the progress
of trainees and their Individual Development Plans. The Research-in-Progress seminar, an
annual Fellow's Poster Session, and Cardiovascular Grand Rounds serve to highlight and
support the work of the post-doctoral trainees. We have a particular and successful commitment
to recruiting and fostering the careers of woman and minority trainees. In this renewal
application we propose to continue our longstanding record (documented within) of preparing a
talented pool of fellows for successful academic careers."

The Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is a DNA tumor virus that causes an elevated incidence of lymphoma in the
HIV/AIDS population. While more than 90% of the world's population carries EBV, the virus typically exists in a
“latent” state with little impact on the host. In response to certain stimuli or local microenvironmental cues,
however, EBV enters the lytic viral replication program, leading to viral spread both between and within hosts.
In addition to the known role of viral latency proteins in EBV associated cancers, there are well-established
links between lytic replication and EBV associated cancers; and elevated EBV lytic replication in HIV co-
infection (+ or – ART) likely contributes to the increased susceptibility of HIV infected individuals to EBV
associated lymphomas.
With minimal genetic content, viruses are inexorably dependent on host cell resources for their replication and
they evolve mechanisms to modulate host cell metabolic processes to facilitate efficient virus production. One
of the most conserved virus-host interactions in herpesvirus replication is “host shut off” where virus encoded
factors degrade host cell mRNAs, freeing up translation resources for dedicated production of viral structural
proteins. Recently, the Glaunsinger lab showed that the murine γ-herpesvirus, MHV68 also inhibits Pol II
loading on cell genes. This illustrates the utilization of layered host shut off mechanisms that together
overcome the rate-limiting step of viral structural protein production.
Using EBV reactivation models that facilitate assessment of transcriptome changes in pure reactivating cell
populations, we gained new and unexpected insights into EBV's interactions with the host cell transcriptome.
Among a number of observed transcriptome alterations is our finding that EBV causes transcription initiation at
more than 25,000 cell genomic sites that have no previous evidence of promoter activity. These “de novo”
promoters are unusually simple, being composed of only one or two short viral transcription factor binding
motif(s) that due to their short nature, occur randomly at a high frequency across the cell genome. Our
preliminary data suggests that one of these motifs is recognized by the viral preinitiation complex, vPIC, which
binds a “TATA”-like motif (TATT(TA)AA) and has been shown in some cases to activate viral late genes
without apparent support from other transcription factors. We hypothesize that EBV utilizes the ability of vPIC
to single-handedly activate transcription through these simple motifs to spawn thousands of host de novo
promoters and substantially alter the cell transcriptome and chromatin architecture.
Our preliminary studies also show that the most highly active de novo promoters have enriched localization
within 1.5 kb of canonical cell promoters, with transcriptional orientations toward the respective canonical
promoters. We hypothesize that while EBV utilizes the primal nature of late viral promoter motifs to target
thousands of sites throughout the cell genome, it leverages chromatin context near canonical promoters to
drive high-level de novo promoter transcription, leading to targeted transcriptional interference (TI) of host
promoters. This represents a new mechanistic concept for virus-host interactions that contributes to disrupted
cell gene expression and dedicated production of viral structural proteins.
In this proposal, we will 1) investigate the underlying mechanisms of de novo promoter specification and local
chromatin context driving high level transcription near existing canonical promoters, and 2) investigate the
impact of de novo transcription and transcriptional interference in downregulating cell mRNA expression."

Reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPAs) offer a powerful functional proteomic approach to investigate molecular
mechanisms and response to therapy in cancer. MD Anderson Cancer Center is a leader in the implementation
of this antibody-based technology that can assess many protein markers across large numbers of samples in a
cost-effective, sensitive, and high-throughput manner. The platform currently assesses ~500 protein markers,
covering all major signaling pathways and most drug targets. Its utility was demonstrated through its selection
as the platform for proteomic characterization of ~8,000 patient samples through TCGA and >1,000 cell lines
through CCLE, and its designation as one of two NCI Genome Characterization Centers in 2015. It is an
approved Cancer Therapy Evaluation Platform site for sample characterization, leading to the implementation of
multiple effective clinical trials. With ITCR support, we have developed a major bioinformatics resource dedicated
to the analysis, visualization, and dissemination of RPPA data, The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), which has
a community of >80,000 users worldwide. The current objective is to improve the data quality control, to enhance
the existing analytic capabilities, and to expand the scope of TCPA by adding new functionalities and datasets.
We have formed working relationships to link TCPA with other widely used bioinformatics resources. As an
experienced, multidisciplinary team, we will pursue four specific aims: Aim #1. Develop a user-friendly, all-in-one
software pipeline for processing RPPA data. We will improve quality control and batch effects adjustment steps
of RPPA data processing, enhance the performance of the pipeline and interactivity of the results, and provide
a user-friendly, general software package to the scientific community. Aim #2. Expand and enhance our existing
web platforms for the analysis of RPPA data. We will extend the scope of RPPA data, incorporate other types of
molecular data, especially proteomic data, and enhance the analytic and visualization capabilities. Aim #3. Build
a user-friendly, interactive web platform for the analysis of cancer RPPA data from xenograft, PDX, and animal
models. We will collect and compile RPPA data of >10,000 such samples and develop related visualization and
analytic modules. Aim #4. Promote TCPA and active interaction with the user community. We will enhance the
RPPA data repository and promote it as a standard reference database, provide documentation, hands-on
workshops, and bug fixes, and build web APIs for interaction with other tools. The expected outcome is a
dedicated, comprehensive bioinformatics resource that fully integrates RPPA data generation, analysis,
dissemination, and user feedback, allowing for fluent exploration and analysis of high-quality proteomic data in
rich contexts. The project is important because it will greatly enhance the quality and reproducibility of RPPA
data from important consortium projects; substantially reduce barriers in mining complex functional proteomic
data; serve as a hub for integrating high-quality RPPA-based proteomics data into other widely used
bioinformatic resources, and directly facilitate the development of protein markers for precision cancer medicine."

Program. We have 145 faculty members across our multidisciplinary and multi-institutional consortium working
together with 24 low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) institutions in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and
the Latin America and the Caribbean. A strategic planning process; including a comprehensive review of our
consortium's role in combatting the global HIV epidemic, emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, non-
communicable diseases, and mental health; was conducted to inform this proposal. A vision statement
encompassing five Themes – Global Impact, Multidisciplinary Science, Integrated Training with Equal
Partnership, Diverse Generation of Global Health Researchers, and Highly Committed Environment–
shapes our work. Key innovations strengthening this proposal include ensuring diversity at the leadership level
and across all research areas; leveraging our institutional commitments in global research training;
amalgamating our strong foundations in clinical, behavioral and laboratory science; enacting a participatory
monitoring and evaluation program; and launching emerging leaders. Aim 1 – Create collaborative,
interdisciplinary global health research that integrates cross-institutional pairing of mentors. The
research training “triad” of US mentor, LMIC mentor, and scholar form a long-term training partnership that
builds research capacity of the scholars and the LMIC partner institutions. Outcomes: Robust interdisciplinary
collaboration engendering innovative research driven by integration and equal partnership between our four
universities and LMIC partners. Aim 2 – Provide one-year research training for 105 scholars with linkage
to the Mentorship Triad Paradigm. We will provide training for five yearly cohorts of 15 scholars (9 US post-
docs, 2 US pre-docs, and 4 LMIC post-docs) in global health research, including coursework and a mentored
research practicum. We will leverage institutional commitment of $1.5 million to support an additional 30
scholars over five years to maximize impact. Outcomes: 90% of scholars completing training will submit grant
proposals and/or publish their research. Aim 3 – Promote and support diversity, equity and inclusion in
global health research training. We will leverage our existing initiatives and affiliations with Minority Serving
Institutions and pipeline programs. This will include broad outreach to departments, centers, and schools at
partner universities; and engaging student groups and associations of underrepresented populations in global
health. Outcomes: 50% of LMIC scholars will be women and at least 30% of US scholars will be from
underrepresented minorities. Aim 4 – Support the transition of scholars into successful and sustainable
research careers. We will link scholar selection to LMIC priorities and research programs. Outcomes:
Sustained collaboration between scholars and INSIGHT consortium researchers for at least five years."

Cardiomyocytes sense macro scale mechanical cues to adapt their structure and function, and disturbances of
these mechanical signals can cause a negative feedback loop that leads to changes in cardiomyocyte structure
and ultimately decreased cardiac output. Important to this mechanical sensing are focal adhesions, the
mechanosensitive protein complexes that attach the cell cytoskeleton to the underlying extracellular matrix
(ECM). Although focal adhesions have been shown to be necessary for myofilament maturation and are sensitive
to external substrate characteristics, little is known about the specific forces sensed at these complexes during
the physiological contraction cycle or how this adhesive tension is regulated by cardiomyocyte contractility.
Furthermore, alterations of cardiomyocyte contractile tension initiate maladaptive cell remodeling, but this
mechanism and the involvement of focal adhesions are poorly understood. Given that focal adhesions of other
cell types have been shown to distribute focal adhesion tension unevenly within individual cells and
microdomains and that there are regional heterogeneities in cardiomyocyte strain, it is important to understand
the spatial distribution of mechanosensing in cardiomyocytes as the myofibrils contract against the ECM. This
proposal aims to fill the crucial gap in knowledge of the role of focal adhesions and their interactions with both
the myofibril structures and the ECM for the mechanical homeostasis of contracting cardiomyocytes. Previous
studies of focal adhesion sensation during contraction have been limited by the inability to measure exact force
across the focal adhesions in a time and spatially resolved manner. A recently developed tool that has been
used to study mechanically driven cell processes is the FRET (Förster Resonant Energy Transfer) tension
sensor, which I have engineered to express endogenously in induced pluripotent stem cells within the focal
adhesion gene vinculin. Preliminary data from stem cell derived cardiomyocytes that express this sensor show
myofibril contraction confers an increase in global focal adhesion tension sensation in static cells. However, the
spatial and temporal generation of force in cardiomyocytes during contraction is not yet known and will be
examined in this project using cutting edge microscopy and image analysis techniques. Importantly, this model
overcomes previous limitations of overexpression artifacts or inconsistent sensor expression. Thus, I propose to
first quantify spatial and temporal physiological focal adhesion tension during static and dynamic cardiomyocyte
contraction. Second, I will modulate both the inherent contractility of cardiomyocytes and their connection to the
ECM to determine the internal and external regulation of focal adhesion tension in cardiomyocytes. These aims
will provide a complete understanding of focal adhesion tension generation during CM contraction. This
understanding may inform future studies to develop better targeted therapies to maintain mechanical
homeostasis in heart disease."

There is increasing evidence that early intervention for psychosis in coordinated specialty care
(CSC) services improves outcomes and lives. The outcome of early course psychosis (EP) is
heterogeneous, ranging from early full recovery to treatment resistance and functional decline
from the onset of illness. This heterogeneity limits our ability to predict individual level outcomes
needed for treatment planning and for tailoring the type, duration and intensity of therapeutic
interventions. Biomarkers as well as clinical and demographic features, early in the illness can
predict outcome, but taken individually, their prognostic value is limited. Our Bipolar-
Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (BSNIP) consortium has recently developed,
replicated and validated a biomarker (EEG, eye movement testing, and neurocognition) based
categorization (Biotypes 1, 2 and 3) in a trans-diagnostic sample of cases with idiopathic
psychosis (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder with psychosis), ranging
from 18-35 years of age. In this study, we will leverage this categorization, along with clinical and
biomarker data to predict illness trajectory and outcome during follow-up at 1, 6 and 12 months in
320 EP patients across CSC clinics at the five B-SNIP sites. First, we will characterize outcome
trajectories and Biotype structure in EP. Our available data indicate the Biotype structure will be
the same in EP as in our large sample. Second, we will investigate the predictive value of the nine
bio-factors and the three Biotypes identified by B-SNIP for symptomatic and functional outcome.
We predict that the EP population will manifest distinct outcome clinical trajectories (good,
intermediate and poor) and will have a Biotype structure similar to that seen in chronic psychosis
subjects, i.e., Biotypes 1, 2 and 3) (hypothesis 1). Biotype-3, and Biotye-2 cases, will have the
best outcomes (defined both categorically, and dimensionally, using symptomatic, cognitive and
functional measures); Biotype-1 will have the worst outcomes to CSC treatment, across all target
time points (hypothesis 2). Notably, Biotype-1 and Biotype-2 cases will have the same level of
cognition function at baseline. Finally, we will investigate the predictive value of clinical (such as
diagnosis, illness duration, substance abuse, and treatment adherence), and biomarker (including
neuroimaging) features in a multi-variate model and will develop a feasible biomarker battery and
predictive algorithm for application in community CSC sites nation-wide. We will thus provide to
the field a means for predicting success of EP cases in CSC treatment to improve clinical practice
and to enhance efficient use of available treatment resources."

Social interaction deficits are at the crux of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and contribute to significant
functional impairment, including poorer relationship quality and low employment rates in individuals with ASD.
Despite an enormous amount of research dollars invested and thousands of research papers published on the
topic, we remain far from understanding the basic neural computations underlying social processes in ASD. In
the current proposal, we posit that this information gap is due in part to the rarity with which computational model-
based analyses are used in ASD neuroimaging research. Additionally, most studies use passive paradigms (e.g.
face perception) rather than examining brain functioning while participants engage in ecologically-relevant,
interactive social tasks more akin to the type of interactions with which people with ASD struggle in their daily
lives. This proposal takes an innovative computational psychiatry approach to understanding aberrant neural
computations of social interactions in ASD, using high-resolution (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) and virtual reality-like tasks that test individuals’ abilities to proactively and dynamically engage in
simulated social interactions. In particular, we focus on the ability of individuals with ASD to: 1) discriminate and
track levels of closeness and power when navigating social interactions in a choose-your-own-adventure style
interactive paradigm, and 2) understand and adapt to social norms and exert control over social others in the
context of a proactive social exchange paradigm. We use novel computational models to examine the neural
computations and connectivity underlying proactive social behavior, focusing on brain regions (e.g.,
hippocampus) that have been understudied in the context of social deficits in ASD. Finally, we use machine
learning approaches to explore ASD heterogeneity along dimensions of dynamic and proactive social
interactions and apply these indices to make clinically-meaningful predictions. We hypothesize that: 1)
hippocampal tracking of social space will be less robust in ASD as compared to neurotypical controls and will
correlate with social symptoms; 2) ASD individuals will show slower norm adaptation rate, greater aversion to
norm violation, and reduced social controllability, accompanied by reduced neural encoding of social values in
anterior insula and ventral striatum; and 3) these parameters will help identify subtypes of ASD and predict ASD-
relevant outcomes (e.g. social skills, adaptive social functioning, quality of life). We expect that findings from this
project will break new ground and fill critical knowledge gaps regarding the neurobiology of ASD. In particular,
we expect our findings will greatly enhance understanding of the neural and computational mechanisms
underlying deficits in proactive social behavior in ASD and will allow us to identify distinct, neurobiologically-
driven clusters. In so doing, the results of this project could offer new tools by which to subtype the ASD
phenotype and provide novel insights into treatment targets."
10880385,"ABSTRACT
Obsessive-compulsive disorder affects 1-4% of children and produces substantial morbidity and disruption of
normal development. In some children, rapid onset and a characteristic set of accompanying symptoms
suggest a unique pathophysiology; this has been termed ‘Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome’,
or PANS. PANS onset often occurs following an infectious illness, suggesting that some cases of rapid-onset
pediatric OCD are triggered by neuroinflammatory processes. Specifically, it has been proposed that certain
infections can, in a susceptible child, lead to the production of autoantibodies that cross-react with brain
epitopes and lead to basal ganglia inflammation, and thereby to OCD symptomatology. The targets of these
autoantibodies remain unclear, and the hypothesis of autoimmunity as a cause of PANS is controversial.
In recent work we used a novel approach to characterize the binding of antibodies from children with PANDAS
(Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcus), a form of PANS in which
symptoms are temporally associated with Streptococcal infection, to brain tissue. We have discovered, and
multiply replicated, that IgG from children with PANDAS binds to specific interneurons within the caudate-
putamen: the cholinergic interneurons, or CINs. CIN binding by PANDAS-associated IgG reduces their activity
in two ex vivo assays. Both effects – IgG binding to CINs and reduction in their activity – are lost in children
who exhibit symptomatic improvement following immune-modulating therapy. CIN pathology has been
independently associated with Tourette syndrome, and we have found CIN disruption to lead to repetitive
behavioral pathology in mice. These convergent findings give inherent plausibility to the novel hypothesis that
antibody binding to and consequent inhibition of CINs contributes to the pathophysiology of PANDAS.
Here we test and extend this analysis in critical ways. First, we will use the novel REAP screening
methodology, based on yeast surface display of >3000 human proteins in their native conformation, to identify
candidate antibody targets. We will validate these candidates by testing whether antibodies against them can
bind to and inhibit CINs; pilot work has already identified three such candidates, and new data confirm CIN
binding by one of them. Second, by examining sera from >350 children drawn from specialty treatment centers
across the country, we will test whether CIN binding is specific to PANDAS or is seen more generally in PANS,
or even in non-PANS OCD. Finally, we will culture individual B cells from selected children with PANDAS and
PANS and will screen them for production of monoclonal antibodies against identified targets. This will, for the
first time, allow us to identify and clone specific candidate autoantibodies associated with these conditions.
Together, these innovative studies have the potential to fundamentally advance our understanding of PANS
and PANDAS, paving the way for a pathophysiology-based nosology and for the development of new
diagnostic tools and treatments."
10879459,"Endothelial cells interface blood and tissues for nutrient and fluid transport between organs.
Therefore, endothelial cells critically provide fatty acids and other carbon fuels to meet tissue
demands during periods of nutrient limitation. Despite vital interorgan communication roles for
endothelial cells, we lack fundamental insight into how endothelial cells serve systemic
metabolism and the responses to food and environmental challenges.
Metabolic disorders such as obesity and insulin resistance reflect the combined impacts of genetic
and environmental factors that alter the ways the liver and adipose tissues govern energy balance.
Therefore, precise strategies must activate or repress metabolic pathways in the liver and adipose
tissues to maintain the energetic needs of connected organ systems. In the previous funding cycle,
we established that circulating bone morphogenetic protein-binding endothelial regulator (BMPER)
promoted hepatic insulin sensitivity in multiple mouse models of diabetes. In addition, human
BMPER gene variants and its protein plasma level were strongly associated with obese
parameters. The subsequent experiments demonstrated BMPER abundance in blood coincides
with nutrient availability. Fasting in rodents and people increased BMPER levels in blood while
feeding caused a coincident reduction in bioavailable BMPER. Mechanistically, our preliminary
data suggest fasting causes BMPER release from the liver, which acts on adipose tissue to
liberate free fatty acids and glycerol for gluconeogenesis. Peroxisome proliferator activated
receptor alpha activation heightens BMPER expression in the liver upon fasting. However, this
signaling axis is likely dysregulated by high fat-diet feeding. Based on our preliminary data, we
hypothesize that fasting-induced BMPER in the liver acts as an endocrine stimulator of lipolysis
in adipose tissue. We will test our hypothesis by defining how BMPER influences fatty acid
mobilization in adipose tissue; establishing mechanisms governing BMPER regulation of
adipocyte lipolysis; and determining nutrient sensing transcription factors that regulate BMPER
availability in serum. Our studies will define a new liver-to-adipose tissue circuit mediated by
BMPER in the regulation of energy homeostasis and offer new insight into whether BMPER
signaling can be leveraged for the treatment of obesity, diabetes and other metabolic disorders."
10882693,"In humans, exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) results in varied infection and disease outcomes. 5-
10% of individuals infected with Mtb manifest disease, with evidence of infection in the remaining majority
evinced only as positivity of IGRA (interferon gamma release assay). Given that the risk of developing
reactivation TB is ~10% per lifetime in immunocompetent LTBI, it is thought the anti-TB immunity developed in
this population can control the infection rather effectively. Another group, termed resisters, are defined as
persons who remain IGRA-negative despite prolonged heavy exposure to Mtb. Resisters, compared to LTBI
subjects, exhibit an interferon (IFN)γ-independent T cell response. The non-IFNγ T cell response to Mtb antigens
(Ags), in conjunction with class switch recombination and the relatively high binding affinity Abs developed in
resisters, suggests that this population has been infected with and has established an adaptive immune response
to Mtb. Our Brazil household contact (HHCs) study of pulmonary TB showed differential IGRA response in the
exposed HHCs despite having similar exposure to the infectious index case. Approximately 45% of HHCs were
found to be IGRA negative. We defined the resister IGRA negative group as “Resistant to IGRA Conversion”
(RIC) and the IGRA positive group as IGRA Converters (IC). Our preliminary data show that IFNγ-independent
adaptive T cell immunity is engaged in RIC-HHCs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from RIC-HHCs
restrict Mtb growth. Further, preliminary data points to GM-CSF-secreting T cells as a likely component of the
IFNγ-independent T cell response. GM-CSF signaling enhances IL-1β production and given that IL-1β is critical
to anti-bacterial immunity in TB, we hypothesize that stable GM-CSF secreting memory T cells contribute to the
RIC phenotype and the cytokine may also have a significant role in IC-HHCs. Accumulating evidence suggests
that antibodies (Abs) play a role in regulating infection and disease outcomes in individuals exposed to Mtb,
including the RIC- and IC-HHCs. We showed that Tfh cells (the CD4 T helper cell that is essential for the
development of the B cell and Ab responses) from LTBI subjects harbor phenotypically distinct subsets that have
been linked to discrepant B cell-regulatory functions in varied immunological systems. We thus posit that varied
functions of Tfh cells in individuals exposed to Mtb may influence infection outcome by directing the development
of distinct Ab responses. Comparative characterization of anti-TB immunity in RIC-HHCs versus IC-HHCs is a
major goal of this proposal. The proposed studies will likely illuminate the IFNγ-independent T cell mediated
immunological mechanisms that define the RIC phenotype, and of protective mechanisms mediated by the Tfh
cell-B cell-Ab axis--this may lead to the development of novel vaccine targets. We will reconsent HHCs, retest
them for their IGRA status and then recruit to the study the ones who have maintained their original IGRA
phenotype. Our aims are: i) Elucidate the IFN-γ-independent T cell response in RIC-HHC in comparison to IC-
HHC; ii) Characterize the B cell, Ab, and cTfh responses of RIC-HHCs and IC-HHCs."

epidemiologically linked to increased risk of lung, skin, bladder, and liver cancer, but there is large inter-individual
variability in cancers among similarly exposed individuals, indicating other important factors are involved in
disease penetrance. We showed the gut microbiome is an important determinant in arsenicosis and this project
continues to evaluate which microbiome-arsenic interactions provide the most benefits during exposure. This
includes engineering bacteria to evaluate specific microbiome-driven arsenical metabolisms in the gut of
gnotobiotic mice, focusing specifically on reduction, methylation, and thiolation pathways (Aim 1). We also found
antibiotic perturbation of the murine microbiome significantly increases the toxicity of inorganic arsenic and leads
to inter-individual differences in lethality. At least some of these differences appear to result from sepsis or
sepsis-like disease also observed in human arsenic poisoning. We will quantify the impact of commonly
prescribed antibiotics on arsenic toxicity and test whether microbiome manipulation can be used to rescue
arsenic-attributable sepsis (Aim 2). This information is important given the large number of individuals treated
with antibiotics in the US and countries around world. PD/PI's Walk and McDermott have had success leading
this multidisciplinary research program since 2017. The research new team members and collaborators with
years of training and technical expertise in murine models of the gut microbiome, microbial ecology, molecular
biology, arsenical speciation, clinical pharmacology, and immunology. Collectively, the assembled team will
ensure the continued success of a highly productive research effort into microbiome-arsenic-host interactions."
10882873,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is the most common HPV-
related cancer in the U.S. While vaccinations against HPV are available, they will not substantially reduce
incidence until 2060. In the absence of screening programs, patients typically present with advanced disease
requiring treatment with lifelong consequences and early mortality. Two blood-based biomarkers, serum
antibodies to HPV16 early (E) oncoproteins (HPV16 E Abs) and circulating tumor-modified HPV DNA
(ctmHPVDNA), are highly sensitive and specific. Persistent oncogenic HPV at anogenital sites is a biomarker of
anal and cervical cancer risk, though limited data exists on oral oncogenic HPV natural history and persistence
as a risk factor for HPV-related OPC. This proposal capitalizes on a funded (CPRIT: RP2000025) OPC screening
trial (1500 men; TRINITY Study: NCT 02897427) and would extend this work outside of a clinical trial design to
explore both novel assays and self-collection and include women and those with limited health care access.
Objective: To evaluate test characteristics, feasibility, and acceptance of non-invasive self-collected samples for
HPV-related cancer screening and monitoring. Hypothesis: Novel self-sampling approaches / assays are feasible
with equivalent performance to clinic-based / blood sampling and will be acceptable to both patients and the
general population. To accomplish these objectives, the following specific aims are proposed:
Aim 1: OPC Patient Cohort: To establish test characteristics of novel ctmHPVDNA and HPV16 E Ab
assays using self-collected oral rinse, unstimulated saliva, and urine samples compared to tumor HPV
status and clinic-based / blood samples.
Aim 2: General Population Cohort: To document the feasibility of remote self-sampling (oral rinse, saliva,
and urine) for novel ctmHPVDNA and HPV16 E Ab assays, as well as presence of oral oncogenic HPV.
Design: A prospective cohort study of 100 patients with OPC (Aim 1), and 1,100 individuals aged 45-69 years
from the general population (Aim 2). Presence of ctmHPVDNA will be determined using the NavDx assay
(Naveris, Waltham, MA). HPV16 E Ab testing will be performed using a RAPID ELISA (ASU). Oral oncogenic
HPV testing of oral rinse samples will be completed using Roche Cobas system with type-specific analysis using
the SPF10-PCR-DEIA-LiPA25 assay. For Aim 1, test characteristics of the biomarker assays will be calculated
based on the reference standard, OPC tumor HPV status. The new tests will also be compared to the non-
reference standard (blood). For Aim 2, descriptive statistics will document successful completion rates of self-
sampling and subsequent assay testing, and clinical findings described for the biomarker positive. Prevalence
and 18-month persistence of oral oncogenic HPV will also be documented for the general population cohort."

 Metabolic health depends on maintaining normal mass and function of adipose tissue (AT). Accumulation of
excess body fat or pathological loss of AT is associated with insulin resistance and cardiometabolic diseases.
White and brown adipose tissues act together to maintain a balance between fat accumulation and energy
expenditure. Upstream players that regulate AT maintenance remain less characterized. Ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-
like proteins modify diverse protein substrates and expand the functional diversity of the proteome. However,
the functional role of NEDD8, a novel Ub-like protein with the highest homology with Ub, remains poorly
understood in adipose tissue. Neddylation covalently attaches NEDD8 to target proteins via NEDD8-specific E1-
E2-E3 enzymes. Induced adipose deletion of NAE1 (a regulatory subunit of the only NEDD8 E1 enzyme) in mice
resulted in the loss of adipose tissue potentially through mitochondrial dysfunction. Pharmacological inhibition of
neddylation promoted mitochondrial ROS production and impaired mitochondrial function in mature adipocytes.
Interestingly, adipocyte-specific loss of CUL3 (a bona fide neddylation target) largely phenocopied neddylation
deficiency-induced AT loss, and neddylation dominantly targets CUL3 to modulate mitochondrial function and
adipocyte turnover. These compelling preliminary data form the basis of our central hypothesis that
neddylation is required for mature adipose tissue maintenance through regulating CUL3-mediated
mitochondrial function. Aim 1 will establish the significance and identify the proteome of neddylation in
regulating mitochondrial dysfunction, adipose tissue remodeling, and thus energy homeostasis. Aim 2 will
dissect the molecular basis by which neddylation targets a novel mitochondrial targeted CUL3 E3 Ub ligase to
mediate adipocyte mitochondrial function and turnover, thus energy balance. Our proposed study will provide
the most in-depth analysis of neddylation as a novel post-translational modification essential for adipose tissue
maintenance. We expect that new findings from this proposal will provide fundamental insights into our
understanding of the role of posttranslational modifications in the pathophysiology of adipose tissue and its
implications on obesity/lipodystrophy and its associated metabolic disorders."
10882633,"The long-term goal of our laboratory is to develop successful neuroprotective treatments for glaucoma.
Glaucoma is a blinding disease for which neuroprotective treatments are desperately needed. In the visual
system, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) conduct impulses to the visual cortex via RGC axons which form the optic
nerve (ON). Loss of RGCs and their axons are the underlying cellular cause of many optic neuropathies including
glaucoma. RGC axons are particularly vulnerable to damage at the optic nerve head (ONH) where ONH
astrocytes (ONHAs) are the main glial cell. This proposal focuses on sigma-1 receptor (S1R) as a promising
therapeutic target in glaucoma. S1R is a ligand operated molecular chaperone that generally elicits pro-survival
responses via regulation of protein-protein interactions. Although activation of S1R using the canonical ligand
(+)-pentazocine (PTZ) reduces axon loss in a rat microbead model of glaucoma, the cell-specific mechanisms
by which S1R provides this neuroprotection are not well-known. Here, we investigate a novel function of S1R as
a regulator of the ONHA secretome. Previous studies indicate that S1R interacts with proteins mediating
secretion and in vitro experiments suggest that the presence of S1R in ONHAs is required for supporting RGC
health in co-culture experiments. Three specific aims are proposed to investigate the central hypothesis that S1R
mediates neuroprotection in RGCs by regulating the ONHA secretome. Aim 1 uses novel cell-specific S1R
knockout (KO) mice to determine the extent to which S1R in astrocytes versus RGCs is necessary for
neuroprotection using the microbead and silicone oil models of glaucoma. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that S1R
regulates the ONHA secretome to enable RGC protection. A combination of molecular and genetic approaches
are used to tag, concentrate, and identify secreted proteins in ONHA-conditioned media with/without S1R
activation and in presence/absence of ocular hypertension and ER stress. Comparison of the changing
secretome under different conditions will identify specific components with the potential to promote RGC survival.
Aim 3 addresses the molecular pathways induced in RGCs by the S1R-mediated ONHA secretome. A
combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches will be used to investigate how S1R in ONHAs alters RGC
mitochondrial localization and metabolism. In addition, we will determine transcriptome and translatome changes
that occur in RGCs upon exposure to the ONHA secretome. Successful completion of this proposal will identify
new therapeutic targets within the astrocyte secretome. Modulating the astrocyte secretome offers a novel
druggable approach to mitigate factors leading to RGC death."

Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, prompting molecular mechanisms to promote tumor survival,
growth, and resistance to treatment. Therapeutic targeting of tumor metabolism therefore is believed to be a
promising avenue of cancer treatment. To further the development of metabolism-targeted cancer therapy,
more information is needed concerning the heterogeneity of tumor metabolism and how tumor type, stage, and
other tumor/patient characteristics determine the metabotype of tumors. Although publicly available resources
exist for genomics and proteomics data, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Human Proteome
Atlas (HPA), no such database exists for the cancer metabolome. Resources like TCGA and HPA have
become cornerstones of cancer research, making the lack of a cancer metabolome resource a glaring
omission, particularly since metabolomics is considered to be the omics closest to phenotype. We propose to
create the Human Cancer Metabolome Atlas (HCMA) by collecting metabolomics data on numerous patient-
derived tumors and making an open-access resource to the cancer community to better understand the role of
metabolism in cancers. In Aim 1,we will analyze a large-scale collection (>2000) patient-derived xenografts
(PDXs) using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. We will obtain these PDXs from NCI’s patient derived
model repository (PDMR), Charles River Laboratory, and Crown Bioscience. Each PDX model has already
been characterized by RNA-sequencing, whole exome sequencing, and comes with a wealth of patient
information/metadata. In Aim 2, we will evaluate how metabotypes of PDXs vary based on gene expression
patterns, presence of metastatic disease, and survival outcomes. Using a combination of univariate,
multivariate, and pathway analyses, we will uncover key roles of cancer metabolism in these processes and
which aspects of cancer metabolism contribute to heterogeneity across patients. Finally, in Aim 3 we will create
a public resource for the HCMA using the National Metabolomics Data Repository (NMDR, also known as
Metabolomics Workbench). Raw and processed metabolomics data will be uploaded to this resource along
with associated patient metadata and existing genetic data to facilitate data mining and discovery efforts to be
performed by outside investigators. Existing data analysis modules of the NMDR including univariate analysis,
multivariate analysis, pathway analysis, and metabolite class analysis will be integrated with the HCMA to
make the metabolomics data accessible and easily analyzable by other investigators. This resource will
continually be built upon in future proposals to expand the HCMA and provide a powerful resource for new
discoveries in cancer biology and therapeutics."

Members of the Myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors play prominent roles in the
differentiation of the musculature, and changes in MEF2 function are strongly associated with human disease
mechanisms. Central to understanding the mechanistic basis of MEF2-dependent disease is an understanding
of the normal function of this important factor. Research over many years has uncovered numerous cofactors
that impact MEF2 function, however we still lack a full understanding of the global regulation of MEF2 function
during muscle development, and of how that process goes awry in the diseased state.
 Our research uses the Drosophila model system, whose genome contains a single Mef2 gene, thus
obviating complications arising from genetic redundancy. In addition, Drosophila contains muscle types similar
to those in humans, and which are specified using mechanisms that are conserved across the animal kingdom.
Therefore, the developmental and disease mechanisms that we uncover in flies will be directly relevant to
understanding human health. Drosophila also is highly amenable to genetic manipulation and genetic screens.
 During the current period of support, we have used a range of approaches to identify and characterize
interactions and modifications of MEF2 that regulate its function, and we have uncovered new global
mechanisms that impact MEF2 in the contexts of both development and disease. In this proposal, we will test
the overarching hypothesis that MEF2 function is regulated by dueling positively and negatively acting
processes, and we will carry out both hypothesis-driven and genetic screening approaches to understand this
regulation at the molecular level. In Aim 1 we will determine mechanistically how MEF2 function in myoblasts is
restrained by epigenetic mechanisms and test the hypothesis that the NuRD complex functions in this process.
In Aim 2 we will define the in vivo functional significance of MEF2 interaction with P38 MAPK and define how
this post-translational modification of MEF2 affects interactions with the processes characterized in Aim 1.
These approaches will provide novel and impactful new insight into the mechanisms of MEF2 function, and
how mutations affecting MEF2 can result in human disease."

graduate students at Duke University. The program has maintained its status over the years as an elite
graduate training program by co-evolving with changes in experimental and analytical technologies,
scientific culture, career development, and student demographics. Currently, the UPGG is a degree-
granting program of approximately 50 students and 90 faculty with appointments in departments across
the School of Medicine, School of Engineering, and Arts & Sciences. UPGG students have the
opportunity to train in a broad range of fundamental research questions including chromosomes,
nucleic acids, and gene expression; developmental genetics, population and evolutionary genetics;
model systems genetics, human and mammalian genetics, plant genetics; and microbial and viral
genetics. Our faculty train students in experimental and quantitative/analytical approaches across a
variety of biological systems from microbes to plants to humans. This intellectual diversity, coupled with
Duke’s highly collaborative culture, has created a truly interdisciplinary training environment. Our UPGG
alumni populate a breadth of career paths from traditional academic research and teaching to
industrial/government research or regulatory affairs, and small startup companies to big pharma. Our
current trainees come from a variety of scientific, cultural, and socioeconomic backgrounds. This
diverse population participates actively in their own training by organizing some of our signature
programs, such as the annual student retreat, distinguished lecture series, and community outreach
efforts. Additional programmatic offerings such as our Tuesday Seminar Series serve as a focal point
for bringing together the entire Genetics and Genomics community together at Duke. In the coming
grant period, we seek to leverage the current strengths and successes of the UPGG along with
developing new programmatic and curricular offerings that support the intellectual and career
development of our trainees. Our objective is to utilize the backdrop of genetics and genomics research
at Duke to produce independent scientists who are well trained in the fundamental technical,
leadership, and operational skills necessary for them to thrive in a range of scientific career paths. As
part of our focus on student training, we will develop mechanisms for improving the mentoring skills of
our training faculty who play a critical role in the intellectual development of our trainees. Finally, we will
ensure that our training environment continues to be one in which all of our students can flourish."

This proposal requests renewed support for a robust and successful postdoctoral training program at the Salk
Institute. Under the guidance of a new leadership team, co-Directors Drs. Susan Kaech and Geoffrey Wahl have
renamed the Salk T32 Cancer Training Program the “Cancer Heterogeneity, Immunity, and Microenvironment
(CHIME) Training Program,” reflecting: 1) a revitalized program now focused on cancer heterogeneity (within
each tumor and across different cancer types and individuals), cancer immunity, and the tumor
microenvironment, 2) the evolving and diverse expertise of the T32 Program Faculty and members of Salk’s
NCI-designated Cancer Center, and 3) technologies now available in Salk’s Scientific Core Facilities that enable
researchers to attack cancer from these diverse vantage points. Major research interests of the Program Faculty
include cancer metabolism, immunology, autophagy, mitochondrial biology, genomic/epigenetic variability, and
computational biology, which coalesce into the two research programs of the Salk Cancer Center: Genetic,
Epigenetic & Immune Circuits, and Animal Models of Cancer & Therapeutics. The Salk Cancer Center includes
36 faculty members, 29 of whom are members of the T32 Program Faculty. There are ~160 postdoctoral trainees
in the Salk Cancer Center, representing a robust and highly qualified applicant pool. The overall goal of the T32
Training Program is to provide Fellows with the research training and career development opportunities that will
enable them to launch successful careers in cancer biology research. Training elements available exclusively to
T32 Fellows (i.e., those that add value to their training experience over other Salk trainees) include: 1) a Pulling
Back the Curtain Workshop – a partnership with the UCSD Moores Comprehensive Cancer Center that includes
meetings with oncologists and clinical researchers, as well as participation in Cancer Rounds and Molecular
Tumor Board Meetings, 2) a Tumor Heterogeneity Workshop delivered by Salk Core Directors and Faculty, 3)
the ability to present their research-in-progress annually in the Cancer Center Trainee Research Seminar Series,
4) Chalk Talk Tutorials, 5) opportunities to organize the yearly T32 Cancer Symposium, and 6) frequent
interactions with the co-Directors, the T32 Steering Committee, and the T32 External Advisory Board. Additional
career development opportunities include courses on Cancer Biology, Modern Drug Discovery, and Responsible
Conduct of Research, as well as workshops on Emerging Technologies, Grant Writing, Entering Mentoring, and
Rigor and Reproducibility. The Salk Postdoctoral Office also provides a wide range of career development
opportunities. This training program will support six postdoctoral trainees (PhD, MD/PhD, or MD) selected as
T32 Fellows based on the strength and cancer relevance of their research proposal, their prior achievements,
and an interview. Fellowships are for two years, with the potential for a third year if the Fellow demonstrates
progress and has applied for external support. This rigorous Training Program will equip each T32 Fellow with
the scientific and career skills necessary to establish themselves as successful, independent cancer researchers."

The candidate is a medicinal chemist and veterinary pathologist in the Department of Pathobiology and
Diagnostic Investigation at Michigan State University (MSU). Her research interests focus on the preparation of
small molecules to abrogate the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
and related tauopathies, while other groups have sought aggregation inhibitors using recombinant tau that was
not post-translationally modified. This K08 application will provide Dr. Jessica Fortin with the support necessary
to accomplish 5 goals: 1) to gain knowledge on the pharmaceutical properties of potent abrogating molecules
of p-tau fibrillization (ADME: absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion); 2) to apply knowledge for
optimization of chemical structures; 3) to advance skills in conducting PK/PD studies in mice; 4) to integrate a
mouse model for proof of concept studies; 5) to develop an independent research program in the neuroscience
area of drug discovery. To achieve these goals and foster expertise in drug discovery, neuroscience, and
translational research, Dr. Fortin has assembled a multi-disciplinary mentoring team comprised of Dr. Richard
Neubig (primary mentor), a leader in drug discovery and development, and 5 co-mentors and one collaborator:
Dr. Edmund Ellsworth and Dr. Babak Borhan, pioneers in medicinal chemistry and organic chemistry; Dr. Min-
Hao Kuo, a pioneer in molecular biology of p-tau aggregation inhibitors; and Dr. Scott Counts, Dr. David Morgan,
and Dr. Nicholas Kanaan (collaborator), pioneers in the design of translational studies using animal model of tau
deposition. MSU has strong programs in drug discovery in multiple Departments.
This project will enable Dr. Fortin to build a drug discovery program to inhibit aggregation of p-tau and its
associated neurotoxicity, and propel small molecules to preclinical studies in drug development and proof of
concept studies using a mouse model of tauopathies. Notably, Aim 1 organizes lead optimization steps prior to
the preclinical stage of our drug discovery program. Aim 1 will allow the best novel p-tau aggregation inhibitors
to be propelled to a higher level of testing to obtain preclinical data using the following: solubility test, protein
binding assay, Caco-2 cell culture, P-glycoprotein substrate and inhibition assay, microsomal stability assay, and
a blood-brain barrier in vitro model. Aim 2 will evaluate PK/PD, safety, and brain permeability of 4 best
compounds in the same mouse strain to be used in Aim 3. As a proof of concept in Aim 3, the two best novel
molecules will be tested for long-term reduction of neurodegeneration in a transgenic mouse model (PS19
P301S) of tauopathies. The model harbors the same human tau isoform used in the screening program. This
grant will provide the training and support for Dr. Fortin to be integrated into the MSU College of Veterinary
Medicine, allowing for an additional R01 proposal for the discovery and development of small molecule
therapeutics in AD and related tauopathies. This will facilitate Dr. Fortin’s development into an independent
researcher and contributor in the neuroscience drug discovery community."

Tumors have distinctive metabolism. These distinguishing metabolic features enable both cancer diagnosis and
therapy. Due to fast glucose metabolism, tumors light up by fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging. Due to enhanced
nucleotide synthesis, they are susceptible to antifolates, which are first-line therapies for leukemia (methotrexate)
and lung cancer (pemetrexed). New facets of tumor metabolism continue to be discovered. Previously, co-PIs
White and Rabinowitz contributed to the identification of autophagy and macropinocytosis as non-canonical
means of cancer cell nutrient acquisition. Recently, they identified thrifty energy metabolism in tumors: by
shedding normal tissue functions, tumors can grow and divide despite making less energy than most normal
tissues. While valuable, up to now studies measuring tumor metabolic activity (e.g. with isotope tracing and mass
spectrometry) have mainly studied the tumor as a whole. In the current era of immunotherapy, the insufficiency
of this approach is painfully clear. Whole tumor measurements confound the metabolism of cancer cells and
cancer-fighting immune cells. To resolve metabolism in tumors with cell type specificity, new methods are
needed. Here we will develop and deploy such methods. The resulting knowledge will provide the basis for
manipulating metabolism more effectively to help fight cancer. Aim 1 will determine, in state-of-the-art mouse
modes, in vivo central metabolic fluxes (glycolysis, TCA) across different tumor cell types and during active
response to immunotherapy. Aim 2 will measure how different tumor cell types obtain nucleotides. Nucleic acid
synthesis is a clinically proven cancer vulnerability but at the same time, nucleotide synthesis inhibitors can also
impair immune cells. We will assess nucleotide synthesis and scavenging, and how it changes in response to
anti-folates. Defining the dynamics of nucleotide metabolism in vivo with cellular resolution will inform the
metabolic relationship between tumor and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Aim 3 will explore the
interplay between autophagy, metabolism, and antitumor immunity. Autophagy supports tumor cell metabolism,
and host autophagy supplies nutrients to tumors and dampens antitumor immunity. We will use mouse genetics,
nutrient supplementation, single cell transcriptomics, and in vivo isotope-tracing of host and tumor metabolism
to define underlying mechanisms. The net impact of these efforts will be (i) broadly useful methods for tracking
metabolism in action across cell types, (ii) fundamental knowledge of the metabolic feedstocks and pathways
used by different tumor cells, and (iii) next-generation metabolic strategies for treating cancer."

 PROJECT SUMMARY
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease involving genetic and environmental
factors culminating in multiple detrimental comorbidities. One such comorbidity is the onset of what is referred
to as CNS lupus (NP-SLE). Despite the impact of NP-SLE on health-related quality of life and although numerous
mechanisms have been proposed, none can solely account for NP-SLE pathogenesis. We published that
expression of NP-SLE-specific disease signatures in tissue-resident macrophages in the brain correlates with
the severity of behavioral deficits in two NP-SLE models prior to overt systemic disease. Further, our single-cell
RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data identify homeostatic and disease-associated states in tissue-resident
macrophages of aged control and NP-SLE-prone mice. However, the disease-associated macrophage subset
in NP-SLE is depleted for genes associated with phagocytosis, which is in contrast to their known phagocytic
role in other diseases. We also find that restricted expression of the disease-associated transcriptional program
in NP-SLE tissue-resident macrophages corresponds to improved behavioral outcomes in NP-SLE-prone mice
following treatment with fingolimod. These discoveries mark the first to implicate this disease-associated tissue-
resident macrophage subset as a potentially pathogenic population in NP-SLE, which contrasts with their
proposed protective role in the literature. We hypothesize that pathogenic disease-associated tissue-
resident macrophages in the brain are crucial for NP-SLE development and targeting this population
may represent a new therapeutic avenue for treating NP-SLE. In Aim 1, we will determine whether tissue-
resident brain cells or infiltrating immune cells are required for NP-SLE using reciprocal head-shielded bone
marrow chimeric mice of WT and NP-SLE-prone donors and recipients. We will test whether blocking transition
from the homeostatic state to the disease-associated state via deletion of TREM2 (a critical functional regulator
of this population) in tissue-resident macrophages prevents NP-SLE. We will delineate the role that type I
interferon (IFN) plays in the development of NP-SLE-like disease by examining the role for the upstream receptor
(IFNAR) and downstream signaling protein IFN regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), which have been linked to SLE
susceptibility, via deletion of these signaling mediators in tissue-resident macrophages. We identified a cell
subset in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that transcriptionally resembles disease-associated tissue-resident
macrophages. Moreover, classical monocytes can repopulate a compromised tissue-resident macrophage niche
and we see numerical expansion of these cells in NP-SLE models. In Aim 2, we will obtain paired CSF and
peripheral blood (PB) from SLE patients with and without NP-SLE for transcriptional profiling of CSF
macrophages and PB monocytes to correlate with clinical outcomes. Despite investigation of tissue-resident
macrophages in the brain in other disciplines, we will be the first to examine their role in NP-SLE. These data
will be invaluable for downstream development of improved diagnostics or targeted therapies."

The Mechanism of Virus-Host Interactions Training Grant is a multidisciplinary training program designed to
train and educate pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees in the broad discipline of Virology. This proposal
requests continued support for years 21-25 of the Virology Training Program. The faculty is derived from the
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) with Dr. Tortorella as the Program Director and Dr. Peter
Palese as the Co-Program Director. The research training emphasis is directed toward teaching pre-doctoral
and post-doctoral trainees the theory and experimental approaches required for independent scientific
investigations. Trainees learn the molecular mechanisms involved in virus replication and host responses to
viral infections. Research training areas also include novel approaches for antiviral strategies and vaccine
development against medically relevant viruses. Our trainees are highly successful in attaining independent
research positions, peer-reviewed publications, and extramural research funding. Accordingly, four pre-
doctoral and three post-doctoral positions are requested. The specific aim of the program is to recruit and
provide rigorous training to high caliber students and fellows. The continued support of this program will aid
trainees in all phases of their development including understanding scientific method, interpretation of results,
presentation of data and conclusions, research ethics, and career guidance. By combining the strengths of an
outstanding group of virologists, we have created a world-class virology Training Program. This program is
built upon existing collaborations, including research grants, and joint publications between faculty members at
ISMMS. The program faculty consists of twenty outstanding virologists who use a diverse array of experimental
strategies to study the molecular, cellular, biochemical and immunological interactions of viruses with their

 Blood vessels must be properly shaped and placed and have a hierarchical organization with characteristic
and distinct calibers to perform their vital circulatory function. In particular, vascular caliber is the primary
determinant of blood flow properties. Thus, abnormalities in luminal morphometry disrupt blood circulation
and decrease cardiovascular health. We found that Semaphorin-Plexind1 (Sema-Plxnd1) signaling, known for
its role in guiding the anatomical patterning of the vasculature, plays a novel blood flow-dependent role in
determining the caliber of the axial midline vessels (the major artery and vein of the body). Our aims are as
follows. (1) To define the signaling pathways and cellular mechanisms by which Plxnd1, its Sema3 ligands, and
blood flow regulate the caliber of these vessels. (2) To define the structural bases of Plxnd1-dependent vessel
caliber sizing and the role of Semas and flow forces as modulators of Plxnd1 expression, apicobasal targeting,
and flow mechanosensing activity. We will use zebrafish as our primary model system to exploit its unique
experimental advantages for studying vascular development, function, and signaling in vivo. We will also
perform experiments with mice to determine if the receptor's novel role is conserved in mammals. Finally, to
further illuminate how Sema ligands and circulatory forces modulate Plexin-D1 expression, localization, and
function, we will perform studies with human endothelial cell systems under tunable flow conditions."

Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer. Advanced melanoma is very aggressive and, despite
advances in therapeutics, continues to have a low survival rate. Immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint
blockade (ICB) benefited many melanoma patients. While encouraging, there remains an unmet need as most
patients do not respond to ICB. ICB therapeutic efficacy can be promoted by vaccine formulations that deliver
tumor-associated antigens and neoantigens. Chemically-defined peptide vaccines are attractive for relatively
easy manufacturing and good pharmaceutical stability. The success of peptide vaccines relies on the efficiency
of delivery. Despite clinical testing of various peptide vaccine formulations, their therapeutic efficacy has been
limited due to a number of delivery issues including: 1) poor vaccine delivery to the site of action, 2) limited co-
delivery of immunostimulant adjuvants and antigens to enhance antigen immunogenicity, 3) the limited ability to
overcome tumor heterogeneity, and 4) the limited ability to deliver physicochemically heterogeneous antigens.
Our strategy is to develop a high efficiency and targeted peptide vaccine platform for ICB combination therapy
that addresses each of these deficiencies: 1) albumin hitchhiking will be used to deliver peptide vaccines to
lymph nodes and antigen-presenting cells (APCs), 2) potent adjuvants and adjuvant/antigen co-delivery will be
employed to enhance antigen immunogenicity, 3) a modular system will deliver multi-antigens to overcome tumor
heterogeneity, and 4) a widely applicable system will deliver various peptide antigens. In our preliminary studies,
we developed albumin-binding vaccines (AlbiVax) to enhance vaccine delivery to lymph nodes and APCs 100-
fold in mice, relative to a clinical benchmark. AlbiVax promoted anticancer immune responses 14-fold, and
improved melanoma therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, by co-delivering a potent di-adjuvant and antigens using an
albumin-hitchhiking nanoscaffold, we further potentiated antigen immunogenicity and promoted melanoma
therapeutic efficacy. Our objective in this study is to engineer multi-antigen/di-adjuvant co-delivery AlbiVax
(mADC-AlbiVax) as an efficient platform that co-delivers potent adjuvants and heterogenous peptide antigens
to lymph nodes and APCs, whereby eliciting potent, broad, and long-lasting immunity for ICB melanoma
combination immunotherapy. Aim 1 will optimize the modular structure of model mADC-AlbiVax to co-deliver
vaccines to lymph nodes, APCs, and subcellular locations in APCs for optimal antitumor immunomodulation;
Aim 2 will synthesize melanoma mADC-AlbiVax, and study vaccine co-delivery and immunomodulation; and Aim
3 will evaluate the melanoma therapeutic efficacy and safety of this vaccine delivery system, alone or combined
with ICB, in mouse models. This project led by an independent, productive ESI is supported by extensive
preliminary data and a complementary team. A significant deliverable from this work will preclinically establish a
vaccine delivery system using chemically-defined vaccines and clinically tested or used agents for future clinical
evaluation.

Determinants of Health, which features a unique, cross-disciplinary focus on integrating
research in human populations and animal models. Through these activities, as well as support
for conference travel and short-term collaborative visits, the ENC will identify promising faculty
and trainees with an interest in aging research and provide crucial early stage support to grow
the aging research community. Additionally, to showcase cutting-edge, emerging work in
behavioral and social research on aging, the ENC will support themed workshops and symposia
on topics of interest to the CPHA community. These events, in combination with the established,
CPHA-supported annual meeting, “Demography Daze,” will feature important research
advances, catalyze new opportunities for collaboration, and motivate new research directions
within and outside Duke. The ENC thus takes advantage of the exceptional community of
biosocial researchers at Duke, while simultaneously building connections with faculty and
trainees on a regional, national, and global scale. It therefore advances the overarching aims of
the P30 proposal as a whole, with particular relevance to integrating social science and life
science approaches to understand aging across the life course."
10886639,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The Cancer Invasion and Metastasis Program (CIM) is a new Program within the Sidney Kimmel
Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC). CIM was launched to elucidate and target the mechanisms driving
metastasis, as metastasis is the major driver of patient outcomes. The Program consists of highly
accomplished basic scientists working collaboratively with engineers and translational physician-scientists. The
Co-Leaders are Andrew Ewald, Ph.D. (basic, invasion focused); Ashani Weeraratna, Ph.D. (basic, tumor
microenvironment focused); and Phuoc Tran, M.D., Ph.D (basic/clinical, recurrent disease focused). CIM is
comprised of 42 Members (31 Full Members and eleven Associate Members) from three schools and 16
departments at Johns Hopkins University. Faculty are affiliated with four T-32 training grants across the School
of Medicine, School of Public Health, and School of Engineering. The total direct cancer-relevant peer-
reviewed funding is $14.1 million, with $8.3 million from the National Cancer Institute. The total number of
publications by Program members is 768, of which 129 (16.8%) are Intra-Programmatic, 412 (53.8%) are Inter-
Programmatic and 487 (63.4%) have external collaborations. Of these publications, 20.6% are in journals with
impact factors >10 and 5.7% in journals with impact factors >25. The Aims of the Program are: Aim 1: To
elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating individual and collective cancer cell motility and
invasion across organ sites using cutting-edge models and tools. Aim 2: To define the regulation of cancer
function by the cellular, molecular and mechanical features of the tumor microenvironment. Investigators target
and disrupt the crosstalk between the cancer cell and the metastasis-promoting microenvironment using
physiologically relevant models (e.g., organoids, 3D skin reconstruction, cell-derived matrices, humanized
animal models). Aim 3: To determine and disrupt the underlying cause of recurrent cancer at the cellular and
molecular level by targeting barriers to therapeutic success in cancer, including therapy resistance, tumor
dormancy and recurrent disease. Research success across these aims is critically enabled by SKCCC Shared
Resources (Oncology Tissue and Imaging Services, Experimental and Computational Genomics, Flow/Mass
Cytometry and Technology Development, and Mass Spectrometry Molecular Imaging and Multi-Omics).
Program members lead a P01 grant to understand microenvironmental regulation of therapy resistance and
metastasis in melanoma, and a U54 that integrates physical science and translational perspectives to
understand cancer invasion. Members also participate in three SPOREs (Prostate, GI, Head and Neck) and six
MPI U01 grants."
10886641,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) defines the state of Maryland as its catchment
area. Marylanders accounted for 4,625 out of 6,722 (69%) of the SKCCC's newly diagnosed cancer cases in
2020. Maryland is quite diverse racially, ethnically and socioeconomically, with substantial urban, rural and
suburban communities. Of the 50 states, Maryland has the highest median family income and has among the
highest proportion of college graduates. The state also has substantial poverty that fosters cancer disparities.
The Maryland Department of Health divides the state into five regions. Community Outreach and Engagement
(COE) staff maintain a database of cancer demographics, health behaviors and availability of care by region.
Certain areas of the state have cancer death rates that are lower than the national average. Certain areas have
death rates far higher than the national average. Epidemiologists in the SKCCC Office of COE work to define the
areas of need and apply the interventions that can reduce disparities. The SKCCC recruited Otis Brawley, M.D.,
as a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor and Associate Director for COE. He worked with community and staff to
author a COE strategic plan, to build the Office of COE, restructured to increase community input and direction,
and launched high-impact signature initiatives in outreach and cancer control. Infrastructure was built to facilitate
communication within the Cancer Center and communication to and involvement of the community the SKCCC
serves. The infrastructure is designed to encourage bidirectional communication with the community. The
SKCCC COE's philosophy is to serve the community, be good listeners and understand the community. There
are three Community Advisory Groups (CAGs) in specific regions of the state that provide input and help
implement cancer control activities (two are more than ten years old). COE has convened a 17-member
Community Advisory Board (CAB) representing the state. Each CAG has representation in the CAB. The CAB
confirmed SKCCC priorities and provides strategic direction to SKCCC leadership. Each Research Program also
appoints a member as COE Liaison, funded at 5% time commitment. These Liaisons meet with the CAGs and
CAB regularly to discuss SKCCC research and learn of community needs and concerns. This process catalyzes
research pertinent to the community. COE staff, the Community Liaisons and SKCCC leadership work with
SKCCC researchers to assure community need is kept in mind. COE staff consult one on one with SKCCC
investigators on a regular basis and routinely participate in leadership meetings held in the Center. Currently,
62% of the SKCCC's extramurally funded research portfolio is catchment area relevant, addressing a locally
prevalent cancer and/or a disparate population. COE also administers approximately $2 million per year as seed
funding to stimulate research pertinent to the catchment area. This is done with CAB oversight. Discussion with
CAGs/CAB Members and SKCCC Members has led to several high-impact interventions to foster health
education, HPV vaccination and colon cancer screening."

The goal of the proposed Center to Accelerate Population Research in Alzheimer’s (CAPRA) is to serve as a
national resource to promote and accelerate observational studies that aim to inform government and
healthcare system actions to reduce the social, economic, and health burden of AD/ADRD. To achieve this
objective, CAPRA requires an administrative infrastructure that supports timely, well-designed studies using
complex population and healthcare data and incorporates input from experts locally, nationally, and
internationally. The Administrative Core for CAPRA will provide this infrastructure, management, and
communication and dissemination strategy necessary to implement the strategic vision of the CAPRA which is
to leverage the deep expertise at the University of Michigan (UM) and other institutions to enable new and
established investigators locally and nationally to initiate novel areas of AD/ADRD population research. To do
so, CAPRA will fund and support pilot studies, provide training materials, tools, and in some cases access to
secondary data relevant to AD/ADRD, and will also develop networks of experts with whom to consult and
collaborate. CAPRA’s structure and governance will include four Cores (Administrative, Pilot, External Network
and Research Resources Cores), a Steering Committee and an External Advisory Panel, all composed of
investigators across disciplines and areas of expertise that will generate the diversity of ideas necessary to
address the complex challenges posed by AD/ADRD. The foundation of CAPRA’s strength is the depth of
expertise that is represented by the leadership team and planned affiliates, the institutional supports provided
by UM, and the collaboration with the other aging centers at and outside UM. Drs. Bynum and Langa as the
Administrative core leaders have broad connections across relevant academic, healthcare, policy-making and
stakeholder groups. The CAPRA Administrative Core will serve several functions including: management of
advisory committees; administratively supporting the pilot study decision process; grants management and
tracking; providing an infrastructure for delivery of technology-enabled training support and publicly accessible
data and algorithms; coordination of in-person opportunities for scientific networking activities, and carrying out
the communications and engagement strategy across our affiliates, internal and external partners, and
stakeholders such as policy makers. The proposed CAPRA has great opportunity and potential to accelerate
the advance of the science of population and healthcare research in AD/ADRD. CAPRA’s success depends on

10886762,"Project Abstract (Pilot Core)
The overarching goal of the Center to Accelerate Population Research in Alzheimer’s (CAPRA) is to serve as a
national resource to promote and accelerate multidisciplinary research that informs the actions governments,
healthcare systems and providers can take to reduce the social, economic, and health burden of AD/ADRD.
The Pilot Core will serve a central role for achieving that goal by providing funding, resources, and networking
for investigators doing pilot studies in CAPRA’s thematic research areas. Pilot studies provide opportunities to
test promising hypotheses, stimulate investigator collaborations, and generate preliminary data for new grants.
But their small scale and short timeline can make it difficult to efficiently complete and to transition to full-scale
studies. To reduce barriers to entry for Alzheimer’s population and healthcare research, the Pilot Core is
designed to provide not only funding for pilots but also access to expertise, methods and in some cases data to
ensure success. We will solicit and select pilot studies from a diverse set of investigators that fit CAPRA’s
themes and have the best chance to develop into externally funded research projects and be most influential
for understanding and treating Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in population health. We aim to
solicit pilot studies across many disciplines, including established investigators transitioning into AD/ADRD
research. We will solicit pilot studies not only from the University of Michigan, but also from the broader
research community around the country. The solicitation strategy will access existing networks, such as
Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research, National Clinical Scholars programs, and other collaborative
groups with whom the CAPRA leadership and affiliates work. CAPRA will not merely fund promising pilot
studies, the Pilot Study Investigators will become an integral part of CAPRA. They will participate in other
CAPRA activities, creating a wider network of dementia research collaborators, and also receive ongoing
mentorship through the process of writing full R01 grant proposals. We will leverage data, methods, and
experience across all CAPRA collaborators to enhance the science and potential influence of their research.
We will achieve this through mentoring, seminars, and grant-writing workshops. Ultimately, our goal is to bring
talented researchers from many disciplines into Alzheimer’s research and seek innovative collaborative
solutions."
10886643,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 During the current project period, Developmental Funds have been essential to maintain and extend the
reach and vitality of the scientific Programs in the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC).
Specific aims of the SKCCC Developmental Funds are:
 Aim 1: To recruit cancer researchers in the strategic areas of need.
 Aim 2: To support staff investigators who are critical to the activities of the SKCCC.
 Use of these funds is closely tied to the SKCCC strategic plan, Innovation for Impact 2025. The funds have
been used to build scientific strength in a number of Research Programs, including: 1) recruiting new
investigators to build laboratory research capability across the SKCCC Research Programs and 2) recruiting
underrepresented minority (URM) faculty members. During the current project period, 16 new investigators
were recruited using $250,000 per year from Developmental Funds, including nine women and five URMs.
Fifty-one new externally funded grants were awarded to these new investigators ($6.04 million annual direct
costs which, gave a return on investment of 24 to 1), and another twelve grants are pending with an impact of
over $3.1 million annual direct costs. A total of 128 peer-reviewed articles were published by new investigators.
Developmental Funds for Shared Resources (SRs) were also used to support the Translational Research
Central Services SR, which is a fully established SR in this renewal application. In addition, although CCSG
Developmental Funds were not used, the SKCCC Intramural Grant Program funding resulted in $4.98 million
direct costs extramural grants annually, including 13 National Cancer Institute R01s, four other NIH R01s, four
U01s, four R21s, two K Awards, one U54 Project and six PPG Projects. It has also resulted in 152
publications, 14 new clinical trials and 19 patents. Developmental Funds are requested to continue new
investigator recruitment and provide support to staff investigators."
10886644,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The Director, Deputy Director and Associate Directors of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer
Center (SKCCC) comprise a select group of internationally and nationally known faculty members who have
very defined roles. They share overall responsibility for operationalizing the vision of the SKCCC. To augment
the impact of SKCCC research on cancer screening, detection, diagnosis, prevention and treatment in its
catchment area and throughout the world, the SKCCC has created a new five-year Strategic Plan, Innovation
for Impact 2025, that defines future directions, prioritizes investments and provides mechanisms for
assessment of the performance of Research Programs, Shared Resources (SRs) and other Cancer Center
activities. In doing so, the SKCCC used an approach to planning and evaluation that involved leaders, enlisted
Members, and engaged scientific and community advisors to secure advice for research planning, resource
allocation and identification of new opportunities. Implementing Innovation for Impact 2025 will proceed with
input from several key internal bodies, including an Executive Oversight Committee, Program Leaders Council,
Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee, Data Safety Monitoring Committee, Laboratory SRs Committee,
Clinical Research Operations Committee, Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination, and
Community Outreach and Engagement. The governance of the SKCCC functions with two major values:
maximizing the impact of SKCCC resources (people, space and funds) to achieve research goals, and creating
an efficient, effective, responsive and collegial environment that promotes and fosters collaborative team
science. An External Advisory Board (EAB) populated with national leaders representing major areas of cancer
research, administration and advocacy has played a critical role in the evaluation of Scientific Programs and
the re-engineering of the Programmatic structure at the SKCCC during the past CCSG funding period. EAB
Members also have generously provided individual consultations on topics reflecting their specific areas of
expertise. For the next funding period, the SKCCC will monitor the productivity and effectiveness of the
Research Programs, SRs and Senior Leaders. The SKCCC leadership team will continue to respond to EAB
criticisms earnestly and to provide reports back on the impact of EAB suggestions."
10886764,"Project Abstract (External Network Core)
Opportunities for scientists to critique and learn from each other’s research, and to sustain ongoing
multidisciplinary collaborations and synergies across research groups and studies, can strengthen the rigor of
research and accelerate the development of new knowledge. The External Network Core of the Center to
Accelerate Population Research in Alzheimer’s (CAPRA) aims to create those opportunities for
multidisciplinary collaboration and interaction by developing networks of scientists focused on high-priority
topics for policy and healthcare research related to AD/ADRD. Research in this area often takes advantage of
the growing collection and greater availability of administrative (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid) and population-
based survey data (e.g., the Health and Retirement Study international family of studies) on cognitive function,
and other novel data sources in the US and internationally. While these data are becoming more available,
their complexity and the speed at which AD/ADRD research is moving creates challenges for using them to
address important and timely questions. Development of networks of investigators from different institutions will
allow for cross-fertilization, generation of new ideas, and shared learning on how to apply sound methods
efficiently. The External Network Core is designed to use as a foundation the ongoing collaborations, expertise,
and infrastructure at the University of Michigan and recruit investigators who are junior or transitioning into
AD/ADRD research. Within the overarching theme of CAPRA, which is to develop science that informs
government and healthcare organization activities that will address the negative effects of dementia on
individuals and the population, four external networks will be established, each addressing a critical scientific
area: Diffusion of New AD/ADRD Diagnostics and Drugs; End-of-Life Treatment and Care across Systems and
Countries; Disparities and Cardiovascular Risk in Dementia; and Quality Prescribing in Alzheimer’s Disease.
We will create and sustain these research networks in a cost-effective way by using at-distance on-line and
videoconferencing collaboration strategies for regular and ongoing follow-up after initial in-person meetings.
The External Network Core will also collaborate closely with and leverage the activities of the CAPRA
Research Resources Core for dissemination of ongoing research activities of the External Network members.
In addition, the External Network Core will work closely with the Pilot Core to solicit and fund pilot projects from
External Network members, especially junior faculty members. The External Network Core will advance
science related to the demography, economics and health services research in AD/ADRD by giving
investigators, expert and newly joining the field, the benefits of sharing their expertise, opportunities for
collaboration and cross-fertilization that stimulate novel and impactful future studies."
10887456,"The Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) is a nuclear envelope
embedded multi-component complex, which mediates transport of molecules between the nucleus and
the cytoplasm. In addition to their classical function in transport, NPC components (Nups) have been
implicated in transcriptional regulation via binding to the genome. Yet what regulatory steps of
transcription are controlled by Nups and how chromatin-binding roles of Nups contribute to metazoan
development is currently unclear. We identified the binding of multiple Nups to hundreds of promoters
and enhancers in the Drosophila genome, and discovered a previously unreported role of the NPC in
the formation of enhancer-promoter loops. Specifically, we identified Nup98 to be required for the
formation of an enhancer-promoter loop at a gene activated by a developmental hormone ecdysone.
Functionally, we found that the loss of Nup98-mediated enhancer-promoter loop affected the primed
response to subsequent activation or transcriptional memory. Interestingly, ecdysone-regulated genes
stably associated with nuclear pores before and after activation, suggesting that metazoan NPCs can
be utilized as an organizing scaffold for genes awaiting future activation events. Together, these
findings implicate Nups as a new class of architectural proteins for enhancers and suggest that
stabilization of enhancer-promoter loops by nuclear pore binding constitutes a mechanism of epigenetic
maintenance. We project that this function of the nuclear pore will be highly relevant to gene regulation
during metazoan development. To be able to investigate the genome- organizing role of Nups in
developmental gene regulation, we first plan to identify molecular determinants of Nup-mediated
enhancer-promoter looping. Thus, in Aim 1, we will define which Nups and which other architectural
proteins participate in the establishment of ecdysone- induced genomic loops. Additionally, we plan to
identify DNA elements that are sufficient to tether to the NPC or that are necessary for loop
stabilization. In Aim 2, we propose to define the relationship between formation of Nup-mediated
enhancer-promoter loops and transcriptional activation and memory, by identifying chromatin changes
that occur as a specific consequence of looping. Furthermore, we will examine the effect of Nups on
maintenance of genomic loops in fly tissues during development and identify a comprehensive set of
genomic contacts that are regulated by Nups. Together, these experiments are expected to expand our
knowledge of the driving forces and principles of genome architecture, gene expression and nuclear
pore biology."

The specific objectives of the UCSD LAUNCH program are to increase the representation of scientists from backgrounds underrepresented in neurosciences in obtaining effective mentorship, critical career development skills, research training and grant funding. Three specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 is to recruit underrepresented junior faculty and transitioning postdoctoral fellows who have neuroscience scientific expertise aligned with those of our research mentors in the areas of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, cellular, developmental and molecular neurosciences and computational and systems neurosciences, particular strengths of UC San Diego. Aim 2 is to use asset models and evidence-based strategies to enhance career skill development and effective mentorship of participants using a Faculty Research and Career Advancement Plan to identify short- and long-term career and research goals, engage in effective mentorship with a 3-membered mentoring team, and extend knowledge and skills in specific career development areas. Aim 3 is to promote research training and research self-efficacy of participants by extending research knowledge, skills and strategies through direct training with a UCSD faculty research mentor and immersion in activities that will enhance research progress, collaborations and networking, grant writing skills, and as well as publication strategies that will accelerate successful research program development and submission of an NIH or equivalent grant. LAUNCH includes PIs with extensive experience in program and career development and neuroscience research, a strong cohort of UC San Diego faculty neuroscience researchers and career mentors from underrepresented backgrounds."
10882295,"Abstract/Project Summary
When admitted to the hospital, Black and Latino(a/x) children are at greater risk of medical
errors, surgical complications, longer, more-costly hospital stays, and mortality compared to
White children. Although many factors play a role, poor clinician communication likely
contributes to these disparities in health outcomes. Across settings, including our preliminary
work in the inpatient pediatric environment, Black and Latino(a/x) patients have been shown to
experience worse communication quality as evidenced by less patient and family-centered,
empathic, and respectful communication as compared to White patients. Despite robust
evidence that communication inequities exist and influence health outcomes, few have
developed and tested communication interventions with a focus on equity. To meet this
evidence gap we will test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an equity-
focused communication intervention that teaches clinicians communication skills grounded in
principles of racial equity, language justice, and structural humility. To do this, we will co-
develop and refine a clinician coaching communication intervention with iterative feedback from
Black and Latino(a/x) caregivers as well as clinicians of children in the hospital. We will then
randomize 10 clinicians to an intervention or waitlist group; clinicians in the intervention group
will receive the intervention immediately, while clinicians in the waitlist group will initially serve
as the control arm then receive the intervention to provide feasibility and acceptability data. We
will assess the feasibility of recruiting and collecting data as well as acceptability of the
intervention by clinicians. We will explore preliminary efficacy for the effect of the intervention on
clinician-caregiver communication quality. We hypothesize that our intervention will improve
clinician communication quality through increasing behaviors of partnership, affirmation,
support, respect, and interpreter best practice, which will lead to greater caregiver participation
during family-centered rounds. We will explore the effect of the intervention on caregiver
empowerment, adverse events, length of stay, and child 7 and 30 day unplanned readmission.
The new knowledge generated from the proposed research will guide our research team in
designing and conducting an NIH R01 clinical trial of the intervention to enhance the standard of
care for children admitted to the hospital."
10871292,"Personalized genetics is poised to revolutionize healthcare; however, despite advances, genetic
prediction and portability of critical variants remains too limited for clinical use. Genetic
prediction is error-prone when applied to individuals with genetic ancestries different from
discovery cohorts, often predicting disease risk little better than random in non-European
samples. We propose understanding an underlying cause of this loss of prediction accuracy by
assessing the extent of GxG interaction effects across ancestries. Using an innovative
approach, we tackle this statistically challenging problem by 1) modeling effect sizes of meQTLs
on different ancestry haplotypes in an admixed African sample from the same population --
thereby controlling for GxE, and 2) using highly heritable genome-wide methylation phenotypes,
affording us thousands of observations per participant rather than a single phenotype (e.g.
presence of cardiovascular disease). Our study design allows us to assess whether the
presence of ancestry-dependent interactions is a common factor in the variability of SNP effect
sizes across populations. Outcomes of this grant include: generating a large genome-wide
methylation dataset from 500 admixed South Africans, paired with underlying genome-wide
DNA variation. We will further estimate the fraction of meQTLs with ancestry-specific effects and
thereby comprehensively provide a snapshot of the frequency of GxG interactions in the human
genome. These results will motivate investigation of GxG effects in a broader set of biomedical
phenotypes and the extent to which they contribute to poor portability of polygenic risk across
populations."

Compared to their Non-Hispanic White peers, Non-Hispanic Black persons in the US are 79% more likely to
suffer chronic hypertension in pregnancy, 13% more likely to suffer from a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy
(HDP), and 37% more likely to experience eclampsia. They are also 94% more likely to experience severe
maternal morbidity (SMM) and 60% more likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause. Modifiable risk factors
at the individual and population levels, such as socioeconomic status, structural discrimination, and access to
healthcare, have been associated with higher incidence and severity of HDPs, and with the progression of
HDPs to SMM. These risk factors, which have also been independently linked to SMMs and pregnancy-related
mortality in the absence of HDPs, are unequally distributed along racial/ethnic lines in the state, making the
causal pathways more complex. Thus, the extent to which race/ethnicity moderates the associations between
risk factors, HDP, and SMM remains complex, making it difficult for policymakers to develop effective
strategies to combat racial/ethnic disparities in HDPs in the US. Our long-term goal is to develop interventions
that simultaneously reduce the overall burden of HDPs and reduce the racial/ethnic disparities in HDPs. Our
overall objective for this application is to develop and validate a Markov state-transition decision model of the
natural history of HDPs in the US and use that model to evaluate the potential impact of several proposed
policy solutions. Our central hypothesis is that disparities in the population distribution of modifiable risk factors
(e.g., smoking, BMI, SES, discrimination, and access to high-quality healthcare) influence the observed
racial/ethnic disparities in HDP and HDP-related SMMs in the US. Therefore, a decision model that captures
these differences will more reliably predict the future burden of HDPs in response to different policy
interventions. To achieve the project objectives, we will pursue these two specific aims: (1) Develop and
validate a Markov state-transition model of the natural history of HDP and its impact on mothers and children;
(2) Estimate the potential costs and benefits of primary prevention/treatment strategies that address racial
disparities in HDP in the United States. On completion, we expect to have developed a robust decision-support
tool that incorporates multilevel risk factors to predict differences in HDP burden by race/ethnicity, and that can
be used to test the potential effect of proposed interventions. These positive outcomes will enable the
development and implementation of evidence-based solutions to reduce HDP disparities in the US."
10873758,"ABSTRACT
Platinum compounds are the most widely used group of cytotoxic drugs worldwide. Each year more than 5.8 million
patients are diagnosed with a cancer for which first-line therapy can potentially include platinating agents. Despite over
30 years of use, there are few means of identifying patients at risk for platinum-induced ototoxicity or neuropathy who
might be offered alternative therapy or reduced-dose regimens. For patients who must receive platinum, there are no
approved preventive measures and few therapies for these toxicities. To help fill these important gaps, in our initial project
period, we established the first well-characterized clinical cohort of over 2,000 testicular cancer survivors (TCS) cured with
homogeneous cisplatin-based chemotherapy (without other ototoxic/neuropathic drugs) and made inroads into the
genetics of ototoxicity and neuropathy. Our initial project period was highly productive. We published 16 manuscripts (3
in the Journal of Clinical Oncology), plus 3 others under review. Our baseline, cross-sectional results showed that 80% of
our patients had hearing loss on audiometric testing, with 1 in 5 classified as severe-to-profound (a level at which hearing
aids are recommended); 56% had neuropathy; and 40% had tinnitus. We found that a SNP in deafness gene WFS1 that
was related to hearing loss (P=1.4x10-8) also showed a significant interaction with cisplatin dose, thus having potential
clinical impact to predict susceptibility. At a young median age (37 years), 38% of TCS already had ≥3 adverse health
outcomes (range 1-11). Given this early burden, critical unanswered questions remain and will be addressed in the next
grant cycle: (1) characterization of the longitudinal trajectory of platinum toxicities, including the role of comorbidities,
modifiable risk factors, and residual serum platinum levels; (2) the impact of toxicities on health-related quality of life and
patient functioning; and (3) further elucidation of the role of genetic variation in platinum toxicities to identify high-risk
subgroups. Our aims are: Aim 1. Characterize the longitudinal trajectory of platinum-related ototoxicity and neuropathy,
repeating audiometry, and expanding data collection for the first time to include a comprehensive set of physical and
psychosocial domains to inform the eventual development of evidence-based guidelines for TCS follow-up; Aim 2.
Evaluate for the first time the impact of cisplatin-related hearing loss, tinnitus and neuropathy and their severity on
physical, emotional and social patient functioning; Aim 3. Identify additional genetic variation that predisposes patients
to platinum-related ototoxicity and neuropathy and that influences residual serum platinum levels through genotyping
and whole exome sequencing. IMPACT: Findings derived from our unique clinical cohort will provide the first
comprehensive, longitudinal assessment of multiple platinum-related toxicities in any large, homogenously treated cohort
of adult-onset cancer survivors and help inform the eventual development of evidence-based guidelines for TCS follow-
up. Our findings will also provide the basis for the development of preventive and interventional strategies for cisplatin-
related toxicities associated not only with significant impairment of quality of life, but substantial morbidity."

cohort longitudinally questions about how CATs could be used to predict or track neurocognitive performance
and how age and long-term anti-retroviral treatment affect the auditory system can be answered. To date, the
most significant result has been demonstrating that CAT results correlate with cognitive performance. This
suggests CAT results might be useful for forecasting or tracking cognitive decline over time. The next important
steps are determining whether worsening CAT performance precedes the later development of cognitive
deficits in PLWH and which central auditory tests and other variables can predict neurocognitive deficits
accurately. Neurocognitive screening tests are often sensitive to education, literacy, and culture. Full
neurocognitive test batteries can be difficult to employ, particularly in the developing world where clinician time
is limited, few trained personnel are available, and normative data often do not exist. Using CATs would be a
major advance for following HIV+ patients because the CATs can be short (a gap detection test takes 5
minutes), easy to explain (the hearing-in-noise test and triple digit task involve identifying words or numbers in
background noise), or effortless for the subject (the FFR test requires no subject input at all). This project’s
goal is tracking the trajectory of peripheral auditory, central auditory, and neurocognitive performance over time
by continuing to follow this cohort. With these longitudinal data machine learning and other statistical
techniques will be applied to assess which factors forecast the subsequent development of cognitive deficits
and which factors or combination of factors identify those with existing neurocognitive deficits. An international
team with experience in central auditory testing and neurocognitive testing in PLWH has been assembled. Dr.
Nina Kraus and her Northwestern team are internationally recognized experts in the auditory FFR. The Dar es
Salaam team has extensive experience in otolaryngology and performing peripheral auditory, central auditory,
and neurocognitive tests. Drs. Roth and Boivin are experts in assessing neurocognitive function. Dr. Gui has
diverse biostatistical experience. Dr. Niemczak is an expert in peripheral and central auditory processing. This
team and longitudinal cohort offer the unique ability to assess the use of CATs in evaluating cognition as well
as the effects of aging and medications on both central and peripheral auditory function in PLWH."

This application is for a Mentored Career Development Award to Promote Diversity in the Dental, Oral and
Craniofacial Research Workforce (K01). I am testing the hypothesis that combining a dietary antioxidant with
proton radiation will improve outcome in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). This award will provide
me with the resources I need to achieve the following goals: (1) To become a leading expert in proton radiation
as well as novel therapeutic strategies to improve outcome in patients with HNC. (2) To complete the research
and career development activities proposed in this application. (3) To increase the visibility of, to mentor and to
promote inclusion of researchers who are underrepresented or who are from a disadvantaged background in
the field of HNC. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentorship team with
complementary expertise. These include: (1) Dr. Vinita Takiar (primary mentor, radiation oncology and HNC),
(2) Dr. Susan Waltz (co-primary mentor, tumor growth, senior researcher, microenvironment and metastasis),
(3) Dr. Trisha Wise-Draper (committee member, hematology oncology, immunology and HNC), (4) Dr.
Susanne Wells (committee member, senior researcher, organoids, proton and photon radiation, and HNC).
Resistance to therapeutic treatment in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a form of HNC,
significantly contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. As salvage options remain limited, there is a
critical need to develop novel therapeutic approaches to extend survival in patients with HNSCC. Previous
research by the PI and others has demonstrated that the dietary antioxidant isothiocyanate compounds can
sensitize cancer cells to radiation and cytokine. Isothiocyanates also protect normal cells from the effects of
radiation. The long-term goal of this project is to improve patient outcomes by improving treatment response.
The overall objective of this proposal is to test whether isothiocyanate, phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), in
combination with proton radiation, generates increased DNA damage and lethality in HNSCC cells. The central
hypothesis is that the combination of proton radiation with PEITC is superior to the current standard of care
combination, which is cisplatin with photon beam therapy (XRT). To examine the central hypothesis, we
propose the following specific aims: 1) Examine how PEITC enhances proton radiation mediated cell death
and 2) investigate the effects of PEITC in protecting normal head and neck cells from radiation. Developing
alternative treatment strategies to improve radiation response is significant since failed response to radiation
results in decreased patient survival. This research proposal is innovative in that it focuses on utilizing well-
tolerated, dietary antioxidants as an alternative strategy to overcoming radiation resistance in HNSCC and
employs the use of cutting edge proton radiation. This proposal will ultimately provide insight and mechanistic
understanding into developing alternative treatment strategies to overcome radiation treatment resistance in
HNSCC patients as well as potentially other cancer types."

A nucleus-to-mitochondria nucleic acid-sensing pathway prevents bypass of age-associated
proliferative boundaries
Development of immortality as function of age is dependent on the ability of cells to escape from at least two
distinct proliferative barriers, replicative senescence and crisis. Both serve as critical tumor-suppressors, but the
pathways governing them are distinct. Replicative senescence is triggered by short functional telomeres,
dependent on the p53/pRB tumor suppressor pathways and characterized by permanent cell cycle arrest and
continued metabolism. When p53/pRB pathways are dysfunctional, senescence entry is compromised, and cells
continue to proliferate until their telomeres become dysfunctional and chromosome fusions arise. This triggers
replicative crisis, a p53/pRB-independent state, where the vast majority of cells rapidly succumb to cell death.
However, rare cells can even overcome this barrier and become neoplastic, pointing to replicative crisis as one
of the final barriers against age-associated tumor cell initiation. Recently, it was discovered that cell death in
crisis is governed by macroautophagy through a pathway in which cytoplasmic DNA species from fused and
broken chromosomes activate the cGAS-STING cytoplasmic DNA-sensing response that normally detects viral
DNA. Suppression of autophagy allowed cells to bypass crisis and continue to proliferate, while accumulating
genome instability. This discovery represented the first crisis-bypass system, which allowed the design of a
CRISPR suppression screen aimed at identifying factors required to protect cells against age-associated cancer
initiation. Another nucleic acid sensor, ZBP1 emerged as critical for the crisis program, which was confirmed by
ZBP1 suppression allowing cells to proliferate beyond crisis. Here, in three synergistic aims it is proposed to
decipher the mechanism underlying the ZBP1-dependent inhibition of cancer initiation. AIM1 will determine the
interactions between dysfunctional telomeres, telomeric (TERRA) transcripts and ZBP1 and define the
mechanisms of ZBP1-mediated innate immune signaling on mitochondria during crisis. AIM2 is designed to
investigate the mechanism of the mitochondrial localization of the crisis-specific isoform of ZBP1 and its relevant
interacting partners. Finally, the ability to allow cells to proliferate beyond crisis revealed the existence of a third
previously unknown proliferative barrier against cancer initiation (called M3), which will be extensively
characterized in AIM 3. Successful completion of these aims will shed new light on crosstalk between telomeres,
mitochondria and inflammation (three established hallmarks of aging), the role of a telomere-to-mitochondria
innate immune signaling pathway in the prevention of age-associated cancer and establish biomarkers and new
approaches to understand the relevance of the new M3 proliferative barrier as tumor-suppressor."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder associated with chronic
neuroinflammation and the build-up of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. A therapeutic
approach that harnesses neuroinflammation and restores neuronal integrity can potentially be an effective
means to alleviate the progression of neurodegeneration in AD. Here we provide novel findings supporting the
notion that MG53, a tissue repair protein, can potentially slow AD neurodegeneration by protecting neurons from
stress-induced injuries and mitigating neuroinflammation associated with AD. MG53 is a member of the TRIM
protein family that plays an essential role in cell membrane repair. While predominantly expressed in skeletal
muscle, moderate exercise can induce secretion of MG53 into circulation to elicit its tissue protective function.
Transgenic mice with increased levels of MG53 in the bloodstream live a healthy lifespan and are resistant to
stress-induced brain injury. Recombinant human MG53 (rhMG53) protein, administered systemically, can
permeate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to protect against traumatic brain injuries (TBI) in rodents and pigs. MG53
also passes through the BBB of human AD patients as it is detected in cerebrospinal fluid. In addition to
facilitating tissue repair, MG53 has an anti-inflammation function that dampens neuroinflammation associated
with TBI and LPS-neurotoxicity in mice. Pilot studies with AD mice reveal beneficial effects of rhMG53 to
enhance neuronal integrity and reduce neuroinflammation through control of microglia activation. The long-
term goal of this project is to decipher the physiology of MG53 in neuroprotection and to translate the basic
findings into a clinical treatment for AD. We have assembled a team with complementary expertise in
neurophysiology, microglia biology, innovative live-cell imaging, clinical AD research and unique animal models
of AD, with the goal to arrive at a mechanistic understanding of MG53's dual function in control of
neuroinflammation and in preservation of neuronal integrity during AD progression. The experiments designed
in this proposal are focused on addressing the following three fundamental questions: How does MG53
contribute to the maintenance of neural integrity associated with the progression of AD? What are the
mechanisms that underlie MG53's anti-inflammation function in the microglia? Can we target the dual function
of MG53 as a means for alleviation of neurodegeneration associated with the progression of AD?"

Motile cilia play essential roles in fertility, innate immunity, and embryonic development. The beat of motile cilia
is powered by a diverse family of ATP-dependent motors called axonemal dyneins. Axonemal dyneins are
tethered in repeating patterns to doublet microtubules within the ciliary axoneme and are classified by the
number of motor domains (or heads) that they contain and their position within the axoneme. Outer dynein
arms (ODA) are either double or triple-headed complexes that repeat every 24 nm, whereas inner dynein arms
(IDA) are either double or single-headed and repeat every 96 nm. Their different positions, periodicities, and
subunit compositions manifest as different activities: the ODA determines the beat frequency, whereas the IDA
determines the amplitude of the waveform. Despite their fundamental importance to ciliary motility and human
physiology, little is known about the structures and mechanisms of the large axonemal dynein family. In this
proposal, we plan to exploit recent advances in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine
structures of all major classes of axonemal dynein. To capture axonemal dyneins in their active, microtubule-
bound states we have developed methods to isolate and determine high-resolution structures of native dynein-
bound doublet microtubules from three organisms - the biflagellate model organism Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii, Bos taurus and humans. C. reinhardtii will be used for structural, biochemical, and genetic studies
of a triple-headed ODA (Aim 1) and double and single-headed IDAs (Aim 2). These structures are expected to
reveal the mechanisms that dock axonemal dyneins to the doublet microtubule, the structural rearrangements
they undergo during the powerstroke, their regulation by calcium and microtubule curvature, and the functional
relevance of inter-dynein interactions in generating the ciliary waveform. Structures of single and multi-headed
axonemal dyneins will provide insights into the functions of their idiosyncratic subunits and the general
principles that have guided evolution of the axonemal dynein family. Structures of dynein-bound doublet
microtubules from humans and cows (Aim 3) will reveal their differences with algal axonemal dyneins (for
example the comparison between double and triple-headed ODAs) and help explain the etiology of ciliopathy-
causing mutations. Mutations in axonemal dyneins are the leading cause of primary ciliary dyskinesis (PCD), a
currently incurable inherited disease characterized by neonatal respiratory distress, chronic airway infections,
and infertility. Advances in understanding the structures of axonemal dyneins will therefore have important
implications for the identification of key mechanisms that can targeted for therapy of defective cilia."

Dietary restriction (DR) is the most potent method for promoting healthy aging and age-onset disease resistance
in animal models. However, DR’s therapeutic potential is limited by associated negative physiological effects,
including impaired growth, immunity and reproductive capacity. Although nutrientsensing mediators of DR have
been identified, such as mTOR, FOXO/As and the sirtuins, these central nodes recapitulate the entirety of the
response, making them sub-optimal therapeutic targets. Our long-term objective is to uncover molecular
mechanisms that specifically mediate only the pro-longevity effects of DR to develop optimal
therapeutics. A key mediator of DR is AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular fuel gauge activated
when energy levels are low. However, like DR, AMPK increases lifespan at the cost of impaired growth and
reproduction.
The objective in this application is to use the genetically tractable model system C. elegans to identify
mechanisms by which AMPK and DR specifically mediates longevity, in order to elucidate the first molecular
targets that recapitulate only the pro-health effects of DR. The central hypothesis is that beneficial and
detrimental effects of DR can be uncoupled. In support of this hypothesis, specific amino acid combinations in
the diet have recently been shown to increase lifespan while maintaining normal reproduction, establishing that
the positive effects of DR on lifespan do not require obligate detrimental side effects. In addition, in the previous
funding period we demonstrated that the transcriptional coactivator and AMPK direct target CRTC-1 could
uncouple the longevity effects of AMPK from other negative side effects such as developmental delay,
reproduction suppression and reduced body size.
We now seek to identify the mechanisms by which CRTC-1 specifically mediates longevity. The rationale for this
project is that, before we can generate viable therapies from DR for clinical application we must first identify
mechanisms that 1) recapitulate only the positive effects of DR and 2) are effective when applied late in life,
post-diagnosis of age-related disease. Based upon strong preliminary data we will test three specific aims. 1)
We will examine the functional role of neuronal CRTC-1 in promoting healthy aging. 2) We will use CRISPR
editing of endogenous AMPK targets to delineate the roles of additional pathways downstream of this key energy
sensor 3) We will define the contribution of mitochondrial and peroxisome remodeling in AMPK and DR longevity.
Collectively, we expect this work to provide the first example of molecular pathways that uncouple the positive
and negative effects of DR, a critical step in transitioning DR research to the promotion of healthy human aging."

Until recently, N-lysine acetylation was thought to be rare in bacteria, but is now appreciated to affect hundreds of
bacterial proteins with diverse cellular functions. Acetylation was initially discovered as a post-translational modification
(PTM) on the unstructured, highly basic N-terminal tails of eukaryotic histones. Histone acetylation constitutes part of the
“histone code,” and regulates chromosome compaction and various DNA processes, such as gene expression, replication,
repair and recombination. In eukaryotes, acetylation regulates many other proteins in addition to histones, involved in a
wide array of important biological processes. This observation is also true in bacteria, as evidenced by the characterization
of the acetylomes of more than 30 different bacterial species. However, the physiological significance of the vast majority
of these modifications remains unknown. In addition, the mechanisms of acetylation and deacetylation, and the
bacterial enzymes involved are not completely understood. To address these gaps in knowledge, we have focused on
studying the acetylation of the essential, histone-like protein HBsu in Bacillus subtilis. In bacteria, the nucleoid is
compacted and organized by the action of nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs). HBsu is a member of the most widely
conserved NAP family, and is considered a functional equivalent of eukaryotic histones. We found that HBsu contains
seven novel acetylation sites, and this raised the exciting possibility that these modifications represent a “histone-like”
code in bacteria. So far, we discovered that acetylation of HBsu at key lysine residues is required to maintain normal
chromosome compaction. Additionally, we identified the second protein acetyltransferase in B. subtilis. The overall goal
of our research program is to decipher this code. Our recent progress supports the hypotheses that acetylation of HBsu
regulates cell division and sporulation, and that there are additional enzymes involved in regulating acetylation. The short-
term goals of this work are to define the enzymatic mechanism of regulation of HBsu acetylation and determine the
significance of HBsu acetylation in the regulation of DNA transactions, stationary phase development and drug tolerance.
Additionally, we will develop new biochemical and mass-spectrometry based proteomics techniques for the study of
acetylation in bacteria. Our long-term goals are to characterize additional HBsu PTMs, identify and characterize novel
enzymes of acetylation, and perform a detailed structural and biochemical analysis with acetylated HBsu and novel
enzymes. Ultimately, we will design novel inhibitors of bacterial acetylation enzymes or acetylated HBsu and assess their
efficacy as potential novel antimicrobial therapies. Together, these studies may demonstrate the existence of a histone-
like code in bacteria, an unexpected and exciting new field of biology. Furthermore, these studies will provide the
foundation for designing novel antimicrobial drugs that target protein acetylation, either the enzymes or key acetylated
targets."

No single gene exists in isolation, rather the genes in the genome make up an intricate network of interacting
components that come together in different pathways and processes to generate a phenotype. Even small
genetic changes can have far reaching consequences for an organism’s phenotype, let alone when large
numbers of genes are different between strains, which is the case for those species with a pan-genome. For
instance, a strain of the bacterial pathogen S. pneumoniae on average contains ~2100 genes, while the entire
species harbors >4400 genes, which means that two random strains may differ by the presence and absence of
hundreds of different genes. Within a biological network, many genes are dispensable, which within a pan-
genome are mostly those genes that are variably present. In contrast, about 10-15% of genes in a bacterial
genome are essential and keep an organism’s functionality intact under any circumstance. Due to their acute
importance, essential genes are generally seen as rigid and largely immutable, consequently making them
excellent targets for, for instance, antimicrobial therapies. However, by computationally interrogating thousands
of S. pneumoniae strains, and 17 clinical strains experimentally, we have created a large dataset that shows that
not all essential genes are ‘created equal’. Specifically, essential genes do not always seem to be present in all
strains, and depending on a strain’s background, can sometimes be experimentally deleted. This raises the
hypothesis that the essential gene concept is much more fluid than assumed and indicates that, under the right
circumstances (i.e., genetic background), essential genes are evolvable and can switch to non-essential. In this
proposal we aim to understand why some genes are essential, while others are not, we experimentally explore
how essentiality can evolve, whether it is predictable, what the possible functional, phenotypic and/or
evolutionary consequences are, and how we can take advantage of evolvable essentiality. Specifically, In Aim
1.1 several genomics tools are used to comprehensively map out evolvable essential genes in S. pneumoniae
by sampling >85% of the genetic diversity in the pan-genome. In Aim 1.2 the evolvability of ~200 genes is
explored with three validated strategies that reflect and uncover the ease in which an essential gene can become
non-essential. And in Aim 1.3 we use machine learning to determine whether essential gene evolvability is
predictable. In Aim 2.1 45 (evolvable) essential genes in cell wall synthesis and associated pathways are
interrogated with CRISPRi-TnSeq to build a detailed interaction network. In Aim 2.2 we engineer paired-strains,
where in one strain a gene is essential, and a near identical strain it is not. And in Aim 2.3 we use the paired-
strains and employ different approaches to assign gene function and identify mechanistic consequences of
evolvable essentials. In Aim 3.1 the paired-strains are used to determine whether there are fitness costs
associated with evolvable essentials, while in Aim 3.2 we determine whether there is a cost to adaptability,
thereby potentially creating a trade-off. Finally, in Aim 3.3 we exploit the pan-genome and our new strain-pairs
in an attempt to design a novel proof-of principle gene-targeting drug screen."

(i.e., microglia and white matter tracts) and neurocognition in alcohol use disorder (AUD) to identify novel
treatment targets that address sex differences. The research component of this 5-year plan involves the
application of: (1) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to examine sex differences in neurocognitive
function that underlie sex differences in microglia levels in AUD; (2) diffusion tensor magnetic resonance
imaging (DTI) to examine sex differences in white matter tract integrity in AUD and; (3) PET and DTI
multimodal integration analysis to determine the relationship between microglia levels, white matter tract

with AUD and 30 age-, sex-, and smoking-matched healthy controls will participate in both PET and DTI
scanning to facilitate PET, DTI, and PET/DTI integration analysis. To systematically identify sex differences in
patterns of white matter tract integrity, the candidate will also examine data from a large, archived,
neuroimaging DTI dataset (The Human Connectome Project), to generate publications and productivity during
data collection. This combination of novel data collection and secondary data analyses is designed to
maximize the candidate's training via provision of hands-on experience in both: (1) the theory and conduct of
her own combined multimodal neuroimaging study under guided supervision of recognized experts; and, (2)
the analysis and interpretation of large-scale neuroimaging datasets. In pursuit of these goals, the candidate
proposes to undertake further training in four primary areas: (1) the neurobiology of AUD, (2) treatment
outcomes research and clinical corelates of AUD, (3) DTI and multimodal neuroimaging, and (4) biostatistical
approaches. The opportunities afforded by the K01 mechanism would enable the candidate to embark on a
rigorous, structured 5-year program of training and research, designed to provide her with the necessary skills
in the four areas highlighted above. This program of study will combine formal didactic courses, directed
readings, one-on-one tutorials, specialized workshops, attendance of scientific research conferences, and
mentored research experience. The research and training proposed in this K01 provides an ideal
interdisciplinary opportunity to achieve the candidate's long-term career goal of becoming an independent

 It is well documented that the ability of the brain to undergo plasticity becomes limited in adults. In
particular, sensory experience-dependent plasticity of cortical circuits is rather confined to a limited time during
development, termed the critical period. Recovery and refinement of sensory processing is therefore difficult in
adults. For example, the success rate of speech recognition in artificial cochlear implant patients becomes
quite low, if the surgery is done later in life. Hence discovery of mechanisms that can recover adult cortical
plasticity is of essence to benefit recovery of hearing or for treating abnormal auditory processing as occurs
with tinnitus. We found that temporary visual deprivation is quite effective at producing large-scale plasticity in
the adult primary auditory cortex (A1) of mice. Such changes occurred as potentiation of feedforward excitatory
synapses from the primary auditory thalamus (MGBv) to layer 4 (L4) as well as L4 to L2/3. This was
accompanied by weakening of synapses arising from lateral intracortical sources to L2/3 of A1. In parallel, we
also observed refinement of cortical circuits of A1 L4 and L2/3. Collectively, these changes suggest that A1
circuit adapts to allow better processing of bottom-up auditory inputs, which is consistent with our published
observation of refinement of A1 L4 neuronal receptive field and lowering of detection threshold in visually
deprived mice. In this application, we aim to determine the mechanisms involved in driving adult A1 plasticity
with visual deprivation, and whether visual deprivation improves auditory behavior in adults. Based on our
observation that visual deprivation induced potentiation of thalamocortical (TC) inputs to A1 L4 requires
audition, but no due to changes in the auditory environment, we surmise that there is central adaptation in
circuits mediating auditory signals going through the thalamus and the cortex. In particular, we hypothesize
that short-term visual deprivation promotes A1 plasticity in adults by regulating inhibitory circuits at the level of
thalamus and cortex (Aim 1). The circuit and synaptic adaptation seen in A1 following vision loss accompanied
refinement of A1 L4 neural function, and is predicted to enhance auditory function. We will examine how short-
term visual deprivation alters auditory behavioral tasks in adults, and investigate whether this is due to
changes in A1 neuronal responses and population encoding during auditory tasks using in vivo 2-photon
imaging (Aim 2). Results from our proposed study will provide mechanistic understanding on how short-term
visual deprivation enables plasticity of adult A1 via regulation of thalamic and cortical circuits, and will provide
means to enhance auditory processing in the adult brain that could benefit development of treatment options
for enhancing or recovering auditory function as would be needed for better prognosis of artificial cochlear
implants. Furthermore, our results can be generalized to provide insights into how cortical circuits adapt to
losing major inputs as it may happen during injury, stroke, and neuronal degeneration."

Psychiatric symptoms are a leading cause of suffering and disability worldwide. Decades of research have focused on
understanding their etiology and underpinnings, typically using a diagnosis-based approach in which individuals with a
given condition are compared to a matched ‘control’ group. Less work has focused on characterizing the longitudinal
course of symptoms at the individual level in relation to underlying cognitive, affective, and behavioral mechanisms.
Recognizing that most (if not all) psychiatric disorders are defined by their longitudinal course, this application moves
beyond the limitations of traditional diagnosis-centered and ‘case-control’ designs to collect longitudinal data over two
years from a large sample (N=2400), highly enriched for psychopathology across a wide range of traditional diagnoses,
to identify predictive markers of symptom change using assessments that can be easily implemented in real-world
settings. Specifically, we will collect: (i) data embedded in electronic health records (EHR), including social determinants
of health; (ii) traditional clinical measures typically used in diagnosis-based approaches (e.g., clinical interviews, well-
validated clinical scales); (iii) recently developed computational behavioral tasks with demonstrated sensitivity to latent
constructs and to within-person change; (iv) short gamified behavioral measures of mood and reward-relevant
constructs, measured repeatedly; (v) spoken narrative responses to uniform prompts for natural language processing
(NLP) analyses; and (vi) patient-derived and NIH Toolbox continuous measures of key transdiagnostic outcomes. These
data will be analyzed using advanced statistical and machine learning approaches (e.g., latent growth curve modeling,
neural network transformer modeling), consistent with the recommendations set forth in the IMPACT-MH RFA.
In AIM 1, we will use this rich dataset to test the predictive value of ‘traditional’ (EHR, other clinical) vs computational
and NLP data in predicting outcomes. We will further test the differential predictive value of combinations of measures,
including sparse and dense behavioral sampling, seeking to identify a minimum set of measures with maximum added
clinical value. In AIM 2, we will examine longitudinal clinical trajectories using data-driven trajectory analysis of
multidimensional clinical and computational fingerprints; this approach may ultimately be used to generate normative
models to track and forecast clinical course in patients. Finally, in AIM 3, we will seek to identify subgroups, based on
computational fingerprint similarities at baseline, that predict differences in outcomes at 2-year follow-up, and to test
whether optimal predictive models differ among such subgroups.
This rich dataset will have enormous value beyond these three Aims. We are recruiting from established diagnosis- and
population-specific research programs; combination of the longitudinal data collected here with additional data
collected by these programs, including neuroimaging and genetics, will create rich opportunities for secondary and
exploratory analyses in subgroups. Finally, these data will be made available to the community, in deidentified form in
collaboration with the IMPACT-MH Data Coordinating Center, for exploratory and confirmatory analysis by others."

are resolved. Major side effects include cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, accelerated CAR
proliferation, and generation of replication capable lentivirus. As well as infections related to CD4-deplete
host. Strict prophylaxis and monitoring for early treatment for all of those will be implemented. Study
subjects will be monitored closely during and after discharge from hospital with physical exams, lab work,
CAR T persistence testing and end organ toxicity. Description of objective responses will be recorded. This

The New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH), Occupational Health Surveillance (OHS) Unit
proposes to conduct population-based surveillance of established occupational health
indicators (OHIs) in order to estimate and characterize the burden of specific work-related
injuries and illnesses and compare rates to national estimates and evaluate trends over time.
We propose to enhance and evaluate our surveillance system to expand data collection,
prevention, and intervention activities in NJ. OHS will continue to conduct surveillance of adult
blood lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium. NJ has regulatory authority to collect occupational
health surveillance data for all occupational diseases and injuries. The specific Aims of the
project are as follows:
1. Maintain and analyze data collected for 23 specified occupational health indicators (OHI)
 and conduct an education and outreach effort focused on reducing exposure to asbestos.
2. Analyze specified OHIs to characterize occupational health injuries and illnesses among
 vulnerable populations to formulate strategies for interventions. This includes a specific
 project focused on youth injuries and a general focus on vulnerable worker populations,
 such essential critical infrastructure workers.
3. Maintain data collection of adult blood lead and other heavy metals. Conduct surveillance
 of exposed individuals to identify at-risk workplaces for further targeted interventions, such
 as education and outreach and referral to regulatory authorities.
The NJDOH OHS Unit proposes two Fundamental Plus projects to enhance our
occupational health surveillance by utilizing and evaluating new data sources and
translating real-time data to public health action. OHS will also develop a framework for
occupational health surveillance of emergent infectious diseases by including workplace
variables in non-traditional datasets, which aims to improve surveillance and mitigate
workplace transmission of COVID-19 in the current pandemic. OHS Unit Staff will conduct
trainings for the collection of industry and occupation information in these nontraditional
surveillance systems, including communicable diseases, contact tracing, and poison
control inquiries. The specific Aims of the Fundamental Plus projects are the following:
1. Promote inclusion and analysis of occupation and industry variables in nontraditional
 data sources, through existing and new partnerships to enhance surveillance of
 emergent diseases and hazards.
2. Enhance the EpiCenter syndromic surveillance system as a real-time surveillance
 system for work-related nonfatal injuries and poisonings.
Establishing and evaluating key findings from these new data sources will position the NJ
state-based surveillance project to strengthen our capacity to conduct surveillance and
build partnerships to protect worker health and safety. This project will cultivate existing
relationships with Rutgers University, our regional NIOSH Education and Research Center,
the NJ Poison Control Center, and other key partners within NJDOH, including the Public
Employee Occupational Safety and Health program and the Communicable Disease
Service. Continued collaboration with current partners, as well as potential new partners
and stakeholders, will improve our future response efforts to work-related injuries and
poisonings in the State."

As with many other diseases, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder consisting of multiple
pathologies that are each known to be deleterious in their own right. Clinical trials assessing disease-modifying
drugs for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have largely been focused on amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology rather than other
pathological components including tau pathology and gliosis. This is in part due to Aβ pathology being viewed
as the initiating event responsible for all other pathologies. The interim result is Aducanumab (AduhelmTM;
Biogen) recently approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)l, likely to be effective at early stages of AD
where it would be most effective in halting downstream pathologies. Treatments for later stages of diseases will
require therapeutics not only for Aβ, but also tau pathology and gliosis namely combination therapy (CT). CT
has recently been strongly encouraged by the European Union-North American Clinical Trials in Alzheimer’s
disease Task Force (EU/US CTAD Task Force) and the FDA5. Aducanumab on its own is already dose-limited
due to its potential for off-target toxicity and development of a CT including its use would result in additive toxicity
that the other drugs may introduce plus possible unknown drug interactions. This makes CT extremely complex
to research and to date unattractive for big pharma. To overcome these challenges, we have designed a smart
cell-based drug delivery (SmACD) system to enable in vitro research highly translatable to in vivo validation that
has the capability of support a large number of drugs currently being used in clinical trials and to deliver them in
combination to the brain without the toxicity associated with systemic or other forms of bulk drug administration.
We propose to use SmaCD to target the most afflicted brain regions in AD equipped with a CT based on
Aducanumab and Zagotenemab to elicit microglia-mediated clearance of neurotoxic oligomeric Aβ and disease-
spreading tau, respectively, accompanied by an immunomodulator to enhance the phagocytic activity of
microglia whilst suppressing inflammation. We plan to test the technology initially in human cells and mouse cells
followed by in vivo validation in a transgenic mouse model of AD that presents Aβ and tau pathology
accompanied by gliosis at mid and late stages of disease development. Our results, if successful, would directly
provide ‘proof-of-concept’ for the translatability of SmaCD-delivered CT drug therapy for use in the intervention
of human disease."

10874495,"Project 1 Abstract
The comprehensive assessment of hazardous substances in complex environmental samples is essential in
understanding the “environmental exposome” and identifying potential human health and environmental risks.
Although targeted analyses are commonly used to measure between 10 and 100 specific substances per study,
their precise parameters and limited coverage are not suitable for evaluating other potentially hazardous
substances that may be present in the samples. This limitation has showcased the importance of untargeted
measurements as hundreds of new chemicals are being introduced annually that need to be assessed. Since
untargeted analyses can focus on all detected features, they are able to evaluate those with statistical
significance between sample type and location, in addition to features with extremely high abundance. The
information from the untargeted studies therefore provides the evaluation of novel and legacy hazardous
substances in addition to their metabolites, intermediates and degradants which can be more hazardous than
the parent compounds. However, untargeted measurements are greatly challenged by how to optimize
instruments for broad characterization and then how to analyze all of the “big” data that are generated by the
new analytical methods. Thus, both analytical and computational developments are necessary. By combining
ion mobility spectrometry (IMS)-derived structural information, mass spectrometry (MS)-derived high-resolution
m/z measurements and new data processing algorithms, we aim to create a uniform workflow for evaluation of
complex environmental mixtures in the untargeted studies of samples obtained before, during and after
environmental emergencies. To enable comprehensive analytical characterization, we will couple the
multidimensional IMS-MS analyses with steps including sample concentration, extraction and liquid
chromatography (LC) separations to allow an in-depth characterization of the mixtures. The information obtained
from the untargeted IMS-MS and LC-IMS-MS studies will include molecular properties such as m/z, Kendrick
Mass Defect (KMD), retention time (RT) and collision cross section (CCS). As these values have shown utility in
targeted studies for molecular classification, they will be combined with our targeted library of >3,000
environmental chemicals from the past funding period and processed with cheminformatics and machine
learning algorithms to annotate and classify the unknown features from the untargeted studies. We will also
utilize both the targeted and untargeted studies to enable better disaster-related evaluation of potential chemical
exposures by creating a list containing thousands of hazardous substances for rapid characterization with
automated solid phase sample cleanup and IMS-MS. This automated SPE-IMS-MS platform will provide 10 s
sample-to-sample throughput and when coupled with cloud-based data assessment, it will enable the rapid
chemical analyses of complex environmental samples from disaster situations that may involve chemical spills."
10874498,"Project 2 ABSTRACT
Project 2 is a new Biomedical Research Project aimed at developing novel tools to rapidly characterize pediatric
respiratory health risks from exposure to hazardous volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This work will be a
critical element in the overall strategy of the Texas A&M University Superfund Research Center to characterize
and manage the human health risks associated with exposure to environmental emergency-mobilized hazardous
substances. Current toxicity testing strategies do not account for developmental stage that is representative of
the pediatric lung or encompass human population variability, even though these factors (i.e., age, sex, race,
and genetics) are critical in asthma risk. Moreover, mechanisms of action underlying individual/combined VOCs
on asthma pathogenesis is poorly understood. To support the evaluation of hazardous VOCs, including real
urban mixtures, and elucidate mechanistic linkages, Project 2 will test the hypothesis that the pediatric airway is
distinctly susceptible to pulmonary injury from hazardous VOCs, and that airway responses are modulated by
extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated signaling. The research team brings together a toxicologist, a physician-
scientist and an atmospheric chemist to address the following specific aims. Aim 1 prioritizes the evaluation of
20 individual Superfund-priority VOCs to test for asthma-related phenotypes in vitro, first using a respiratory
epithelial cell line (16HBE) cultured at air-liquid interface, and then in a population-based, age-appropriate model
comprised of pediatric bronchial epithelial cells from the Developing Lung Molecular Atlas Program. Next,
representative designed mixtures matching environmentally-relevant proportions of chemicals in ambient air will
be evaluated in the standard and population-based pediatric cell lines. These responses will inform aim 2
mechanistic studies, which will test the hypothesis that VOC exposures alter EV protein expression, underlying
respiratory dysfunction. It is known that inflammation and epithelial barrier function are mediated by exosomes,
a class of secreted EVs ranging from 30 to 150 nm. In aim 2, EVs derived from 16HBE cells exposed to select
VOCs/mixtures will be purified and sequenced using a high-throughput proteomics approach. Protein signatures
revealed in this model will then be validated across diverse pediatric donor cell lines. Last, the functional role of
VOC-exposed, cell-derived EVs will be evaluated using adoptive transfer experiments. In parallel to aims 1 and
2, aim 3 objectives will characterize VOC mixtures through mobile air monitoring across different locations in the
greater Houston Area during baseline and in response to environmental disasters. Additionally, to fill in gaps in
disaster-related toxicity testing, 16HBE cells will be directly exposed to ambient air onboard the mobile platform
in the field, using time-resolved measurements to drive conditional sampling of different air masses. Outcomes
from the studies proposed in Project 2 are highly relevant to the Superfund Program. Overall, the novel tools and
findings will improve basic understanding of mechanisms underlying VOC-induced pediatric pulmonary injury
and enable improved risk assessment to rapidly characterize respiratory hazards that threaten children’s health."
10874500,"Project 3 Abstract
Exposures to environmental hazardous substances, including those in the event of natural and anthropogenic
disasters, are known to negatively impact pregnancy, leading to adverse outcomes such as preterm birth (PTB).
However, establishing a clear link between exposure and pregnancy risk is challenging, due to lack of a
mechanistic knowledge by which toxicants activate pathways causing PTB in maternal-fetal tissues.
Unfortunately, current in vitro and in vivo toxicity testing models are either not sufficient in assessing the hazards
of tested substances on pregnancy outcomes, do not represent the human in utero structure and functions
accurately, or are too costly and low throughput. In addition, assessment of the hazards imposed by exposures
to complex environmental samples that may contain multiple hazardous chemicals, often observed after
disasters, is even more challenging. Here, we propose to develop a feto-maternal (F-M) interface tissue chip-
based testing strategy for assessing the human health hazard of environmental substances on PTB. Our central
hypothesis is that a tissue chip model that mimics the physiology of the complex multi-cellular F-M interface will
enable evaluation of the mechanistic pathophysiologic pathways affected by exposure to complex environmental
hazardous substances that may increase the risk of PTB. These tissue chip models mimic the fetal and maternal
uterine tissues structurally and functionally, and will be used to evaluate mechanistic pathophysiologic pathways
in the F-M interface imposed by complex mixed environmental hazardous substances. This will be accomplished
through the following three aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a mechanistic model of PTB in response to
environmental toxicants using a fetal membrane tissue chip model. In Aim 2, we will develop a mechanistic
model of PTB in response to environmental toxicants using a placenta tissue chip model. In Aim 3, which will
focus on the application of our novel models for Disaster Research Response (DR2), we will demonstrate rapid
assessment of the potential human health hazards of environmental exposures on disrupting F-M homeostasis
that can lead to PTB by using a higher-throughput F-M tissue chip model. The success of this proposed research
will provide critical and timely information for hazard assessment on toxicants’ impact on PTB using tissue chip
models, especially related to toxicants from existing Superfund sites and from emergency disaster-related
contaminants. Thematically, this project is well integrated into the Texas A&M University Superfund Research
Center that is focusing on addressing the human health risks of exposure to hazardous substances during and
after emergencies, especially the effects on particularly vulnerable populations (pregnant women and children)."
10874502,"Project 4 ABSTRACT
Project 4 aims to develop a translational in vitro-to-in vivo testing strategy for evaluating the inter-tissue and inter-
individual variability in responses to complex environmental exposures. This goal is a critical part of the overall
strategy of the Texas A&M University Superfund Research Center to characterize and manage the human health
risks associated with exposure to environmental emergency-mobilized hazardous substances through the
development of tools that can be used by first responders, the impacted communities, and the government
bodies involved in site management and cleanup. In the past funding period, we not only developed a multi-
tissue “biological read-across” approach for complex environmental exposures in high-content/high-throughput
assays using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), but also demonstrated its utility for quantitative
estimation of hazard of complex environmental exposures through a number of case studies that spanned
community, national and international scales. These studies show how new approach methodologies (NAMs)
can be applied for assessment of risks from real-life exposures. Our central hypothesis remains that a tiered
risk-based strategy for safety evaluation utilizing human organotypic in vitro cultures, combined with population-
based reverse toxicokinetics, can be used to accurately characterize the risks posed by combined exposures to
hazardous substances during environmental emergencies. First, we will develop a population-based human in
vitro approach to characterize inter-tissue and inter-individual variability in responses to complex environmental
exposures. We will test the hypothesis that human population-based in vitro models can refine hazard predictions
and characterize the molecular underpinnings and extent of inter-tissue and inter-individual variability. Second,
we will develop a high-throughput reverse toxicokinetics (RTK) modeling approach for complex exposures to
enable in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) of environmental samples. Because IVIVE is critical for
interpretation of in vitro NAMs data in the context of human health, we hypothesize that novel exposomic
analyses and new organ-on-a-chip models can provide concentration- and combined exposure-dependent RTK
parameters needed for IVIVE, ultimately enabling more accurate predictions of effects in vivo. Third, as art of
Center’s Disaster Research Response (DR2) approach, we will demonstrate the application of human multi-
tissue and population-wide high-throughput in vitro models to disaster research response. We will show how the
“biological read-across” method developed in the past funding period can be applied to DR2 by testing the
hypothesis that in vitro toxicity data can be used to quantitatively predict and characterize health hazard of
environmental samples. We will partner with all Projects to use their samples or collaborate on analytical,
molecular and biomedical engineering methods and techniques. We will work with all Cores for data analysis
and management, geospatial analysis, and translation of our research to the impacted communities and other
stakeholders. The data and methods from this project will be of critical importance in responses to disasters."

Technological advancements have yielded novel drug targets and improved cancer detection,
but transformative innovations in treatment modalities are lacking. Leveraging our team's
expertise in gene therapy, breast cancer, cancer immunology, and breast cancer animal and
patient-derived xenograft models, we propose to use recombinant adenovirus with a higher
tumor-specific expression of herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK), which is a
suicide gene that causes tumor cell death. We will combine HSV-TK with our immune
checkpoint antibody (i.e. HMR-101) that will specifically target tumor cells, release tumor
antigens and change the tumor microenvironment to be more favorable for immune therapy.
The immunotherapy we are developing will modify cancer-promoting immune cells to become
anti-cancer immune cells. Therefore, an army of anti-cancer immune cells trained to recognize
cancerous cells will mobilize and circulate around the body to destroy metastases. Given the
predominance of tumor-associated immunosuppressive myeloid cells in triple-negative breast
cancer, local delivery of HMR-101 could effectively reprogram the tumor microenvironment to
an anti-tumor immune phenotype. The viral transduction efficiency of our viral vector is very
high at the tumor site with chimeric viral vector (low neutralization antibody), and it will be low
spreading to other organs. This viral vector is safe and approved by the FDA and at low cost
for human use. As such, our intratumoral strategy would allow for maximizing the full potency
of the immunotherapeutic antibody, thus enhancing therapeutic index. We envision this
technology to move forward to clinical trials, strongly supported by the success of our recently
completed STOMP trial for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer or TNBC (NCT03004183,
HSV-TK, radiation, and immune checkpoint therapy on metastatic TNBC). Clinically, we
envision that our intratumor gene delivery of HMR-101 will reprogram the immune system,
prevent patients from relapse, and prolong anti-tumor immunity, thus benefiting patients
receiving immunotherapy. For triple-negative breast cancer patients who typically have dismal
clinical response due to high metastatic rate and recurrence, the potential clinical impact of
our intratumoral viral delivery containing novel immune checkpoint antibody is profound.
Overall, the therapeutic reach of our novel therapeutic regimen is expansive, offering a truly
transformative approach to cancer treatment."

The long-term goal of this project is to define mechanisms that regulate Okazaki fragment maturation (OFM) and
determine how functional alterations in OFM enzymes and/or regulatory mechanisms cause genome instability
and cancer. It is known that OFM processes are implemented via the scaffold protein PCNA, which mediates
the sequential actions of Pol , flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), and DNA ligase 1 (LIG1), in the DNA replication
machinery. However, there are important knowledge gaps regarding the specific regulatory mechanisms that
ensure the various OFM enzymes act sequentially to minimize mutagenesis and to control cell death.
Unanswered questions include: How is Pol -mediated displacement DNA synthesis (SDDS) regulated by
PARP1 to produce proper RNA-DNA 5' flap substrates for the nuclease FEN1? How are the sequential
posttranslational modifications of FEN1 including arginine demethylation implemented to ensure its exit from the
“work site” in late S phase? How are FEN1 and LIG1 properly exchanged onto the PCNA platform to ensure
orderly OF access and suppression of an alternative, error-prone ligation process? In our preliminary studies,
we have revealed mechanistic insights underlying OFM: i) PARP1 localizes to replication forks at early/middle
but not late S phase, controlling SDDS by Pol. Its inhibition causes accumulation of 5' flaps in cells. ii) FEN1
arginine demethylation allows its dissociation from PCNA. JMJD1B is the arginine demethylase that mediates
FEN1 arginine demethylation. JMJD1B localization to replication sites depends on histone chaperone FACT. iii)
FEN1 and LIG1 sequentially co-localize with PCNA, allowing their orderly access to DNA substrates. iv) FEN1
S187A mutation or JMJD1B deletion similarly leads to PARP1 accumulation, histone PARylation, and LIG3
recruitment, similar to LIG1 knockdown cells. PARP1 inhibition is synthetically lethal with LIG1 knockdown.
Based on these findings, we hypothesize that PARP1-regulated SDDS by Pol, FACT-mediated JMJD1B
recruitment to demethylate FEN1 for its proper drop-off, and PCNA-coordinated FEN1 and LIG1 sequential
access to OFs are crucial regulatory mechanisms for efficient and accurate OFM processes. Therefore, human
cells with gene mutations and/or under stress conditions that disrupt these regulatory mechanisms will induce
alternative, potentially faulty OFM processes for survival, leading to genome instabilities, cancer predisposition,
and development of resistance to cancer therapy. To elucidate these regulatory mechanisms, we aim to i)
determine the roles of PARP1 in controlling Pol -mediated SDDS to ensure proper formation of short 5' flaps
for FEN1 cleavage; ii) determine how FACT-mediated arginine demethylase JMJD1B recruitment regulates
FEN1 dynamics at replication forks; and iii) define the mechanism by which PCNA coordinates orderly access
of FEN1 and LIG1 to OFs and suppresses an alternative, LIG3-mediated OF ligation process.

Individuals with childhood onset, genetically determined neuromuscular disorders (NMD) experience progressive
neuromuscular degeneration resulting in weakness that affects ambulatory function. Genetic testing and
consensus-derived diagnosis guidelines have led to an increasing prevalence of neuromuscular diseases
approaching other more common neurological conditions. Recent therapeutic approaches in Duchenne
muscular dystrophy (DMD) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) have resulted in disease modifying therapies
commercially available or in clinical trials with the best outcomes with early treatment. While results from novel
drug therapies are promising, symptoms of weakness and impaired function persists. Patients report changes in
motor function in real-world settings, but these changes often elude standard in-clinic examinations. There is a
compelling need to develop more sensitive, quantitative assessments that focus on ambulatory function in real-
life settings. Digital mobility outcomes (DMOs) use wearable technology for continuous remote monitoring in a
person’s own environment.
Consumer-grade activity trackers monitor healthy and clinical cohorts, but with limited accuracy. Research grade
trackers and foot-worn gait monitoring devices measure mobility-related volume (step count, distance, duration
of walking bouts, etc.), but can only capture a minimal set of stride-by-stride real-life gait parameters (e.g., stride
time, length, velocity) and they cannot measure kinetic parameters. We argue that the modest accuracy and
granularity of current wearable devices hamper the objective characterization of subtle but clinically meaningful
changes. Our recent findings suggest that novel machine-learning (ML)-based abstraction models may map
noisy signals from foot-worn sensors (namely, instrumented insoles developed by the project team) into accurate
and clinically relevant spatiotemporal and kinetic gait parameters. These gait parameters derived from
instrumented insoles, which we refer to as digital mobility outcomes (DMOs), may serve as functional biomarkers
to detect changes in real world function. The purpose of this research is twofold: (1) to identify disease-specific
walking-related digital biomarkers of disease severity, and (2) to determine the insole-derived DMOs that are
most sensitive to longitudinal changes in ambulatory function and best able to predict 12-month changes in
ambulatory function in DMD and SMA."

In the last five years, we discovered a functional role for glycolytic metabolism in HFSC
homeostasis. We found that lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) activity is essential for HFSC activation,
and that elevation of Ldh activity through blockade of pyruvate entry into mitochondria can
promote HFSC activation. Left unknown from this work is why and how, specifically, HFSCs’
activation is subject to regulation by Ldh activity and/or pyruvate oxidation in the mitochondria.
HFSCs are essential for new hair growth, contribute to wound healing, and are cancer cells of
origin for squamous cell carcinoma. Therefore, understanding how metabolism can regulate cell
fate in HFSCs has important implications. We have several hypotheses to explain how Ldh activity
and/or mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation leads to HFSC activation. First, we have found that Ldh
inhibition in tumors promotes glutamine anapleurosis, and it has been argued that glutaminolysis
is important for HFSC maintenance, so perhaps elevated glutaminolysis prevents HFSC
activation in Ldh-null stem cells. Second, lactate has been shown to act as a signaling molecule,
sometimes referred to as a lactormone. Third, it is possible that instead of lactate, an alternate
product of Ldh activity, L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L2HG), is the key metabolite promoting HFSC
activation; L2HG can impact the activity of a diverse class of enzymes, some of which modulate
epigenetic state and gene expression. Fourth, we have evidence to suggest that these same
regulatory mechanisms are affecting the decision of HFSCs to initiate and drive tumorigenesis,
so we will explore these hypotheses in an established cancer paradigm for squamous cell
carcinoma."

During fetal skin development, over thirty distinct cell types emerge to form a solid barrier capable of immune
surveillance and sensory detection. Due to its complexity, the skin has been challenging to reproduce in
cultures. Maintenance of excised skin has only been possible for short durations. Yet, a longer-term skin
culture system could greatly benefit efforts to model congenital diseases, investigate the mechanisms of
cancer initiation, or mimic the site of infection, inflammation, and wounds. A critical obstacle to progress has
been our inability to identify culture conditions that satisfy the metabolic needs of cells found in every skin
subdomain, including skin appendages, such as hair follicles and sweat glands, and accessory structures,
such as vasculature and nerves. Incorporating diverse immune cell populations has evaded previous
engineering attempts. Recently, we invented a novel culture system that uses human pluripotent cells (hPSCs)
to generate full-thickness skin with many of the cellular components of normal skin, including epidermis,
dermis, hair follicles, and sensory nerves—collectively known as skin organoids. Although an improvement
over previous skin models in terms of completeness, the resulting skin arises as a massive floating tissue that
is challenging to monitor over time in culture and is devoid of immune cells. Here, we will build on preliminary
data showing that skin organoids can reformat onto easily imaged microfluidic chips that we have maintained
for over 100 days without apparent tissue degradation. For Goal 1, we will optimize a manufacturing process
for creating hair-bearing skin organoids-on-a-chip by iteratively evaluating chip geometry, matrix composition,
mechanical properties, and chemical treatments supplied to the developing tissue. We will use quantitative
imaging and single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to assess the quality of our chip designs. For Goal 2, we will
evaluate a novel chip design that better integrates neuro-vascular structures into the skin organoid chips. For
Goal 3, we will build on exciting preliminary data to integrate myeloid and lymphoid lineage cells into
developing skin organoid chips. We will define the proper timing and medium requirements for immune cell
seeding and assess the fidelity of immuno-competent skin organoid chips through direct comparison to fetal
histological specimens. We will test the system by simulating immune reactions due to hPSC donor
incompatibility and bacterial infection. These experiments will yield chips with stereotyped neural inputs and
vascular networks. Our collaborative team has strong bioengineering, material science, neuroscience, and
immunology expertise and is uniquely suited to execute the project goals. Our research strategy considers how
others could adopt our methodology, and we include plans for beta-testing tissue chip production in less
equipped laboratories. We anticipate that our skin organoid tissue chips will provide researchers with a
powerful new tool to watch and learn as human skin develops under normal and diseased conditions."

Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections and schistosomiasis affect 2 billion people and have significant
detrimental effects on health. Strategies to implement STH and schistosomiasis interventions currently rely on
testing for these parasites by microscopic analysis of stool samples to detect parasite eggs and identify egg
species. Accurate surveillance testing and timely and accurate reporting of results are required for effective
decision-making at the programmatic level to implement infection control strategies. Approaches that increase
the speed and standardize the accuracy of microscopy-based testing and streamline reporting could help
eliminate STH infections and schistosomiasis.
We propose to develop a mobile phone-based STH-schistosome egg identification and counting tool that
employs machine learning (deep learning) and works in the absence of an internet connection. With this app,
users will collect surveillance data for integration into a cloud platform. Surveillance data can then be visualized
in dashboards to inform interventions to control disease.
Our approach is fundamentally different from other published work that develop machine learning algorithms
for STH and schistosomiasis because it will very accurately identify egg types during surveillance activities,
and it will be available to users in an app and integrate with cloud storage and reporting. Our interdisciplinary
team combines the expertise of global health researchers, product usability testing experts, microscopists, and
data scientists.
In the R21 phase, we will collect the largest ever microscopy image set of STH and schistosome eggs (> 15
000). We will train an algorithm based on convolutional neural networks that make highly accurate parasite egg
classification (species identification) and embed this algorithm into a mobile app that works without internet
connectivity. To promote app utility, we will evaluate its accuracy and usability in a surveillance setting. We
established the feasibility of our approach in preliminary data by building a web app that serves the results of a
deep learning model that identifies STH and schistosome eggs with > 98% accuracy.
The R33 phase will be only undertaken if well-defined milestones are achieved. We will further develop the
mobile app as a data capture system that will integrate with cloud storage and a dynamic data visualization
system to enable increased accuracy in STH and schistosomiasis surveillance over time and across
geographic location. ​Validation studies will assess the​ benefits of the system to time and cost savings and
quality of data collected during surveillance activities. The overall goal of this work is to increase the accuracy
and streamline STH and schistosomiasis surveillance to enable effective decision-making in disease control."

Oxygen is administered to unconscious, mechanically ventilated patients following successful cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) from sudden cardiac arrest to ensure adequate oxygenation and to avoid potential worsening
tissue hypoxia. The liberal use of oxygen is near universal because it is regarded as benign and to be of potential
benefit. This dogma is being challenged by growing evidence that oxygen contributes to multi-organ injury and
decreased neurologically intact survival. Understanding the role of oxygen toxicity on post-CA outcomes
represents a major knowledge gap and barrier to improving outcomes. Antioxidants have not been found to be
beneficial and the patterns of injury and mechanism underlying its effects are poorly understood. This project
attempts to address these barriers by testing the effects of restricting oxygen availability through the
administration of hypoxia with a fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 10% between the first- and 7-hours following
CA. We term this therapy oxygen restriction therapy (O2RT). Paradoxically, O2RT increased oxygen
consumption, lowered biomarkers of glycolysis, decreased cellular injury and improved physiological recovery
of the heart and brain resulting in improved survival. In contrast, hyperoxia (FiO2 30%) or room air (FiO2 21%)
had the opposite effects. Both hyperoxia and normoxia following CA stabilized the hypoxia inducible factor 1a
(HIF1a) while O2RT lowered HIF1a. This finding is relevant because HIF1a regulates changes glycolysis and
inflammation. Our findings of HIF1a stabilization suggest potential worsening of tissue hypoxia by hyperoxia or
alternatively aberrant HIF1a stabilization resulting in aerobic glycolysis and inflammation that occurs in
pathologies like cancer. Aim1 further investigates the effects of O2RT vs. hyperoxia on post-CA injury during a
critical 6-hour window of injury. Aim 2 tests the influence of O2RT and hyperoxia on changing patterns of
breathing, blood flow, and metabolism in the heart and brain and Aim 3 interrogates the role of HIF1a in the
brain and heart using cell specific knock out mice. Success of this research will establish the role of oxygen in
mediating post-CA secondary injury while identifying a critical window of injury that can be targeted for
therapeutic benefit and identifying HIF1a as a new therapeutic target for limiting oxygen toxicity."

numbers of recording sites to target both local and distributed circuits, and importantly, minimally disrupt the
integrity of neural tissue and maintain functionality stably for long time periods. Neural electrodes have been a
primary tool for these purposes and contributed tremendously to fundamental and clinical neuroscience.
However, conventional neural electrodes are limited by the inability to consistently record high quality neural
signals over both the short and long terms. In time scales as short as hours substantial recording condition
changes often occur due to the micro-movements of the implanted electrodes relative to the brain tissue. Over
weeks to months, deterioration in recording efficacy and fidelity are caused by sustained foreign body reactions
at the tissue-probe interface including neural degradation, reoccurring leakage in capillaries and glial scar tissue
formation. The PI’s laboratory has previously created the ultraflexible neural electrodes. These devices are as
thin as only 1 µm (up to 5 – 8 for large animal brains) and are therefore extremely flexible, allowing for seamless
tissue integration with no observable neuronal degeneration and glial scaring. The overall objective of this project
is to develop an integrated, fully implanted and untethered system to democratize large-scale, chronic stable
neural recording. Empowered by this system, we will perform a comprehensive characterization on chronic
neural recordings tracking the same neuron populations, and delineate stable and drifting features. Our aims
are: AIM-1. To develop high-density NETs and their integration with implantable electronics. AIM-2.
Develop integrated circuits (IC) and electronics for distributed and untethered neural recording. AIM-3.
To establish a standard data set that characterizes endogenous changes in neural recordings.
Importantly, the approach is innovative, because the technology we will develop is expected to be the most
biocompatible large-scale neural recording and stimulation tool in neuroscience, and can enable new, very high-
density recording studies and lead to fundamental discoveries."
10881021,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Microglial-mediated neuroinflammation has long been recognized as a pathological hallmark of the
progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although many anti-inflammatory drug candidates have undergone
clinical trials as potential AD therapeutics, most have failed. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2
(TREM2) is a microglia-specific receptor that mediates intracellular cascades to modulate the production of
inflammatory cytokines and the phagocytosis of amyloid  (A) plaques. The interaction of TREM2 with
galectin-3 (Gal-3) stimulates proinflammatory activation of microglia and represents a promising target for
developing AD therapeutics that can alleviate neuroinflammation. In addition, stabilizing TREM2/A interaction
has been reported to enhance TREM2-mediated A phagocytosis in vivo. However, targeting TREM2 is
currently restricted to antibodies (Abs), and there are no small molecules in existence that target TREM2. To fill
this gap, we have developed an innovative platform, Small Molecules from Antibody Pharmacophores
(SMAPs), that can identify small molecule ligands for immune cell receptors with high binding affinity and
selectivity. Our SMAPs platform is based on utilizing cocrystal structures of immune cell receptors with Abs in
building pharmacophore maps from clusters of key interacting residues of Abs with immune cell receptors to
identify small molecules that modulate the function of immune cell receptors. We propose to establish a new
microglial modulating strategy to treat AD based on therapeutic targeting of TREM2 with small molecules
identified from the SMAPs platform. We identified a focused chemical library using our pharmacophore-based
virtual screening approach (SMAPs) based on interactions derived from a cocrystal structure of TREM2 and
anti-TREM2 Ab single-chain variable fragment (scFv) (PDB ID: 6Y6C). In comparison to Abs, small molecules
can readily cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and are amenable to pharmacokinetic optimization, which may
enable avoiding immune-related adverse events associated with Abs. Building on our successful work in
establishing screening platforms for TREM2-targeted small molecules, we hypothesize that small molecules
can bind a novel druggable binding site in TREM2, consequently enabling therapeutic modulation of TREM2
interaction with both Gal-3 and A. We will test our hypothesis and attain our objective via the following specific
aims: (1) screening the focused chemical using a panel of cell-free and cell-based assays, followed by hit-to-
lead optimization, and (2) evaluation of the optimized leads in an AD mouse model following an assessment of
their pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. This research will lay the groundwork for the therapeutic modulation of
TREM2 function using small molecules to develop new AD therapeutics."

Left ventricular (LV) pressure overload caused by conditions such as chronic hypertension or aortic stenosis is
a significant risk factor for the development of heart failure. A decline in microbial diversity caused by certain
antibiotics also increases the risk of heart failure, suggesting that the gut harbors cardioprotective microbes.
However, our current knowledge of which microbes are cardioprotective and which have deleterious cardiac
effects is inadequate, not allowing us to leverage gut microbial manipulation with antibiotics to treat or mitigate
heart failure. microRNA-204-5p (miR-204) is a noncoding RNA well-expressed in mouse and human hearts.
We recently reported that the miR-204 inhibits mouse myocardial hypertrophy induced by experimental
pressure overload, and its expression in many tissues, including the heart, is sensitive to changes in the gut
microbiome.
Our preliminary data show that glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin alters the mouse gut microbial landscape,
leading to the enrichment of Lactobacillus sp that confers protection from pressure overload-induced
myocardial hypertrophy and LV dysfunction. Moreover, vancomycin increases the abundance of the bacterial
metabolite tryptamine in the feces and serum, which inhibits myocardial hypertrophy and LV dysfunction. Both,
vancomycin and tryptamine stimulate cardiac miR-204 expression, which is essential for their cardioprotective
effects. Based on these data, we hypothesize that vancomycin-induced reshaping of the gut microbiome
enriches Lactobacillus sp. that promotes tryptophan's metabolism to tryptamine, leading to upregulation of
cardiac miR-204 that inhibits pressure overload-induced myocardial dysfunction.
This application will leverage unique reagents and tools to connect vancomycin-induced reshaping of the gut
microbiome to cardiac miR-204-regulated cardioprotection. The application will determine whether
vancomycin-induced enrichment of Lactobacillus sp. in the gut stimulates bacterial tryptophan metabolism to
confer protection from myocardial hypertrophy and LV dysfunction. Next, we will explore the role of cardiac
miR-204 in mediating the cardioprotective effect of vancomycin on pressure overload-induced myocardial
hypertrophy and LV dysfunction. We expect our study to identify specific microbes (e.g., Lactobacillus
murinus), metabolites (e.g., tryptamine), and signaling intermediaries (e.g., miR-204) that mediate the
cardioprotective effects of vancomycin.
There is a crucial knowledge gap in our understanding of how the gut microbiome modulates cardiac
contractile function. This gap is a hurdle to using gut microbiome manipulation as a therapeutic strategy for
heart failure. This application will narrow this gap by exploring a novel nexus between gut bacteria, bacterial
metabolites, and cardiac miR-204."
10899622,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Translation of eukaryotic mRNAs is highly regulated, and mutations that prematurely halt translation cause 11%
of all heritable human diseases. Yet, it is unknown how ribosomes rapidly and accurately identify stop codons to
halt protein synthesis and release the nascent polypeptide. It is also unclear how ribosomes trapped on an
aberrant mRNA, such as those devoid of a stop codon, are liberated by decay machinery. An understanding of
these fundamental processes could facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutics for diseases such as Cystic
Fibrosis, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and hereditary cancer syndromes. My central hypothesis is that the
slow rate at which aberrant mRNAs are translated by ribosomes is exploited by slowly-acting decay factors to
specifically degrade aberrant mRNAs and leave normal ones untouched. Examination of this hypothesis will
require real-time tracking of ribosomes translating normal or aberrant mRNAs, capturing intricacies of pathway
dynamics that are critical for regulation. As a postdoc in Joseph Puglisi’s lab at Stanford, I established single-
molecule assays to directly track individual eukaryotic ribosomes throughout termination using an in vitro-
reconstituted system. Co-mentored by Rachel Green, an expert in eukaryotic translation and mRNA decay, I will
extend these assays to monitor other key events in termination, recycling, and mRNA decay. I will further assess
the architecture of unique sub-states in translation and mRNA decay using cryo-EM. I propose the following
specific aims: (I) Decipher the mechanisms that ensure fidelity in eukaryotic termination; (II) Define the dynamics
that liberate ribosomes from normal and aberrant mRNAs; (III) Determine how termination, recycling, and mRNA
decay are regulated in humans. Together, the proposed aims will reveal how eukaryotic cells distinguish between
normal and aberrant mRNAs. Supported by my mentoring team, I will obtain expertise in cryo-EM, and the
additional training necessary to expand beyond my initial studies of translational control into related mRNA decay
mechanisms in yeast and humans. I will also become conversant in the language of genome-wide techniques
such as CRISPR screening and ribosome profiling. The proposed research and training activities will provide me
with the skills needed to establish an independent research program focused on the dynamic interplay of
eukaryotic translation and mRNA decay, and reveal fundamental facets of gene expression with relevance to
human health to be built upon in a future R01."
10880968,"Project Summary/Abstract
Despite over 65 years of electroencephalography (EEG) in newborn infants, our understanding of the rhythmic
cortical activity patterns associated with normal development and brain injury remains largely speculative. The
long term goal of the current project is to create a developmental activity atlas in which abberant EEG patterns
in the at-risk newborn are matched to specific disruptions in brain areas and neuronal types. A first step
towards this goal requires an un-anesthetized preclinical model with demonstrated homology to fetal and
neonatal human cortical activity in which cells can be genetically manipulated and the underlying effects on
cortical circuits rigorously probed. By measuring activity in vivo through the depth of cortex and corresponding
thalamic networks in developing neonatal rodents, we will provide insight into the circuit changes that may
underlie human fetal thalamo-cortical development to inform future studies of subcortical injury in infants and
non-human primates. By manipulating the activity of thalamic neurons we will assay the distinct contributions
of the thalamic relay and inhibitory neurons to the maturation of specific features of the EEG common to
developing humans and rodents. Given the challenges of imaging and diagnosis in the fragile at-risk newborn,
EEG has the potential to be a valuable and inexpensive bedside diagnostic tool. An improved understanding
of the control of cortical activity development will inform diagnosis after neonatal brain injury and improve
targeting of treatments for the cognitive and intellectual disability that often results."
10882038,"Summary
Lewy Body Dementias (LBDs) are a series of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by accumulation of
misfolded α‐synuclein (αS), including Dementia with Lewy Body (DLB), Parkinson’s Disease with Dementia
(PDD), and 1/3 of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). DLB is the 2nd most common dementia after AD accounting for 30%
of dementia cases; approximately 30% of AD cases suffer from α‐synucleinopathy resulting in a more rapid and
severe cognitive decline than AD alone. In brief, αS pathology is highly associated with AD and related dementias
(ADRD). Braak et al. identified that αS pathology spreading as disease progresses from a substantial number of
postmortem studies. Experimental studies have further demonstrated that misfolded αS seeds (i.e., brain
extracts, recombinant αS preformed fibrils (PFF) are prion-like particles that can exponentially propagate
pathology cell-to-cell, tissue-to-tissue, inducing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, driving the disease
progression and causing dementia. These αS seeds can enter cells and induce endogenous αS monomer
misfolding and aggregation, assessed with the immunoreactivity of anti-αS phosphorylated serine 129 (pS129),
a widely used pathological marker. The induced intracellular seeds can be released to extracellular spaces, and
then the extracellular seeds start a new cycle of cell-to-cell transmission. Because intracellular and extracellular
seeds can be easily interconverted, it brings the difficulty to cease cell-to-cell transmission of pathogenic αS. αS
pathology and propagation are observed mainly inside neurons, and αS is more abundant in neurons than in
glial cells, indicating that the intraneuronal αS significantly drives the pathogenesis. There have been
tremendous efforts on the development of antibodies against αS; however, due to the large size and structural
complexity, antibodies have limited penetrability through the plasma membrane. αS antibodies do not enter cells
and are inaccessible to intracellular αS seeds, but only to extracellular αS seeds. Furthermore, antibodies are
usually not functional in the reducing environment of the cytosol due to the reduction of the disulfide bonds,
which are critical for the correct folding of antibodies. In addition, antibody treatment could be costly and
inconvenient in long-term disease progression. It is hypothesized that blockage of intracellular αS propagation
could be effective against cell-to-cell αS transmission, and all these gaps indicate an urgent need to generate a
reagent targeting the intracellular pathogenic αS. In this application, we aim to develop novel nanobody-based
agents that can targeting these pathogenic αS to block cell-to-cell transmission."

Project Summary/Abstract
The acquisition of an Echo Confocal Microscope will provide a powerful tool for acquiring high resolution
three-dimensional (3D) immunofluorescence images for biological/biomedical applications within
California State University, Long Beach. Although conventional widefield microscopes enable high
resolution imaging of thin samples, the proper 3D reconstruction of thicker samples, such as cell-
embedded hydrogels or tissues, can only be completed by blocking out-of-focus light with a confocal
microscope. With an increasing demand in imaging of 3D structures, cells, and tissues for biomedical
research applications, an instrument capable of creating optical sections for 3D reconstruction is
essential. Faculty members in the biomedical engineering department currently have projects involving
the development of 3D biomaterials, microfluidics, and pancreas tissue/organoid development, which
would all greatly benefit from a confocal microscope for the visualization of 3D structures. In addition, the
Echo confocal is equipped with live imaging capabilities and reduces photobleaching by utilizing spinning
disk technology making data acquisition faster than traditional laser scanning confocal. The long-term
objective is to place the confocal microscope in a shared resource core microscopy/imaging facility
where faculty and students will be able to bring their samples to produce high quality 2D and 3D images.
Support of this core facility will enable/augment cross-discipline collaborative research within CSULB.
The user-friendly interface of the Echo Confocal Microscope will also accelerate the number of faculty
and students that can be trained for their research and/or educational projects. In addition, by housing
the confocal microscope adjacent to a classroom space the instrument will be readily accessible for
course laboratories and further provide additional hands-on-learning opportunities for students."
10882745,"Primary care accounts for only 2-7% of U.S. health care spending across payer populations, leading to an
underfunded primary care delivery system. In response, states are increasingly adopting policies to increase
spending on primary care, with the goal to improve prevention, chronic disease management, and slow the
growth of total health care spending.1-5 To date, 4 leading states—Rhode Island, Oregon, Delaware, and
Colorado—have enacted legislation or regulations to increase primary care spending, generally by requiring
private insurers to explicitly raise the percentage of health care spending spent on primary care.
 Despite the importance of these state efforts to invest in primary care, their effects on total spending, health
care utilization, and quality of care remain largely unknown. This dearth of rigorous evidence is increasingly
relevant, as additional states (including California, Maine, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania) are now debating
or designing similar legislation to increase primary care spending. To address this gap in knowledge, we will
conduct rigorous quasi-experimental evaluations, using newer matching techniques to improve causal
inference, of the Rhode Island, Oregon, Delaware, and Colorado models to raise primary care spending.
 The initial evaluation of the Rhode Island model, conducted by our team, focused on the model’s short-run
effects on commercial insurer spending. We found that Rhode Island’s commercial spending decreased by 9%
relative to enrollees from other states, with this reduction driven by the caps on hospital prices in the initial 4-6
years. However, as Rhode Island continues to sustain its primary care investments and other states look to do
the same, long-run evidence on the policy’s effect is absent. Moreover, knowledge of its effects on quality
of care, use of high and low value care, and spillovers in Medicare and Medicaid patients remains lacking.
 This project builds on our earlier work in four key ways. First, using large public and private claims data, we
will investigate changes in spending, utilization, and quality (both within and outside of primary care)
associated with the Oregon, Delaware, and Colorado models—all of which have been enacted. Oregon’s
legislation aims to raise primary care spending to 12% of total spending starting in 2023. Delaware’s model,
effective 2021, increases primary care spending by 1-1.5 percentage points each year until 2025. Colorado’s
model similarly increases primary care spending by 1 percentage point each year through 2023. Second, we
will extend our Rhode Island evaluation through a decade following the policy, with the key addition of
utilization and quality outcomes. Because it took a few years for the delivery system to respond, as our first
study showed, potentially important long-run effects have yet to be evaluated. Third, we use newer statistical
methods in matching and weighting within a quasi-experimental design to better isolate the policy effects.
Lastly, in all 4 states, we will assess spillover effects of their primary care investment across payers—into
the Medicare and Medicaid populations—which is important for both states and the federal government."

Vaccination of adults is central to control of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and multiple other infectious diseases.
Failure to engage in vaccine uptake is a complex, multilevel systems problem--individual factors such as
fatalism, lack of factual information, medical and government mistrust, and political affiliation are all known
inhibitors to vaccine uptake, as are community factors such as lack of access, limited delivery mechanisms,
and messages from untrusted communicators. Thus, addressing vaccine hesitancy requires a multilevel
intervention that aligns and addresses individual, relational, and structural elements to incorporate all of the
necessary and sufficient components to increase uptake. COVID-19 vaccine uptake among Appalachian
residents has been unacceptably low, with rates plateauing months ago. Appalachian Kentucky encompasses
a number of population characteristics that add up to a ""perfect storm"" for a vaccine hesitant population.
Structurally, the region is rural, with many communities geographically isolated and lacking access to health
care. This, in addition to poverty, low education and high levels of chronic disease, place this population at
significant risk of complications and mortality due to COVID-19 infection. In a population that historically has
distrusted institutions, vaccination interventions must leverage culturally appropriate community partnerships
and strategies. The purpose of this community-engaged study is to optimize SARS-CoV-2 vaccine uptake by
this highly vulnerable Appalachian Kentucky population. We will achieve three specific aims: Aim 1: Using a
community-engaged approach, elucidate: a) key themes for message content and framing that address
individual-level factors, b) trusted communicators to deliver culturally-sensitive messages, and c) structural
barriers to effective vaccine delivery, as well determining to what degree such factors are community-specific
versus more generalizable. Aim 2: Using a cluster randomized trial design, assess the efficacy of a multilevel
intervention that delivers individual-level target messaging tailored for theme and presentation by trusted local
communicators AND that provides structural components to facilitate easy and acceptable access to
vaccination delivery. Aim 3: Determine the process factors that affect reach, acceptance, and implementation
fidelity for the intervention components, as well as necessary adaptation components for broader
transferability, dissemination, and delivery of the intervention. Our long-term goal as a research team is to
develop effective, multilevel intervention strategies that can be used to address vaccine hesitancy in
Appalachian and similar rural populations for existing vaccination concerns."

 The Outreach Program To Inspire Minority and Underrepresented Students (OPTIMUS) within Moores
Cancer Center at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) seeks to create an engaging educational
experience for underrepresented minority high school students within the local San Diego region. The
overarching goal of this program aligns fully with the NCI's mission to increase diversity in the biomedical and
cancer research workforce.
 The first objective (OPTIMUS Scholars Program) aims to provide an engrossing summer cancer research
fellowship program for underrepresented minority high school students (OPTIMUS Scholars). This program will
pair OPTIMUS Scholars with supportive research faculty for a mentored research experience. The students will
concurrently participate in a complementary educational curriculum that covers core topics in cancer research,
coupled to an array of personal and professional development activities. This objective aims to generate a
lasting interest in science, healthcare, and cancer research among our underrepresented students.
 The second objective (OPTIMUS Associates Program) seeks to integrate UCSD biomedical trainees and
education graduate students (OPTIMUS Associates) in the educational and operational aspects of OPTIMUS.
We will create a new interprofessional course to teach our OPTIMUS Associates the skills required to create
and implement an outreach program such as OPTIMUS. We will then provide an experiential education
opportunity by incorporating our OPTIMUS Associates as apprentices into the operational aspects of the
OPTIMUS Scholars program. This objective strives to create a generation of biomedical trainees and
education graduate students who will become future leaders in creating and implementing community-based
research education programs such as OPTIMUS.
 The final objective (OPTIMUS Educational Outreach Program) will have OPTIMUS Scholars teach local
elementary school students in their community about basic concepts of cancer and cancer prevention. Our
OPTIMUS Scholars will partner with our OPTIMUS Associates to create an interactive age-appropriate
curriculum to deliver to these younger elementary school students. This objective partners with a local non-
profit STEM-focused organization called the Elementary Institute of Science. This objective stands to solidify
fundamental concepts of cancer among our OPTIMUS Scholars (learn by teaching), and will help teach
younger local elementary students about the fundamentals of cancer.
 Altogether, these three objectives with OPTIMUS leverage the diverse and supportive environment within
UCSD to help provide engaging opportunities for underrepresented students within our local community.
Support for our program will help us take important strides to creating a future cancer research workforce that
reflects the diversity of our community."
10883142,"Ricin, one of the most toxic substances known and a type B biothreat agent, has the same mechanism of
action as Shiga toxins (Stxs) produced by E. coli (STEC) and Shigella dysenteriae, which are foodborne
pathogens responsible for significant morbidity and mortality around the world. Despite years of research there
are no effective small molecule inhibitors of ricin or Stxs and as of now only supportive care is available.
Modulation of ribosome interactions by small molecules has not been previously explored as a strategy for
inhibition. We showed that ricin toxin A subunit (RTA) and the A1 subunit of Stx2a (Stx2A1) bind to the C-
terminal domain (CTD) of the ribosomal P-stalk proteins to depurinate the sarcin/ricin loop (SRL) at a distant
site on the large subunit of the ribosome. We identified the critical residues at the P-stalk binding site of RTA
and Stx2A1 and reported the first X-ray crystal structure of Stx2a with a P protein peptide and the first cryo-EM
structure of Stx2a holotoxin with the purified P-stalk pentamer. Peptides mimicking the CTD of P proteins bind
at a hydrophobic pocket on the opposite face of RTA/Stx2A1 relative to the active site and inhibit the activity of
both toxins, identifying the P-stalk binding site as a new target for developing small molecules. We set up
fragment-based lead discovery (FBLD) by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and discovered two fragments
that bind at the P-stalk binding site of RTA. Using structure-based design (SAR) we improved these inhibitors
and obtained lead compounds that inhibit the activity and cytotoxicity of ricin and Stx2a holotoxin in
mammalian cells. In this revised application, we propose to use a new fluorescence polarization assay to
enable robust SAR evaluation and the design of second-generation lead compounds that inhibit the activity of
ricin and Stx2a. We will test the hypothesis that the hydrophobic pocket at the P-stalk binding site of RTA and
Stx2A1 can serve as a highly druggable site for developing small molecules that can be used to dissect the
depurination mechanism of the ribosome inactivating proteins. In aim one, we will design new analogs based
on trends in SAR revealed from our recent work, to improve binding interactions while improving physical
properties. We will use docking and binding site analysis by SiteMap, WaterMap and FEP+ to optimize our
leads. We will determine the affinities using a new fluorescence polarization assay, analyze potency in cell-free
and cell-based assays and identify the binding modes by X-ray crystallography and NMR. A supplemental
virtual screen against RTA will be used to identify new chemical scaffolds and new binding elements to
combine with our current leads. In the second aim, we will use NMR analysis to investigate the mechanism of
action of lead compounds to test the hypothesis that P-stalk binding indirectly influences the active site
residues to allosterically regulate depurination activity at the catalytic site of RTA and Stx2A1. The product of
our efforts will be chemical tools to elucidate P-stalk binding and activation mechanisms and may result in
advanced lead compounds for the development of post-exposure therapeutics against ricin and STEC."
10882921,"Dry eye is a prevalent condition that significantly impacts the lives of millions of elderly adults worldwide,
causing ocular irritation and blurred vision, thereby severely affecting their overall quality of life. The
lacrimal gland (LG), responsible for producing the aqueous layer of the tear film, undergoes age-related
changes characterized by immune cell infiltration and impaired regenerative capacity. While calorie
restriction (CR) has been shown to slow down functional decline in various tissues, its specific effects on
LG inflammation remain to be fully understood. In our preliminary studies, we successfully generated the
first single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) atlas of the LG from both young and old mice fed ad libitum
(AL) and those subjected to a 40% calorie-restricted (CR) diet for a duration of six months. Our preliminary
findings indicate that the aging process is associated with a decline in mitochondrial and lipid metabolism,
a process regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α. This metabolic decline
contributes to the accumulation of lipids within the epithelial cells of the lacrimal gland. Additionally, we
observed an upregulation of the inflammasome pathway, leading to inflammasome activation in the LG
epithelial cells, production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, and Gasdermin-D cleavage.
Notably, our research revealed a compelling observation: CR effectively reversed the primary dry eye
phenotype associated with aging. In the LG, CR led to an elevation in PPAR-α and retinoid X receptor
(RXR) levels, thereby enhancing lipid and mitochondrial metabolism. Importantly, CR also resulted in a
significant enhancement of the expression of the epithelial progenitor cell markers. Our data suggests that
the molecular pro-resolving mechanism underlying CR involves the activation of PPAR-α signaling, that
in turn, leads to a reduction in lipid accumulation within the epithelial cells, thereby mitigating cell damage,
inflammasome formation and activation of immune cells. We hypothesize that the increase in PPAR-α is a
key mechanism by which CR protects epithelial cells from damage and enhances the function of lacrimal
gland (LG) progenitor cells. To test these hypotheses, our research will employ several approaches: 1) We
will utilize Nanostring GeoMX spatial transcriptomics combined with immunostaining and flow cytometry
to elucidate the specific effects of CR on epithelial cells and macrophages within the LG. 2) We will
evaluate the impact of modulating PPAR-α on the function of aging LG epithelial cells and the
inflammatory responses of immune cells. 3) Furthermore, we aim to determine the effect of PPAR-α
modulation on LG regeneration, as well as the growth, proliferation, and differentiation of progenitor cells
in LG organoids. By investigating the mechanisms underlying CR, we hold the potential to develop
interventions for age-associated LG inflammation and dry eye. This research offers promising prospects for
addressing these conditions and advancing the field of ocular health."
10884515,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The COVID-19 pandemic prompted governments to implement a range of public health measures, including
school closures, to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, the role of in-school transmission of SARS-CoV-
2, what mitigation levels and testing policies are needed, and the value of school closures have been
contentious issues. In-person school closures or quarantine policies that prevent students from being in school
can have immediate and long-lasting negative impacts on child development. In New York City, the calculated
magnitude of student-level learning losses due to COVID-19 and the transition away from classroom-based
instruction was on average 125 (69%) and 212 (118%) days of reading and math, respectively, relative to a
typical 180-day school year. Across the United States, reduced educational attainment is estimated to translate
into a loss of four to five percent of lifetime earning wages. Thus, opening schools to in-person learning is an
important step in re-opening the economy and promoting development and success of students; however, it
comes with the danger of increasing contact networks and transmission opportunities. To assess this trade-off
and the potential for increased transmission, we will build models to incorporate school-level infection
monitoring data along with community-level testing data, vaccination data, immunological and serological
indicators among students and faculty, in addition to built environment indicators of school settings. These
models will allows us to determine associations between community-level transmission rates and test positivity
rates within schools (Aim 1), develop an epidemiological disease transmission model that identifies how to
cost-effectively collect sentinel school surveillance data (Aim 2), and identify policy trigger points to predict
when interventions should be implemented in schools to prevent disease transmission (Aim 3). Although I have
the requisite engineering background and experience developing infectious disease models, additional training
will maximize success of the proposed project and catalyze a robust independent research program. To
accomplish these goals, I will obtain additional training in biological sciences and public health, particularly in
community engagement, immunology, virology, and epidemiology. I will develop these skills through didactic
training, independent study, and mentorship from experts in these fields: Drs. Maida Galvez, Rachel Vreeman,
Jeffrey Shaman, Andrea Graham, Nicole Bouvier, and Chris Gennings. At the end of this training period, I will
be uniquely positioned to comprehensively examine the effects of respiratory disease transmission in future
research. Further, I will use the knowledge gained and the developed disease transmission models in future
grant applications, establishing a crucial step toward my long-term goal of optimally designing infectious
disease monitoring networks to reduce the spread of disease and improve the health of communities."

The long-range objective of our laboratory is to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which
signaling pathways and downstream transcription factors coordinate the specification of adrenocortical cells
within the adrenal gland. Our goal during this grant cycle is to define mechanisms by which the transcription
factor HHEX specifies identity and function of cells in the inner zona fasciculata (zF). Based on our preliminary
data, we hypothesize that HHEX is a requisite factor for the enhanced glucocorticoid secretion during chronic
stress adaptations; together with androgen-driven lipid catabolism and tissue renewal in the adrenal zF.
To this end, our strategy and specific aims for this proposal are designed to 1) Define the intracellular
mechanisms by which HHEX regulates the identity and function of the glucocorticoid-producing inner zF cells
that are enriched during chronic stress (Abcb1b+ inner zF population), 2) Determine the contribution of HHEX to
transcriptional programs the underly dynamic androgen-driven sterol flux in the adrenal zF and, 3) Characterize
the role of HHEX in adrenal zF tissue renewal.
The studies proposed here will provide fundamental knowledge of cellular heterogeneity in the adrenal cortex,
specifically the cell populations producing glucocorticoids during stress adaptation, and will provide the
groundwork for future clinical insights and therapeutic treatments for patients with chronic diseases of adrenal
insufficiency and stress-related disorders."

Recent large genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds to thousands of genetic
variants associated with complex traits. The resulting GWAS summary statistics, together with large Biobank
data, provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand the genetic mechanisms of complex traits. Inferring
causal effects of risk factors on disease is the major challenge of observational epidemiology studies, which now
can be addressed using genomic data through the cost-efficient Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach.
However, current MR approaches suffer from bias due to multiple sources, including weak instrument variables
(IVs), sample overlap, horizontal pleiotropy, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) among IVs. Novel statistical
methods that can unbiasedly infer causality and estimate causal effects are therefore needed. On the other hand,
one of the dominant views in the field is that genetic variation of complex disease is largely explained by additive
effects. Even though gene-environment and gene-gene interactions have been well documented in experiment
studies, the contribution of interactions is still unclear, partially because of limitations of current analytic
approaches. The current methodological development focuses on improving computational efficiency to
overcome the burden from the large number of interaction tests at the genome wide level, but the fundamental
method is based on standard linear regression that often has low statistical power. In this project, we will develop,
(1) novel unbiased multivariable MR with application to large genomics data and Biobank data, (2) novel powerful
gene-environment interaction (𝐺 × 𝐸) methods with application to large genomics and Biobank data, (3) a novel
powerful gene-gene interaction (𝐺 × 𝐺) method with application to large genomics and Biobank data, (4)
corresponding software that will be made publicly available. We will apply these methods and software to UK

support to develop statistical methods and software to address these goals. The proposed novel multivariable
MR methods and 𝐺 × 𝐸 and 𝐺 × 𝐺 methods would speed up the new discoveries and improve our understanding

10927452,"Project Summary/Abstract
Vision loss is a devastating medical problem that generates significant medical costs, directly as well as
indirectly in the form of decreased productivity, lower quality of life, and loss of independence among those
affected. In the United States, disorders of the eye result in a significant economic burden for society. Because
the human retina has minimal or no regenerative ability, loss of retinal neurons due to intrinsic defects or
environmental insults is generally irreversible, making this the most common cause of permanent visual
impairment. In this project, the candidate proposes to study the development of retinal ganglion cells, the
output projection neurons that connect the eye with the brain. These neurons are vulnerable to injury in
traumatic optic nerve injuries and to diseases such as glaucoma, and a deeper understanding of their
development and regeneration could have significant implications for reversing visual impairment. In the first
part of this application, the candidate proposes to investigate the function of a transcription factor expressed by
retinal ganglion cells in a mouse line with this gene conditionally deleted, and by using overexpression in
retinal progenitor cells in vivo. In the second part of this application, the candidate proposes to screen a
candidate list of transcription factors by overexpression in vivo for their ability to reprogram endogenous retinal
cells to produce new retinal ganglion cells. Overall, insights from the study of normal retinal ganglion cell
development will be applied to develop methods for replacing these cells when they are damaged or diseased.
The candidate’s overall career goal is to understand developmental processes that shape the nervous system,
and to apply this developmental knowledge to regenerate neurons lost to injury or disease. The candidate has
a deep background in cerebral cortical developmental biology and proposes to receive training in retinal
development because the retina is significantly more accessible to clinical manipulation, and promising
regenerative therapies are already beginning to come to fruition. During the mentored phase of this award, the
candidate will prioritize undertaking activities to increase understanding of retinal development, to do
productive and meaningful science, and consequently to transition research from cerebral cortical development
to retinal development. The PI will work with mentors Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg and Dr. Sui Wang, together with
members of a Stanford faculty advisory team. The proposed research and training plans will take place in the
laboratory of Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg, chair of the Department of Ophthalmology at Stanford University School of
Medicine. The outstanding vision science group at Stanford is embedded within the world-class neuroscience
and broader life sciences community at Stanford as a whole, with benefits of a close-knit and focused
department and the resources of the wider university."
10874138,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a major hurdle with 5-year survival of
12%. PDAC resistance to chemotherapy and immunotherapy is thought to arise from the immunosuppressive
tumor microenvironment (TME), characterized by a fibrotic stroma and high infiltrates of immunosuppressive
cells, including tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs block anti-tumor effector T cell function and
trigger exhaustion. It has been postulated that reprogramming TAMs to an immunostimulatory phenotype
could improve therapy response. Recent studies suggest that metabolites originating from the gut microbiome
influence phenotype of immune cells, including TAMs. However, little is understood about such metabolites,
including their identity, the signaling pathways by which they alter TAM phenotype, and whether these
metabolites influence cancer development. We are identifying microbial metabolites that modulate TAMs in
the PDAC TME. Using unbiased, global, LC-MS/MS metabolomic screens, we found a gut microbe-derived
metabolite, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) that induced significant anti-tumor effects in the PDAC TME.
Specifically, delivery of TMAO intraperitoneally, or by supplementing diet with the TMAO precursor choline,
to PDAC-bearing mice reduced tumor growth and was associated with an immunostimulatory TAM phenotype
and activated effector T cell response in the TME. The immunostimulatory macrophage phenotype was due
to a direct effect of TMAO and the TMAO-conditioned macrophages could activate CD8+ T cells. Combining
TMAO with immune checkpoint blockade reduced tumor burden and improved anti-tumor immune responses.
These data support our hypothesis that the diet and microbiome-derived metabolites shape anti-tumor
immunity and treatment response in PDAC. Aim 1 will characterize dietary and microbial sources of TMAO
for anti-tumor responses in PDAC. We will characterize the (i) dietary (l-carnitine or betaine), and (ii) the
microbiome (e.g., Enterococcus asini, engineered E. coliCutC/D) sources of TMAO for their anti-tumor effects.
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that TMAO induces its anti-tumor effects by potentiating the type I IFN and/or
STING signaling in TAMs. We will determine (i) the requirement of type-I IFN and/or STING specifically in
macrophages for the anti-tumor effects, and (ii) the impact of TMAO on the transcriptional activity of type-I
IFN responsive STAT1 and/or STAT3. Aim 3 will test the efficacy of TMAO to improve treatment response in
pre-clinical models of PDAC. We will evaluate the translational relevance of TMAO using (i) a genetically
engineered mouse model of PDAC and patient derived PDAC organoid cultures, and (ii) a treatment strategy
combining TMAO with STING agonists. Our studies will characterize the sources, mechanism of action, and
translational relevance of a novel, minimally understood, high impact microbial metabolite, TMAO, in boosting
anti-tumor immune responses in the PDAC TME and rendering PDAC responsive to chemo-immunotherapy.
In the longer term, this work may lay the groundwork for new diet/microbiome-based treatments for PDAC."

Emerging evidence suggests that childhood cancer survivors treated without central nervous system (CNS)
directed therapies are at significant risk for neurocognitive impairment that is associated with decreased social
attainment and quality of life. However, the underlying biological mechanisms of neurocognitive impairment in
this population are poorly understood limiting our ability to prevent or alleviate these adverse outcomes. Long-
term survivors of childhood cancer have a higher frequency of frailty and chronic health conditions than sibling
controls suggesting cancer therapy may accelerate the physiological and biological aging process, which may
lead to neurocognitive impairment. Studies in the general population indicate systemic inflammation and
oxidative stress increase with age and are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and cognitive decline.
Inflammation and oxidative stress are also important regulators of telomere length and epigenetic changes which
have been associated with neurocognitive impairment in aging non-cancer populations. These biomarkers have
yet to be extensively examined in childhood cancer survivors treated without CNS directed therapies. The
objective of this K99R00 is to identify aging-related biological predictors of neurocognitive impairment and
subsequent decline in order to inform the design of future interventions using existing data and biospecimens
from 300 HL survivors and 200 community controls in the St. Jude Lifetime cohort. Specifically, the K99 phase
aims to examine cross-sectional associations between markers of inflammation, oxidative stress,
immunosenescence, and cellular aging (telomere length and epigenetic age acceleration) with neurocognitive
impairment in long-term Hodgkin lymphoma survivors (HL). The R00 phase will expand on these findings by first
describing the trajectory of neurocognitive decline in long-term HL survivors and then by examining longitudinal
associations between these biomarkers and subsequent neurocognitive decline. Further, these studies will
provide data on the influence of modifiable risk factors (e.g. exercise, smoking, nutrition) on these biomarkers to
inform future development of interventions to mitigate neurocognitive impairment in cancer survivors. Dr.
Williams is an emerging translational cancer control epidemiologist focused on underlying pathophysiologic and
biologic mechanisms of neurocognitive function in cancer survivors. The K99R00 allows Dr. Williams to develop
expertise in 1) neurobiology and cancer biology and treatment specific to HL, 2) aging-related biomarkers and
molecular epidemiology, 3) complex statistical methods and 4) clinical and behavioral intervention trials. Dr.
Williams' mentoring team has extensive expertise in neurocognitive assessments, neuropathology, molecular
epidemiology, childhood cancer, and statistical methods. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital is an
international leader in cancer control and survivorship and provides a resource-rich training environment for Dr.
Williams. The combined training and research plan will ensure Dr. Williams' transition to independence by
providing the skills and preliminary data to successfully compete for future R01-level grants."

of Surgery at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The goal of our program entitled -
“Training of Surgeon Scientists in Basic and Translational Cancer Research” - is to improve the
training of future surgeon cancer scientists. With the proposed continuation of this program, we
seek to provide a platform to train highly motivated surgical residents with an interest to pursue
a career in research and clinical surgery and who aspire to become surgeon scientists with a
focus on cancer. Our program is designed for surgical residents in the department of surgery to
spend two years dedicated to training in the conduct of basic and translational research. Based
on our success to date we seek to expand our initial program from one that focused on the
tumor microenvironment to a program that addresses more broadly the cancer biology research
programs in the Albert Einstein Cancer Center (AECC). Advances in the understanding of the
mechanisms controlling tumor initiation, progression, invasion and metastasis as well as the role
of the immune system in tumor growth inhibition are examples of the themes and coordination
of the programs in the AECC. By bringing together a team of mentors with a strong track record
of research accomplishments as well as sustained experience in training post-graduate fellows,
we plan to address an unmet need in the preparation of surgeons for a career in cancer
research. Our application includes outstanding faculty mentors and co-mentors representing 5
clinical departments and 4 basic science departments. The 14 faculty members include 12
senior mentors and 2 junior mentors. We have also included in our faculty 4 surgical faculty
advisors and two didactic faculty. The training program will consist of two years of laboratory
research, formal coursework and participation in relevant journal clubs and seminars. The
training will also include participation in the department of surgery’s annual research day and
attendance at departmental and professional conferences and relevant workshops. Successful
trainees will have submitted at least two abstracts to national meetings and at least one original
manuscript for peer review by the completion of the training program. The curriculum is
designed to prepare the trainee to pursue a career as a surgeon scientist. The program is
structured with a formal evaluation process in place to evaluate trainee, mentor and overall

10876292,"This is a resubmission application for a K01 AHRQ Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award. I
am a faculty junior researcher at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center who is currently supported by an AHRQ-
sponsored F32 National Research Service Award Postdoctoral Fellowship (1F32HS027286-01A1). My long-term
research career goal is to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving rural
cancer healthcare delivery. The protected time supported by this four-year award will allow me to acquire new
skills and develop expertise in healthcare delivery interventions and has the following main goals: 1) obtain
training in the development and testing of healthcare delivery interventions, interventional clinical trials, and
implementation science, and 2) professional development. To achieve these goals, I have established a
mentoring team comprised of a senior investigator in cancer clinical research (Dr. Berenberg, primary mentor),
a nationally recognized expert in interventional trials (Dr. Hershman), a national leader in cancer health services
research (Dr. Holcombe), and faculty with expertise in behavioral intervention (Dr. Cassel) and implementation
science (Dr. Okamoto). These mentors and two consulting members will provide guidance on the proposed
training and research activities designed to facilitate my transition from a junior researcher to an independent
health services researcher. Although advances in treatment have improved overall survival of patients with
cancer, death rates from all cancers among rural residents in the United States are 10% higher than those living
in urban areas. Higher cancer mortality rates in rural areas are thought to, in part, reflect limited access to
specialty cancer care. A potential strategy to reduce these disparities is to increase access to high-quality cancer
clinical trial care in rural areas; however, there are numerous barriers to clinical trial enrollment in rural areas. To
address these barriers, in collaboration with my mentoring team, I will develop and pilot test CTNow, a multi-
component, multilevel interactive electronic tool that combines patient and provider cancer clinical trial education
and a real-time videoconference system that enables rural patients and providers to access a clinical trial team
for consultation, referral, and clinical trial enrollment. The proposed research has the following aims: 1) conduct
a formative mixed-methods evaluation with rural oncology providers and patients to assess capabilities and the
contextual factors of the rural intervention settings, 2) develop and pilot test CTNow for rural patients and
providers, and 3) identify remaining barriers and facilitators to rural clinical trial participation and strategies to
support future implementation of CTNow. My training and research will be conducted at one of the 71 National
Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers with a well-established program in cancer care delivery research.
During years 3 and 4, I will develop and submit an R01 application to propose a multi-site, hybrid effectiveness-
implementation study conducted through rural NCORP sites. My current and future research aims are closely
aligned with AHRQ’s mission to improve health care delivery in a high priority population residing in rural areas."
10876441,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
This K08 application is designed to provide Dr. Robert Dorschner, MD, the scientific training and professional
development required to become an independent investigator in the field of cutaneous host defense. The
advent of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has significantly increased the morbidity of skin
and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). There is a great need for innovation to better understand host defense of the
skin and to develop alternative therapies. Neutrophils are a key component of cutaneous host-defense, yet
neutrophil-targeted therapies are lacking. The long-term goal of this proposal is to train the PI through a project
that will advance an understanding of innate mechanisms that regulate neutrophil recruitment and activation in
cutaneous inflammation and infection. His preliminary data demonstrate that the leukocyte surface protein
ECRG4 promotes early neutrophil recruitment to cutaneous injury and regulates CD44 expression. The central
hypothesis is that ECRG4 enhances the inflammatory response to contain and eliminate cutaneous infection
through its ability to amplify neutrophil recruitment and regulate CD44 signaling. The rationale for this project is
that a determination of novel neutrophil recruitment mechanisms will enable therapeutic targeting of molecules
like ECRG4 for neutrophil-directed therapies to enhance host defense against antibiotic resistant microbes. Dr.
Dorschner will apply molecular and cell biology techniques to ECRG4 KO mice and human leukocytes to: 1)
Determine the role of ECRG4 in host defense against cutaneous staph aureus infection, 2) Assess its
regulation of neutrophils with in vivo and ex vivo models, and 3) Define the effect of ECRG4 regulated CD44
expression on neutrophil recruitment and function. These findings will demonstrate a novel mechanism
controlling early inflammatory responses to infection that can be translated to the development of anti-infective
therapies. To achieve this, Dr. Dorschner has assembled an interdepartmental mentoring team with experience
launching junior investigators into independent research careers. His primary mentors from the Department of
Surgery are Dr. Brian Eliceiri, PhD, an expert in immune cell trafficking and inflammation, and Dr. Andrew
Baird, PhD, an expert in wound healing. Additional clinician-scientist mentors from the Department of
Dermatology provide further expertise in cutaneous immunity and inflammation research and clinician-scientist
career development. This training plan implements 1) acquisition of scientific and technical expertise in
neutrophil biology and signaling using mouse and human models 2) training in grant writing, clinical research
and biostatistics 3) generation of data for a successful R01 submission, and a 4) planned transition to
independence through ongoing professional development. This work takes place within the outstanding
scientific environment at UCSD in the Departments of Surgery and Dermatology. This training plan builds on
Dr. Dorschner's previous research and clinical training to position him as a leading clinician-scientist with an
independent R01-funded research program focused on neutrophil driven cutaneous inflammatory responses."
10876463,"Project Summary
Metazoan development relies on precise and reproducible cell fate decisions. However, the molecular events
underlying these decisions, namely transcriptional activation of subsets of genes, are inherently stochastic. The
goal of the proposed study is to bridge this gap by uncovering how precise patterns emerge from dynamic gene
activation. Our past work was mostly focused on the readout of regulatory DNA sequences, such as enhancers,
controlling the activation of a target gene. However, during the previous funding cycle, we identified the functional
importance of the large chromosomal distances over which this regulation takes place, contributing to often rate-
limiting dynamics and adding an extra source for stochasticity. Numerous studies in the past decade have
pointed to the prevalence of such long-range chromosomal interactions adding another layer of complexity to
the regulation of gene expression. However, investigation of temporal dynamics of chromatin is strongly limited
by the prevalent use of bulk assays using fixed material, and traditional imaging methods often lack the
spatiotemporal resolution to accurately capture the dynamics of gene activity. Here we propose to overcome
these limitations by developing new imaging approaches and computational analyses to provide a dynamic
picture of chromosomal architecture and its causal relationship to transcription. For this purpose, we will
capitalize on the advantages of the early Drosophila embryo for the development of quantitative live imaging
methods. In this system, changes in segmentation gene expression are position-specific determinants of cell-
type identity. We will thus examine regulatory interactions at scales characteristic to flies and mammals (from
tens to hundreds of kilobases) and their implications in the context of cellular specification in a developing
organism. The proposed studies will help understand how robust cell type specification emerges from the
stochastic gene expression that is regulated by long-range interactions and chromatin architecture. The following
three complementary hypotheses are tested: 1) distinct locus-specific architectures generate different functional
outputs; 2) physical order underlies long-distance chromosomal relationships; 3) a functional relationship exists
between chromatin dynamics and activity. The overall goal of this project is to establish a quantitative link
between chromatin architecture and transcriptional activity, which will ultimately lead us to regulate and re-
engineer transcriptional programs underlying development and disease processes."

Sepsis remains the leading cause of hospital mortality today.1 Despite its increasing incidence due to an aging
population with greater comorbidities, in-hospital mortality has significantly declined over the past decade.2 This
is due in large part to earlier recognition and better compliance with best practices in early sepsis management.
Despite improved in-hospital mortality, a large proportion (up to 50% in some studies)3-5 of sepsis survivors never
fully recover and develop chronic critical illness (CCI), characterized by persistent immune suppression,
recurrent infections, sepsis recidivism and poor long-term outcomes. There are three key challenges, however,
hindering the development of immunological therapies in these sepsis survivors: i) how to endotype patients with
sepsis who are immunosuppressed; ii) how to quantify the degree of immune suppression; and iii) how to identify
promising immune stimulants in individual immunosuppressed patients? We believe that current efforts to
endotype sepsis survivors as being immunosuppressed have not been fully successful because they fail to
directly assess immune function, instead using either genomic or proteomic measures of immune status. Here
we propose to: 1) assess whether stimulated T cell production of IFN-γ and stimulated monocyte production of
TNF as quantitated by ELISpot, better predicts infectious and long-term outcomes in sepsis survivors than
common static measurements based on protein levels, expression and nucleic acid concentrations; and 2) to
employ ELISpot assessment of IFN- production by T-cells and TNF production by monocytes from sepsis
survivors to examine ex vivo the comparative efficacy of different immune stimulants to reverse sepsis-induced
immunosuppression. To achieve these goals, we propose a prospective, observational trial of 270 patients with
sepsis (using Sepsis-3 criteria) compared to 90 patients with critical illness without sepsis (total of 390 with 30
healthy subjects for quality control and validation) at 3 academic institutions. At 1, 4 and 7 days post sepsis
diagnosis, blood samples will be obtained and blood T-cell and monocyte production of IFN- and TNF,
respectively, will be determined by ELISpot. In addition, samples will be obtained for other biomarkers, including
plasma proteins (IL-6 and sPD-L1), CD14+ cell expression of HLA-DR, total lymphocyte count and whole blood
genomics. Secondary infections will be the primary clinical index of outcome6, with secondary indices including
hospital readmission, and 180 day mortality. In addition, we will evaluate in this ELISpot platform the ex vivo
response of IFN- production by T-cells and TNF production by monocytes stimulated with varying
concentrations of IL-7, anti-PD-1 mAb, GITRL, OX40L or 4-1BB, using a randomized block design. These
immune stimulants are currently under consideration as potential therapeutics for sepsis patients. This
application proposes the validation of a novel functional bioassay to identify patients who would benefit from
immunotherapy, and to identify different immune therapies that would benefit the individual patient."
10874016,"Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) decreases vision quality and can progress to vision loss, for
which 17,000 individuals/year require corneal transplantation in the United States. The hallmarks of FECD are
the progressive accumulation of deposits (guttae) on the basement (Descemet’s) membrane of the corneal
endothelium and progressive loss of corneal endothelial cells (CEnCs). These changes are present in all forms
of FECD regardless of genetic background. But it is unknown how guttae form or how this contributes to CEnC
dysfunction. Novel preliminary data in support of this project show that guttae-like structures can be developed
in cell culture. Long-term culture of primary bovine CEnCs (BCEnCs) leads to guttae development in the
extracellular matrix (ECM) secreted by the cells. The guttae are most prominent under conditions of high
glucose and/or low oxygen, which are environments that favor glycolysis over oxidative respiration. The
pathological ECM developed under these conditions does not favorably support the growth of non-diseased
human CEnCs. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a common pathway leading to the development
of guttae in the ECM of CEnCs is glycolytic metabolism from mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, the
composition of the pathological ECM does not support the growth and metabolism needs of healthy CEnCs.
The objectives of the proposed studies are to identify the metabolic pathways that contribute to guttae
formation and to understand how pathological ECM disrupts CEnC function. The objectives will be achieved
with three Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to identify alterations in ECM composition resulting from oxygen stress in
CEnCs, and to compare those alterations to changes in FECD patient specimens. The composition of BCEnC-
secreted ECM, non-diseased human Descemet’s membrane, and patient FECD specimens will be compared
with quantitative proteomics analyses. Aim 2 is to discover CEnC stressors that lead to the formation of guttae.
BCEnCs will be subjected to disruptors of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis to determine the conditions
favoring guttae formation. Aim 3 is to analyze the growth and metabolic profile of human CEnCs grown on
pathological ECM and the role of the actin cytoskeleton. Human CEnCs will be seeded on pathological ECM
for measurements of cell growth, cell stiffness (a measure of the actin cytoskeleton), mitochondrial
morphology, and cellular respiration. Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide (i) a biological
model with guttae generation for studying CEnC–ECM interactions where both components can be
manipulated, (ii) insight into how metabolic stressors of CEnCs that are potential targets for future therapeutics
generate ECM changes, and (iii) knowledge of how the ECM can alter CEnC function. These tools and
knowledge will be valuable for the study of FECD development and drug discovery."

This competing continuation application seeks an additional five years of support for a pre- and post-doctoral
training program in the psychology of alcohol and addiction. The training program is housed in the Department
of Psychological Sciences at the University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) and has been led by Kenneth J. Sher
since its inception in 2002. The program takes advantage of a concentration of alcohol and addiction scientists
at MU, as well as affiliated addiction scientists at the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and
MU’s sister campus, the University of Missouri – St. Louis (UMSL). The program has had remarkable success
in producing addiction scientists who have gone on to noteworthy careers at leading institutions. The program
will be co-directed by Drs. McCarthy and Sher for the proposed award period.
The 28 training faculty includes both Preceptors and Secondary Mentors, with Preceptors serving as primary
mentor and coordinator of a trainee’s experiences. Trainees are mentored to develop the skills and competencies
needed to become independent investigators, direct their own research programs, and serve as effective
members of multidisciplinary research teams. Trainees are drawn from Psychological Sciences, but receive
training in the diverse research areas represented among the training faculty, including molecular and behavior
genetics, behavioral pharmacology, nosology, cognitive neuroscience, ecological assessment, comorbidity,
psychophysiology, community-based research, longitudinal research, clinical interventions, health disparities,
decision making, and quantitative methods. Training that integrates biological, psychological, and social factors
is critical for advancing alcohol and addiction science, as the next generation of researchers must adapt to rapidly
changing science and function effectively in multidisciplinary research teams.
For the proposed period of award, we request to maintain our current level of 6 pre-doctoral and 3 post-doctoral
trainees for all 5 years of support. Pre-doctoral trainees will typically have a two-year training period, while post-
doctoral trainees will typically have a three-year training period. Pre-doctoral trainees are guaranteed a total of
five years of support from the Department, and will be supported by other mechanisms (e.g., fellowships,
research assistantships, F31 awards) in the remaining years of training. Post-doctoral trainees typically will move
into faculty or research scientist positions at the conclusion of their period of support, usually at other institutions.
Program specific training components include: 1) a formal course in alcohol and addiction studies, 2) a weekly
program workshop, 3) required non-thesis/dissertation research, 4) a grant writing course and writing workshop,
5) attendance at regularly scheduled colloquia, 6) attendance at the annual RSA meeting, and 7) some exposure
to alcohol-related clinical experiences (for some pre-doctoral trainees). Post-doctoral trainees typically have
additional experiences tailored to fit their training needs. The training program is evaluated on an ongoing basis
through both informal and formal means."

 Chemosensory systems contribute extensively to social behavior in humans and other mammals,
including mice, a predominant animal model for diseases and disorders that impact human social
function. We propose to study the neural circuitry of the accessory olfactory system in order to better
understand how this system extracts information from chemical messages and informs social
behavior. Without improved understanding of these processes, we risk making mistakes in the
interpretation of studies seeking new therapies for diseases and disorders involving social behavior.
 The activity of excitatory projection neurons called mitral cells (MCs) in the first neural circuit in the
accessory olfactory system, called the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), strongly influences
reproductive physiology and social behavior. AOB mitral cell activity is tightly controlled by several
types of GABAergic interneurons: juxtaglomerular cells, external granule cells, and internal granule
cells (IGCs). We and others have identified that AOB IGCs undergo experience-dependent plasticity
following chemosensory social behaviors. We will investigate the hypothesis that these cells, and
perhaps other AOB interneurons, are involved in social behavior plasticity.
 We will use multiple physiological techniques to investigate cellular and synaptic physiology in
AOB interneurons that undergo experience-dependent plasticity. We will investigate how experience-
dependent plasticity modulates interneuron excitability, morphology, and gene transcription. We will
determine how interneuron plasticity influences MC chemosensory tuning in vivo and ex vivo using
chemogenetics, optogenetics, and live calcium imaging. Finally, we will investigate the impacts of
inhibitory plasticity on brain-wide patterns of neuronal activation and social behavior during repeated
social encounters. Combined, these studies will fill major gaps in our understanding of chemosensory
information processing, experience-dependent plasticity, and mammalian social behavior."

TRPV4 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 4) is a calcium-permeable ion channel whose activation has been
implicated in both hereditary and acquired neurological diseases. Gain-of-function mutations cause debilitating
forms of hereditary motor neuron disease and neuropathy/neuronopathy for which no treatment exists. In
addition, increased TRPV4 ion channel activity is implicated in multiple other neurological diseases. While the
association of TRPV4 with disease and the availability of TRPV4 antagonist drugs make TRPV4 a promising
therapeutic target, fundamental aspects of TRPV4 signaling and function remain poorly understood. To
address this knowledge gap, we have generated cellular, fly, and mouse models of TRPV4-associated nerve
disease. Unbiased studies in these models have identified the calcium-regulated actin remodeling proteins
RhoA, CaMKII, and INF2 as critical downstream mediators of TRPV4 signaling. In addition, novel TRPV4
mutant knock-in mice, which develop severe neuromuscular disease that rapidly progresses to death, have
unexpectedly demonstrated that increased TRPV4 activation within neural vascular endothelial cells (ECs)
drives pathological disruption of blood-neural barriers (BNBs). Together, these results suggest that TRPV4
causes neurodegeneration through dysregulation of actin cytoskeletal remodeling in ECs, resulting in BNB
breakdown. As BNB disruption is a common pathological event in a variety of degenerative and traumatic
neurological diseases, effective therapeutic strategies to limit BNB breakdown would have far-reaching clinical
value. Here, we propose a series of complementary studies utilizing in vitro models of neural vascular ECs and
TRPV4 knock-in mice to further define the molecular mechanisms by which TRPV4 modulates the actin
cytoskeleton and BNB integrity. In Specific Aim 1, we will use a combination of dynamic molecular biosensors,
candidate-based biochemical assessments, and unbiased phospho-proteomics to define downstream TRPV4
signaling events and their temporal activation profiles. Specific Aim 2 will address the contribution of the
calcium-sensitive actin remodeling proteins RhoA, CaMKII, and INF2 to TRPV4-mediated calcium influx and
modulation of cellular morphology and BNB integrity. In Specific Aim 3, we will use TRPV4 knock-in mice to
investigate the topographic and temporal patterns of actin modulating protein activation in the context of
TRPV4-mediated BNB disruption. We will also determine the contribution of RhoA and INF2 activity to TRPV4
knock-in phenotypes, including motor behavior, BNB disruption, and survival. Together, these studies will
delineate TRPV4-mediated signaling cascades that modulate cytoskeletal changes and barrier function in
neural vascular ECs. These results will define specific molecular pathways that modulate BNB integrity and
reveal therapeutic opportunities to limit pathological BNB disruption in neurological disease."

A demographic transition that is currently underway in the United States will require an increased investment in
the managed care of the elderly population. By 2030, people over 65 will account for over 20% of the population,
and as many as 1 in 3 people will develop some form of dementia after their 65th birthday. However, society has
yet to determine how to manage the burden of providing round-the-clock care for elderly people with memory
impairment. Developing pharmacotherapies that prolong the period of independence of elderly people with the
early stages of cognitive decline will have a significant impact. We have identified adropin, a small peptide that
is abundant in the brain, as a potential lead for developing drugs that delay aging-related cognitive decline.
Several lines of evidence suggest that low adropin activity in the brain predisposes to aging-related cognitive
decline and that increasing adropin activity would be beneficial. In humans, low circulating adropin levels are
predictive of cognitive decline in older adults. Moreover, in mouse studies, interventions that increase adropin
levels have been shown to protect against aging-related cognitive decline. However, gaps in knowledge on how
adropin acts at a cellular level are a barrier to developing drugs based on adropin. This proposal addresses this
barrier by developing an antisense-oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy to boost expression of the endogenous gene.
The central hypothesis tested by the proposal is that ASO which inhibit the interaction of the mRNA encoding
adropin (ENHO) with miR-29, a microRNA that inhibits expression, will increase adropin levels in brain. Based
on preclinical experiments using a transgenic mouse approach to prevent aging-related decline in adropin protein
levels, ASO that specifically target the interaction of miR-29 with ENHO will increase adropin activity and
significantly improve cognitive performance in aged mice. This exploratory proposal will identify ‘lead’ ASO
sequences targeting the ENHO-miR-29 interaction using cell-based assays and perform preclinical experiments
using old mice to demonstrate feasibility of the approach."

Background: Fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3 (FLT3) is the most commonly mutated gene in acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) and mutations in FLT3 are associated with high relapse rates. FLT3
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are clinically active in FLT3-mutant AML but duration of
response is limited by the development of resistance. Mutations in NRAS and other activation
of the RAS pathway are major mechanisms of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors and other AML
targeted therapies. Rationale: We have identified suppression of the Mediator/RNA Pol II
pathway augments FLT3 TKI-induced apoptosis in the setting of RAS activation. The overall
goals of this project are: (1) to prioritize therapeutic targets in the Mediator/RNA Pol II pathway;
and (2) to determine the essential Mediator/RNA Pol II-dependent transcriptional targets
relevant to FLT3 TKI resistance. Methods: We will identify essential components of the RNA Pol
II pathway needed for TKI resistance in AML and evaluate the efficacy of existing RNA Pol II
pathway inhibitors in MAPK-activated AML cells. We will determine RNA Pol II-dependent
transcriptional changes induced by MAPK activation and FLT3 inhibition in pre-clinical models
and patient samples. We will functionally validate the essential downstream transcriptional
targets critical to RAS-mediated FLT3 TKI resistance in AML. Expected Results: These studies
will rigorously evaluate RNA Pol II as a novel treatment strategy in AML with aberrant
RAS/MAPK signaling. If successful, this strategy can be quickly translated to clinical trials in
AML and this general approach may also prove efficacious in other RAS-mutant cancers."
10907022,"MIND-the-SKIN Project: Multi-functional Innovative Digital Toolkit for the Skin Diseases in LMICs and
Beyond
 The prevalence of skin diseases is extremely high in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in children. If left
untreated, some have debilitating lifelong physical disabilities and deformities, as well as social and mental
effects. Among them are skin infections which are listed as members of the Neglected Tropical Diseases
(NTDs) by the World Health Organization and targeted for disease control globally. Many of the NTDs,
including leprosy, Buruli ulcers, yaws, and lymphatic filariasis, are co-endemic in West Africa. Early detection
and treatment is currently the most effective measures for their disease control. However, this is hampered by
a paucity of skilled healthcare workers in the remote areas of the LMICs where they prevail. On the other hand,
diagnosis of these conditions can be done with patient history and simple skin examination, without undergoing
invasive examinations requiring special skills and equipment. This is very well suited to field settings in LMICs.
With a targeted training, technology-assisted decision-support system and a telemedicine network, local
healthcare workers could be leveraged to enhance the diagnosis and management of the skin conditions. This
project proposes to do so through development and validation of an mHealth tool for skin diseases in LMICs:
the ‘eSkinHealth’ application. It is a portable smartphone or tablet application that could provide: a) direct
diagnostic and management assistance to healthcare workers in remote setting, and through teledermatology,
b) storage of longitudinal patients records for improved follow-up, and c) organization of clinical and image data
of the skin. There is a general lack of good clinical photos of skin diseases on dark skin, and collection of
photos made through this project could be further used for development of photo guides for wide use and
future studies on dermatology of skin of color. The purpose of the proposed research is to complete
development and optimization of eSkinHealth and carry out its effectiveness studies on the field. The R21
phase of the work will assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of the prototype, validation of a novel
built-in wound scoring system, and standardization and optimization of dermatologic photography on dark skin.
The R33 phase will evaluate the performance of the app on outcomes of surveillance and management of
NTDs and further optimization of photo analysis of skin lesions on dark skin using the image optimization
technology. The research will be carried out in a western-African country of Côte d’Ivoire. It will build on our
previous work in surveillance of NTDs in rural Côte d’Ivoire and trainings to local healthcare workers, as well as
our expertise in mHealth. It will leverage our multi-year collaboration with investigators from Côte d’Ivoire,
application developers in Japan, and tropical medicine expertise from Tulane University. If successful,
eSkinHealth will be instrumental in overcoming the current gaps and weaknesses in dermatological services in
LMICs providing a breakthrough to management of skin diseases in this underserved populations, as well as
contributing to the dermatology of skin of color worldwide, envisioning Skin Health for All."

Recently we have discovered a group of drug-like small molecules that inhibit Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase 4
(CRL4). We have found that these molecules are toxic to a subset of leukemia cell lines, which express very
low levels of the CRL4 component cullin 4. Moreover, the CRL4 inhibitors exhibit anti-tumor activity in
experimental mice. These preliminary findings suggest an interesting possibility that some low-cullin 4-
expressing leukemia lines are vulnerable to our newly discovered CRL4 inhibitors and thus can be exploited for
selective cancer therapies.
In this project, we propose to improve CRL4 inhibitors using synthetic chemistry and to understand the
molecular basis of how the small molecule compounds act to inhibit CRL4. Finally, we will develop both cell-
and animal-based pre-clinical models to evaluate the anti-cancer potential for the CRL4 inhibitors against a
subset of leukemia that are characterized by low cullin 4 abundance. Such information is critical for developing
new strategy to improve the treatment of leukemia."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application to PA-14-190 (Epidemiology and Prevention in Alcohol Research (R01)) continues research to reduce college students' alcohol use and consequences (R01AA012547; Larimer PI). Development of efficacious college drinking interventions is an important public health priority. Personalized feedback interventions (PFI), delivered via mail, internet, cell-phone, and text messaging, have evidence of efficacy but effects are small and variable across time and outcomes. Remote PFI delivery increases reach, but introduces barriers to efficacy, particularly variable attention to and comprehension of material. PFIs with multiple components delivered simultaneously may be overwhelming or confusing. This is problematic, as highly personalized feedback interventions with more components may produce larger and longer effects. In contrast, short-term efficacy of single-component PFIs (e.g., normative feedback) has been established, and these simpler PFIs may have more immediate impact; however, duration has been variable. Research is needed to determine optimal delivery to capitalize on clarity and initial impact of single-component and greater effect size and duration of multi-component PFIs. Duration may also be impacted by fluctuations in drinking during high- risk events. Moreover, PFI effects may be attenuated by timing of assessments relative to important high-risk events (e.g., New Year's eve falling within assessment of past month drinking), as well as time elapsed between PFI and specific events and if the PFI addressed the high-risk event. Providing boosters to address high-risk events, assessing drinking during these events and on typical occasions, and evaluating impact of intervention and assessment timing relative to high-risk events may help explain inconsistent findings regarding PFI effect size and duration. The current study addresses these gaps through evaluating a multi- component online PFI with simultaneous delivery (all PFI components at once) versus a sequential format, wherein individual PFI components are delivered one at a time to minimize attention demands for each component. The study seeks to enhance magnitude and duration of effects through adding text-message- based boosters to address specific high-risk events during the year following intervention. We will assess event-specific and typical drinking and consequences to evaluate immediate and sustained (through 24 months) changes in mediators and outcomes. Participants (N=1000 heavy drinking students) will be recruited in 4 cohorts corresponding with each quarter of the calendar year, and randomly assigned in a 2 (simultaneous versus sequential PFI) x 2 (boosters or no boosters) +1 (Assessment Only Control) longitudinal RCT design. Specific aims are: 1)Evaluate efficacy, moderators, and mediators of multi-component PFI, comparing simultaneous vs. sequential delivery vs. AOC; 2) Evaluate impact, mediators, and moderators of event-specific boosters on outcomes for both typical and event-specific drinking; 3) Evaluate timing of high-risk events relative to time since initial PFI and timing of longitudinal follow-up assessments on intervention
efficacy."

Chemical modiﬁcation of RNA is a critical mechanism of gene expression regulation, controlling RNA
processing, stability, and, in the case of mRNA, translation. The chemical diversity of RNA modiﬁcations
suggests that there is extensive biology yet to be uncovered. A recent surge in this ﬁeld has been driven largely
by rapid advances in high throughput sequencing methods that allow us to map these marks on a
transcriptome-wide scale. However, the majority of studies remain correlative and are not able to reveal the
molecular mechanisms of RNA modiﬁcation function or regulation. The information we glean from such studies
often represents an average across all transcripts in the cell, and does not take into account the spatial
organization or temporal control of RNA transcription, processing, and trafﬁcking. Moreover, the majority of
work on mRNA modiﬁcations has focused on a single modiﬁcation, N6-methyladenosine (m6A), which
represents only one of over one hundred modiﬁcations annotated to date. Here we describe two research
directions in our laboratory that address fundamental questions about mRNA modiﬁcations. The ﬁrst research
direction aims to characterize a new mRNA modiﬁcation, N1-methyladenosine (m1A). Since discovering this
modiﬁcation in mRNA in during my postdoctoral work, technical challenges have prevented us from
understanding the functions and regulation of this mRNA modiﬁcation. These challenges have also led to
conﬂicting data and controversy over the presence and prevalence of m1A in mRNA. We have recently
validated new m1A mRNA sites and we are now well positioned to ﬁnally shed light on this mysterious mRNA
modiﬁcation. The second research direction aims to identify the mechanisms that coordinate cotranscriptional
modiﬁcation of mRNAs as they are being synthesized. This remains mysterious for even the most well-
characterized mRNA modiﬁcation, m6A. We hypothesize that RNA polymerase II complexes recruit RNA
modiﬁcation enzymes during transcription, akin to how splicing and processing factors are cotranscriptionally
recruited to nascent mRNA. Using detailed biochemistry and RNA labeling approaches, we will dissect the
mechanisms of cotranscriptional RNA methylation. To tackle challenges such as these, our lab identiﬁes
speciﬁc settings, essentially molecular model systems, that allow us to dissect the molecular mechanisms of
RNA modiﬁcation-mediated regulation of gene expression. Once we reveal the regulatory components and
principles that govern these speciﬁc systems, we then have a molecular foothold to determine how general or
speciﬁc these principles are, and in which contexts they apply. Our work will open up a new areas of RNA
biology and allow us to understand how defects in these mechanisms result in associated human diseases."
10885955,"Transplantation is a cure for end stage organ failure, yet achieving “one transplant for life” remains elusive for
many transplant recipients due to immunologic rejection. Studies in mouse and NHP models and patient
populations have consistently implicated memory CD8+ T cells as playing a causal role in mediating
immunosuppression-resistant allograft rejection. Thus, the identification of the molecular mechanisms that
regulate memory CD8+ T cells responses remains an important goal for immunotherapy in clinical
transplantation. Fc receptors, previously known only to be expressed on B cells and innate immune cells, can
fine-tune immune cell activation based on the balance of activating and inhibitory Fc receptor signaling, much
like T cell costimulatory and coinhibitory molecules. During the last funding cycle we identified that the
inhibitory receptor FcγRIIB is also expressed on a subset of multi-functional effector/ memory CD8+ T cells in
mice and in humans, and showed that FcγRIIB functionally regulates CD8+ T cell immunity in a cell-
autonomous manner in both mice and in a human clinical trial. However, the mechanisms by which this occurs
are still not clear. First, the signals via which FcγRIIB ligation leads to T cell death are not known. We
discovered that FcγRIIB signaling on CD8+ T cells is not controlled by antibody ligation, but instead by a novel
immunosuppressive cytokine fibrinogen-like 2 (Fgl2). Moreover, our additional preliminary data suggest a
FcγRIIB SHIP1-dependent mechanism that leads to the induction of apoptosis. Thus, in Aim 1, we will
determine the cellular source of Fgl2 that is critical for FcγRIIB-mediated CD8+ T cell apoptosis, and
will use a proteomics approach to elucidate the proximal intracellular signaling molecules that associate with
FcγRIIB to promote caspase 3/7 activity. Second, we made the novel observation that FcγRIIB+ CD8+ T cells
exhibit increased expression of the ganglioside metabolic enzyme Gm2a, and that increased expression of
Gm2a mRNA in CD8+ T cells is associated with stability on minimal immunosuppression in a cohort of human
renal transplant recipients. These preliminary data form the premise for the hypothesis to be tested in Aim 2:
that Gm2a is a novel regulatory pathway that regulates transplant acceptance, potentially in an FcγRIIB-
dependent fashion. Finally, in Aim 3 we propose to directly measure FcγRIIB, Fgl2, and Gm2a expression in
CD8+ T cells isolated from a validation cohort of human renal transplant recipients, and to determine the
association between CD8+ T cell FcγRIIB and Gm2a expression and reduced alloimmunity and/or acute
rejection. These data will allow us to determine the ability of FcγRIIB/Gm2a-expressing T cells to be used as a
predictive biomarker to stratify the risk of rejection following transplantation. In sum, through these mechanistic
and translational studies, we will elucidate the fundamental molecular and cellular pathways of FcγRIIB-
mediated inhibition of CD8+ T cell responses, and their therapeutic potential to attenuate memory CD8+ T cell
responses and improve outcomes in clinical transplantation."
10885987,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Infection with non-typhoidal Salmonella is 1 of 4 most prevalent global causes of diarrheal disease. In
the United States, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm) infection results in 1.35 million illnesses
annually. To infect the gastrointestinal tract, S. Tm contends with the resident commensal bacteria (gut
microbiota). The gut microbiota benefits the host by limiting enteric pathogen expansion (colonization
resistance), partially via the production of inhibitory metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) (e.g.,
propionate) and nutrient sequestration (e.g., amino acids). Thus, successful bacterial pathogens must possess
mechanisms to survive in the competitive ecosystem of the gut. S. Tm uses a Type III secretion system (T3SS-
I) to invade intestinal epithelial cells (EICs) and induce intestinal inflammation. As a result, S. Tm disrupts the
host-microbiota ecosystem and overcomes microbiota-mediated colonization resistance by using inflammation-
derived electron acceptors such as fumarate and nitrate for anaerobic respiration. However, the mechanisms
that drive Salmonella-induced disruption of the microbial ecosystem in the gut and how this disruption affects
host physiology and promotes pathogen expansion remain largely unknown. In this application, we will elucidate
the mechanisms by which S. Tm-induced intestinal inflammation enables the pathogen to (i) overpower SCFA-
mediated colonization resistance and (ii) gain access to microbiota-derived aspartate for anaerobic fumarate
respiration. Our robust preliminary data obtained from in vitro studies and murine models demonstrate that the
pathogen may use propionate metabolism to fine-tune virulence through modulation of T3SS-I expression. Our
studies further reveal that S. Tm-induced inflammation causes an increase in Bacteroides-derived aspartate in
the intestinal lumen and that aspartate conversion into fumarate fuels S. Tm fumarate respiration in vitro and in
vivo. Our preliminary data support our central hypothesis that pathogen-induced intestinal inflammation allows
S. Tm to overcome mechanisms of colonization resistance established by the microbiota by (i) downregulating
invasion of EICs via catabolism of Bacteroides-derived propionate and (ii) promoting the release of aspartate by
commensal Bacteroides, which S. Tm uses to outcompete commensal Enterobacteriaceae. To test this
hypothesis, we will define the impact of propionate catabolism on S. Tm pathogenesis in the inflamed gut (Aim
1). Aim 2 will identify the mechanism by which intestinal inflammation promotes increased aspartate availability
in the inflamed gut. In Aim 3, we will determine how aspartate enables S. Tm to overcome colonization resistance
by Enterobacteriaceae, a bacterium taxon that plays a critical role in protecting the host against S. Tm infection.
If successful, this research will establish critical conceptual advances in understanding how enteric pathogens
exploit the gut microbiota for expansion during gastroenteritis. Expected findings will provide a deeper
understanding of a novel mechanism used by this bacterial pathogen to evade the intestinal microbiota and
establish infection."

The current rapid pace of scientific discovery in cancer research, particularly in the areas of cancer genetics,
tumor biology, immunology and tumor microenvironment, offers unprecedented opportunities for rapid clinical
application of basic scientific findings. This progress will be optimized by providing rigorous basic and clinical
research training to a select group of surgical oncology trainees who are already directed towards academic
leadership. The Specific Aim of this program is to provide formal training in scientific thought and technique to
this highly select group of individuals. A total of six training slots are competitively awarded to trainees pursuing
highly sought-after subspecialty fellowship training in surgical oncology, as well as general surgery
residents committed to careers in cancer research. For this renewal application, six “faculty participating units”
will be formed and each is focused on the research training in one malignant disease field. The participating
unit is formed by a multidisciplinary group of senior faculty preceptors together with clinical faculty members
who will serve as co-mentors for our trainees. This structure is designed to position trainees to engage in
“team science”. In the current era of specialization in highly sophisticated areas of research, the optimal
structure for impactful contributions by surgeon scientists is through a team approach. The trainee selection
process is an interactive process involving both candidates of trainees and faculty members and will match the
most qualified applicants with the most suitable faculty members. Both internal and external candidates are
equally considered. Trainees will elect to enter either the Laboratory Research Track or the Clinical Research
Track. The training period is uninterrupted by clinical duties and includes formal training in research ethics as
well as additional mandatory course work tailored to individual interests and capabilities. The participating units
will guide each trainee in their units to form an Individual Advisory Committee, which will meet regularly to
critique the trainee's research, monitor their long-term progress towards an independent investigative career,
and aid in the selection of appropriate course work. In addition, training in the basic science research,
leadership, and grant writing will be required. The program has achieved outstanding success in the
recruitment of underrepresented minorities, owing to outstanding role models and broad representation of
women and minorities among our clinical trainees, as well as additional strategies outlined in this proposal.
Moreover, a formal evaluation of faculty and the program by trainees is implemented. Thus, in the renewal
application, the program is further strengthened to nourish a highly selected group of academic surgical
oncologists who will develop original and significant research programs and provide strong leadership within
the cancer research community."

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most common form of organ failure in sepsis and sepsis-induced AKI is
associated with prolonged hospitalization, need for acute dialysis, persistent AKI, and death. Despite this
public health impact, no effective pharmacotherapy exists for the treatment of sepsis -induced AKI. One
reason may be that heterogeneity is present within AKI, thereby concealing unique pathophysiologic processes
specific to certain AKI populations. The applicant is an early career investigator who has generated preliminary
data demonstrating that two novel AKI sub-phenotypes are present within the larger heterogeneous AKI clinical
population. Our group demonstrated that these AKI sub-phenotypes have differing risk for clinical outcomes
and response to vasopressin therapy, independent of traditional criteria to risk stratify AKI. We also identified a
3-variable model that included plasma markers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation to identify the two
AKI sub-phenotypes. These findings were subsequently replicated by an independent research group. Through
this body of work, we have consistently shown in sepsis-induced AKI that these two AKI sub-phenotypes are
reproducible, prognostic and predictive. Important next steps for translating these findings to the bedside
include: 1) expanding the pool of candidate biomarkers to identify these or alternative AKI sub-phenotypes in
the emergency room (ER), an earlier and critical time to implement strategies to prevent or treat AKI; 2)
evaluating response of AKI sub-phenotypes to volume of intravenous fluids, a therapy given to almost all
patients with sepsis-induced AKI; and 3) probing whether the AKI sub-phenotypes different in terms of
pathophysiologic mechanisms. We will complete the proposed Aims in two ongoing NIH-funded studies, 1)
Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressor Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS) and 2) Kidney Precision Medicine
Project (KPMP).
In Aim 1, we will identify sepsis-induced AKI sub-phenotypes using biospecimens collected in the ER and
determine associations with clinical outcomes in CLOVERS. We will apply two innovative approaches to
identify AKI sub-phenotypes (an unsupervised clustering and a previously developed 3-variable model).
In Aim 2, we will determine whether sepsis-induced AKI sub-phenotypes respond differently to a restrictive
fluid/early vasopressor versus a liberal fluid/late vasopressor resuscitation strategy.
In Aim 3, we will identify histological lesions from kidney biopsy tissue and urinary proteins associated with
sepsis-induced AKI sub-phenotypes in biospecimens collected during AKI in KPMP.
The outstanding qualifications of our team in the field of AKI, sepsis, molecular epidemiology, and
interventional clinical trials uniquely position us to align clinical care with underlying molecular mechanisms to
inform a ‘precision’ approach to the study and care of patients with sepsis-induced AKI."
10886006,"Prosthetic sockets are secured to the residual limb by a variety of suspension techniques, including
mechanical (straps, pin locking liners) and suction (sealing sleeves, one-way valves, vacuum pumps) systems.
Evidence strongly suggests the benefit of vacuum-assisted suspension (VAS) over other suspension
techniques, including: reducing residual limb volume fluctuations that compromise socket fit, improving gait
symmetry, reducing relative motion between the residual limb and socket, facilitating healing of residual limb
wounds, and application to prosthesis users with short residual limbs. Commercial pump designs are either
mechanical or electrical, each having unique advantages and disadvantages. The Hybrid Integrated Pump
Project Initiative (HIPPI) began in 2010 as part of a Department of Defense funded project and resulted in the
design of pump technology that incorporates electrical and mechanical systems to achieve VAS irrespective of
the state of the user while maximizing battery life and minimizing noise. The HIPPI technology underwent
preliminary evaluation demonstrating feasibility but highlighting the need for additional enhancements. The
purpose of this project is to further design and evaluate the HIPPI system and enhance commercial-viability to
attract industry partners with whom to generate a market-ready device through future collaborative efforts. This
device would have considerable value for the Veterans Health Administration by offering technology that would
apply to active patients who desire rapid generation of VAS with minimal battery recharging, and older patients
who rely on sustained VAS without the need to continuously load their prosthesis.
While our design has attracted interest from multiple prosthetics manufacturers, design improvements must be
made to enhance commercial-viability and ensure efficacy of use in persons with amputation. These needs will
be addressed through the development activities of this work including stage-gate design processes, bench
and human subject testing, and input from stakeholders. We plan to refine the hybrid electrical-mechanical
vacuum pump design by: 1) optimizing the mechanical pump system to ensure generation of a maximum level
of vacuum comparable to existing vacuum pumps, and 2) seamlessly integrating a microprocessor-controlled
electrical pump system to monitor vacuum level and reengage the system when pressure falls below a set
minimum. During the design process, industrial design and user-centered market research will be conducted
through stakeholder focus groups and consultation with an industrial designer and our industry partner to
enhance commercial viability. Each iterative prototype of the HIPPI system will undergo bench and human
subject testing. The electrical system will be bench tested to quantify the time and rate by which the system
achieves the minimum-required vacuum level in a sealed volume, and verify that the microprocessor
recognizes when the level falls below a predefined value and activates to reestablish that level. The
mechanical system will be bench tested to quantify the number of cycles to achieve sufficient vacuum level and
verify that the device satisfies structural ISO 10328 standards (static strength and durability). A prototype will
also be assessed on individuals with below-knee and above-knee limb loss in the laboratory to verify that the
pump can achieve and sustain sufficient vacuum level between the prosthetic liner and socket during walking
but does not considerably alter socket reaction moments. The deliverable from this project will be a refined and
working HIPPI prototype that will be applicable to Veteran users of VAS irrespective of their age, gender, or
activity level. The results of this work will position us well to transfer this technology to a commercial partner
and engage with them in competitive research proposals to continue commercialization efforts and evaluate
clinical efficacy in large-scale VA clinical studies."

Nurses/Coordinators within the Clinical Research Groups (CRGs), the CPDM works closely with the CRGs to
manage a robust cancer clinical trial portfolio that prioritizes institutional and externally peer-reviewed trials,
and complements the SKCCC patient catchment area. The CPDM has three operational sections, each
supervised by a manager: Operations, Compliance and the Coordinating Center. Administration of the CPDM
is the responsibility of the CPDM Director and the Associate Director for Clinical Research. The Operations
group supports 250 investigators and oversees 467 interventional and 296 non-interventional studies, all of
which are stored and tracked through a centralized repository that contributes to the efficient flow of protocol-
related data in a system-wide integrated approach. From 2016–2020, 8,234 accruals to interventional trials
(7.5% increase over 2011–2015) were managed, representing 26% of our annual registry cases. Of the
accruals, 68% were to therapeutic trials. CPDM QA group reviewed 108 studies with a total of 141 reviews,
oversaw 100 Investigational New Drug applications, and provided ongoing education and guidance. The
Coordinating Center managed 29 multisite trials with 132 external sites. The CRGs, led by faculty CRG
Directors and Managers, unite research staff around their multidisciplinary disease focus to conduct clinical
research. The CPDM supports committees that promote quality review, engage faculty and staff in operational
efficiency, and lead forums that disseminate improvements. The CPDM provides various educational series, ad
hoc sessions and onboarding for new faculty, fellows and staff. The CPDM administratively supports the
independent Protocol Review and Monitoring System and the Safety Monitoring Committee. An institutional
Data Safety Monitoring Board reviews all randomized clinical studies and high-risk institutional and externally
peer-reviewed studies. Inclusion of women and minorities in SKCCC clinical trials remains a major focus of
leadership and faculty members. The Assistant Director for Diversity and Inclusion works with the Office of
Community Outreach and Engagement and the CPDM to collect and analyze accrual data, develop SOPs to
improve accrual, and promote cultural humility in recruitment and retention practices. Minority inclusion
consistently matches the diversity of the individuals seeking care at the SKCCC. An additional 193 African

The Research Resources Core (RRC) will support the overarching objective of the CAPRA to accelerate and
expand multidisciplinary population-based AD/ADRD research by the development of robust research
resources. This core will be dedicated to advancing large population-based research using a variety of rich
secondary data sources in order to uncover and shed light on the complex and intertwined social, economic,
and health systems effects of AD/ADRD. However, undertaking such analyses requires that researchers
understand and surmount specific challenges, including: identifying relevant cohorts of older adults with
demonstrated cognitive decline and/or dementia; monitoring short-term and long-term outcomes; and
appreciating the local care-delivery environment. Through this core, we will package, create, and facilitate
access to databases that help researchers identify relevant cohorts, outcomes of interest, and community
factors—to help lower the barriers to their entry to the AD/ADRD research community. Data sources for
AD/ADRD research that will be leveraged include Medicare administrative and assessment data, the Health
and Retirement Study, the Michigan Long-term Services & Supports Data Archive and relevant publicly
available population-based national health surveys. Research-identifiable Medicare and assessment data is
both expensive to acquire and requires considerable analyst training; therefore, research with such data are
often out-of-reach for researchers. However, simply facilitating access for researchers to Medicare and other
large, complex health and healthcare datasets is not sufficient to ensure researchers can conduct rigorous and
impactful research, particularly among early stage researchers or those new to AD/ADRD research. In this
core, we will lower barriers and make high-quality data functionally accessible to AD/ADRD researchers by
providing training products, aggregate data, and algorithms relevant to the field. In doing so, the RRC will also
develop and disseminate a series of innovative research training activities, including the Current Topics in
Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease Research podcast & blog (the “CAPRAcast”) and a webinar series devoted
to training AD/ADRD researchers (the “CAPRAclass”). We will leverage the expansive, multidisciplinary
AD/ADRD research expertise at the University of Michigan and partnered external collaborators to develop
resources necessary to support a wide array of AD/ADRD research. The RRC will support and foster
multidisciplinary, population-based AD/ADRD research by the development of rigorous AD/ADRD-specific
training, the creation and dissemination of research tools, and the provision of access to high-quality data. In
this way the core will work synergistically with the other CAPRA cores by providing robust AD/ADRD research
resources and training that support the overarching center aims."

 The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) provides rigorous scientific review of all human
subjects cancer clinical research within the institution, including affiliate sites. The PRMS is responsible for
reviewing each research protocol for scientific merit, biostatistical design, accrual estimates, priority within the
Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) disease-/modality-focused Clinical Research Groups
(CRGs) and SKCCC, and progress over time. The PRMS accomplishes its charge through a two-stage review
process. The first stage includes initial review and prioritization of each trial concept by the CRGs. It is followed
by review by a sub-committee of the PRMS Clinical Research Committee (PRMS-CRC), representing Center-
wide Shared Resources, to evaluate and provide feedback on feasibility and identify areas of concern to be
addressed by the study team before the second stage of review. CRGs are multidisciplinary groups of
investigators and research staff, led by designated faculty leaders and assisted by Center-supported CRG
Managers. CRGs track studies that are not prioritized to move further and those that move to the second
stage. Criteria for review within CRGs include scientific priority, clinical need, protocol leadership, needs of the
catchment area and funding source. The second stage of PRMS review includes the scientific and biostatistical
review of every cancer-related clinical trial protocol by the PRMS-CRC. The PRMS-CRC receives CRG input
on proper prioritization of new and existing protocols. PRMS-CRC Members serve two-year, renewable terms
and are appointed by the SKCCC Director. They reflect the scientific Research Programs and CRGs in the
Center with representation from biostatistics, pathology, translational labs, patient advocacy and population/
behavioral science. The committee has the authority to approve protocols for Institutional Review Board review
that meet the scientific merit and priorities of the SKCCC, and to close protocols that have not demonstrated
adequate scientific progress. The PRMS-CRC has a dedicated PRMS Manager. Working with the Clinical
Protocol and Data Management Office, initiatives to monitor and improve protocol activation timelines largely
reduced the median activation time to 111 days in 2020. There are ongoing efforts to maintain awareness of
the importance of inclusion of women, minorities and individuals across the life span in clinical research. These
efforts are operational and effective with minority inclusion, consistently aligning with minority representation
seen at the SKCCC. Of the 283 studies triaged by CRGs during CY2020, 111 interventional trials were

 The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) Flow/Mass Cytometry Shared Resource
(SR) has continuously offered state-of-the-art cell sorting and flow analysis services to SKCCC Members from
its inception in 1980. In 2013, the Flow Cytometry SR merged with the Human Immunology (HI) SR, but HI has
since been more appropriately integrated with a newly established SR that handles clinical specimen
collections and processing for all SKCCC studies. To expand the capabilities for tumor microenvironment and
immune profiling, the SKCCC recently acquired mass cytometry technologies for suspension and imaging
analyses. These resources were integrated into the collective Flow/Mass Cytometry and Technology
Development (FCTD) Shared Resource (SR) in 2020. While many diverse therapies are being evaluated at the
SKCCC, many studies overlap in their requirement for flow/mass cytometry analysis and cell sorting of immune
cells. These services are provided in a timely, flexible and affordable manner to SKCCC Members from across
the medical campus. Services provided by the FCTD SR do not duplicate services available elsewhere, and
the SR currently operates the only mass cytometer at the institution. Cytometry services range from basic two-
color flow analyses to complex cell-sorting experiments involving up to 16 colors, as well as 20-plex mass
cytometry profiling based on 30-40+ parameters, plus training, data analysis and consultation services.
Successful execution of these services has led to: 1) a novel analytical pipeline for determining T cell repertoire
changes in response to immunotherapy regimens (i.e., the Mutation-Associated Neoantigen Functional
Expansion of Specific T Cells Assay), 2) synergistic incorporation of multimer-based methodologies for
investigating neoantigen-specific T cell subpopulations, and 3) a platform for innovative integration of
scRNAseq datasets to study T cell responses in collaboration with the SKCCC Experimental and
Computational Genomics SR. Moreover, the application of mass cytometry techniques, as currently offered by
the FCTD SR, has already enabled discovery for preclinical and translational researchers at the SKCCC.
Collectively, these resources significantly improve the ability to functionally characterize immune cells in cancer
therapy, vaccine trials and preclinical studies.

 The Experimental and Computational Genomics (ECGC) Shared Resource (SR) integrates all of the
cancer genomics services in the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC). The primary
mission of the SR is to allow SKCCC investigators to harness the ongoing revolution in cancer genomics to
accelerate their basic discoveries and translational research. The ECGC SR streamlined services that were
previously offered through three separate SRs: Array, Next-Generation Sequencing and Bioinformatics. The
current structure formalizes a long-standing commitment to integrate computing resources, hiring and
educational activities for the common good of the SKCCC. The SR streamlined access to ECGC technologies
and expertise, and enhanced opportunities for didactic and hands-on education in the experimental and
computational aspects of cancer genomics. The immense laboratory and analytical expertise brought together
in the newly integrated cross-disciplinary SR is now available to all SKCCC investigators. The full suite of
services provided by this SR are not available elsewhere. The ECGC SR has developed a three-tiered
approach to streamline effective project delivery. This SR is led by faculty directors Leslie Cope, Ph.D.; Sarah
Wheelan, M.D., Ph.D.; and Srinavasan Yegnasubramanian, M.D., Ph.D., who bring together multidisciplinary
expertise in genomics technologies, computational biology and biostatistics/bioinformatics. Project
management and day-to-day operations are overseen by Kornel Schuebel, Ph.D., on the lab side and by Yan
Zhang, Ph.D., a new recruit, on the computational side, who supervise all staff members. The ECGC SR
provides access to and education in state-of-the-art, next-generation sequencing, microarray technologies and
analytical workflows for probing genomic alterations, cancer epigenomics, transcriptomics and metagenomics.
For each project, the SR uses a multidisciplinary clinical model to establish and execute an experimental and
analytical plan, first meeting with each investigator and then helping them through all aspects of their genomics
experiments, including experimental design, high-throughput microarray or next-generation sequencing
workflows, and computational/bioinformatics data analysis. Additionally, the SR provides extensive educational
resources, including short courses, workshops and symposia, so that investigators can gain the skills they
need to fully understand and utilize the data and analyses generated. The success of the ECGC SR is
evidenced by the high level of usage across all Programs and the cited support in a large number of impactful
publications, national/international conference abstracts and successful grant applications.

(CFI) Shared Resource (SR) is to provide comprehensive preclinical molecular and functional imaging
infrastructure and expertise in multimodality imaging of cancer to support the preclinical imaging research
needs of Center members. The original facility in the Miller Research Building houses a 9.4T MRI/S scanner
for magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy, an intravital Olympus multiphoton microscope with in vivo
imaging capability, a SuperArgus PET-CT scanner, a Vector SPECT scanner, and a Gamma Medica SPECT-
CT scanner for nuclear imaging, optical imaging scanners (including an IVIS Spectrum and an LI COR near
infrared scanner) and an ultrasound scanner. A state-of-the-art satellite facility in the SKCCC Cancer Research
Building II (CRBII) in the lower basement opened in 2019 to house a simultaneous preclinical 7T PET-MR
scanner. A photoacoustic imaging scanner, operational since November 2020, was also installed in CRBII-
LB03 through an NIH High-End Instrument award. The CRBII-LB03 facility has allowed a much-needed
expansion with new imaging equipment to maintain this SR as a state-of-the-art facility. It also is in close
proximity to the newly installed mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) Rapiflex MALDI TOF/TOF scanner of the
Mass Spectrometry Molecular Imaging and Multi-Omics SR, allowing investigation of the relationship between
the in vivo imaging data and information provided by MSI. Because many of the imaging techniques are
translatable to humans, imaging data generated through this SR can be used to develop translational
applications in humans.

10887461,"Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder that effects 1% of the population, with an additional 2-3%
developing a schizoaffective disorder. SCZ patients exhibit a spectrum of cognitive deficits including defective
episodic memory, present prior to the onset of psychosis and frequently expressed in relatives of affected
individuals. Episodic memory formation is dictated in part by spatially tuned (place cell) activity of principal
cells in the hippocampus. The biological mechanisms driving this learning capacity in the healthy hippocampus
remain largely unknown, let alone their disruption in schizophrenia, leaving large gaps in our knowledge that
need to be addressed. Using in vivo functional imaging in mouse dorsal hippocampal area CA1 during head-fixed
during learning behaviors, we recently uncovered specific alterations in in vivo physiological properties of CA1
pyramidal cells in the Df(16)A+/− transgenic mouse model of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, the largest known
genetic risk to develop SCZ. Df(16)A+/− CA1 place cells exhibit reduced long-term stability, impaired context-
related and lack of reward-related reorganization. A novel form of synaptic plasticity, termed behavioral time-
scale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), has been found to drive rapid formation of spatially selective firing fields in CA1
pyramidal cells; notably, our preliminary studies suggest that this form of plasticity is dysregulated in Df(16)A+/−
mice. We thus hypothesize that BTSP, a major form of plasticity that drives place cell-recruitment during
learning, is disrupted by SCZ risk mutations. These findings at the neuronal population level provide entry points
for dissecting the underlying cellular, molecular and microcircuit dysfunctions caused by schizophrenia risk
mutations. To gain these mechanistic insights we will unite the complementary expertise of the Losonczy lab and
the Gogos lab in etiologically valid genetic mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders to carry out multiscale
dissection of microcircuit, cellular and molecular pathophysiology of schizophrenia-related memory deficits in
the adult mouse hippocampal CA1 circuitry. Aim 1 is aimed at assessing altered synaptic plasticity in CA1
pyramidal cells during episodic learning in Df(16)A+/− mice. Aim 2 deals with dissecting inhibitory microcircuit
dynamics during episodic learning, while Aim 3 is focused at dissecting altered excitatory and neuromodulatory
input dynamics to CA1 during episodic learning in Df(16)A+/− mice. Taken together, Aims 1-3 provide a tractable

Mingrui Yang, PhD, is a biomedical imaging research scientist with quantitative background whose overarching
goal is to conduct clinically oriented multidisciplinary research to improve the understanding, diagnosis, and
treatment of musculoskeletal and other disorders through non-invasive medical imaging and quantitative
methods such as machine learning. The study he proposes entitled Automated Arthroscopic Partial
Meniscectomy using Deep Learning aims to develop automated systems for knee articular cartilage and
meniscus segmentation and abnormality detection based on cutting-edge deep-learning models, as well as one-
year patient outcome prediction after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) when physical therapy fails,
utilizing MR imaging biomarkers identified by the deep-learning models.
Candidate: Dr. Yang is a junior faculty member in the Program of Advanced Musculoskeletal Imaging (PAMI) of
the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Cleveland Clinic. His training has been focused on quantitative
sciences including mathematics, statistics, computer science, and technical development of magnetic resonance
(MR) imaging. He aims to transition to clinically research in osteoarthritis (OA) and medical imaging. The
proposed career development plan consists of four training goals to compel him toward an independent
investigator: 1) Gain knowledge in knee OA and the role of APM in knee OA; 2) Gain an understanding of
orthopaedic surgery, patient cohort, and clinical patient outcomes; 3) Gain an understanding of MR imaging
biomarkers for knee OA and APM outcomes; 4) Gain expertise in clinical research.
Environment: Dr. Yang and his primary mentor, Xiaojuan Li, PhD, have assembled a prominent team to guide
Dr. Yang’s training and research plans. As a member of PAMI, he will work closely with researchers and clinicians
in departments of Biomedical Engineering, Orthopaedics, and Diagnosis Imaging for his career development.
Research: The proposed study will be carried out in three phases corresponding to the three aims: Aim 1 builds
a deep learning system for automatic high-grade articular cartilage lesion detection on heterogeneous clinical
knee MR images; Aim 2 develops an automated deep learning system to detect the presence of meniscal root
tears on heterogeneous clinical knee MR images; Aim 3 utilizes the imaging finding(s) from the deep learning
system(s) and patient demographics to predict the clinical outcomes after APM.
Summary: The proposal will provide a novel, automated, and consistent tool for cartilage and meniscus
segmentation and lesion detection on heterogeneous knee MR images collected from clinical routine practice. A
prediction model using these imaging findings with patient demographics can help predict clinical outcomes for
patients undergoing APM surgery. This proposal will also advance Dr. Yang’s career development toward an
independent investigator in OA and biomedical imaging research."

 Many falls in nursing facilities are not reported during night when older adults are alone. It can lead to
reduced quality of life, increased fear of falling and restriction of activities, decreased ability to function, and
increased risk of injuries or death. We propose WARE-Care: mmWave based fall Assessment and
pRevEntion, as a non-intrusive system to work during the night to collect and assess older adults’ falling data.
WARE-Care will provide an accurate measurement of movement and be compact and easy to set up. The
system is safe, private, and user-friendly for nursing facility applications. The system is of strong interest to the
nursing centers, including the local Handmaker Jewish Services For Aging center.
 The WARE-Care system is novel and unique and is based on the PI’s developments in mmWave radar
combined with advanced machine learning techniques. The new field of mmWave radar opens opportunities
for elders monitoring with significant advantages that complement existing visual and body-worn sensors.
mmWave radar operates in all lighting conditions and generates a point cloud that can be used to accurately
create a skeleton while respecting privacy, e.g. no detailed facial information will be collected. The non-touch,
non-obtrusive sensor can be preferred to battery limited and potentially irritating body worn sensors during
sleeping hours for elders. We will first build and verify the proposed system in different rooms including a
typical restroom and bedroom in the nursing home. We will then apply new neural-network based methods to
recover accurate skeleton movement and detect abnormal behavior of people regardless of age, sex, weight,
or height. We will first recruit a group of healthy adults (18 or older) for setting up and training the proposed
system. The system will further be validated on a targeted older group (65 and older), and be compared with
wearable motion sensors. An interdisciplinary team has been assembled to develop and perform initial clinical
validation of this novel system."

Disease Progression
Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder that poses extensive challenges
to patients, families, and healthcare systems. Existing treatments are limited by an insufficient
understanding of the basic biology underlying disease development. The most prominent risk factor for
dementia and AD is aging and obesity, suggesting that chronic conditions may represent significant
contributors to AD pathogenesis. Cellular senescence, a cellular state characterized by permanent cell
cycle arrest, is induced by external stressors. Senescent cells produce various bioactive molecules,
known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors, which can influence the local
tissue microenvironment and promote systemic inflammation. SASP factors can have far-reaching
impacts, with endocrine-like systemic effects, and reducing senescent cell accumulation has been
found to have beneficial effects, leading researchers to further explore the roles played by senescent
cells in age-related disease pathogenesis. Preliminary studies suggest a potential link between the
accumulation of senescent cells in adipose tissue and brain dysfunction, implying that senescent cells
in adipose tissue may contribute to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration via endocrine effects. We
hypothesize that the aging- or obesity-driven accumulation of adipose senescent cells
contributes to cognitive deficits and neurodegeneration, including AD-related dysfunction,
through endocrine effects. We propose to determine the potential roles played by adipose SnCs on
microglial senescence, potentially contributing to cognitive decline and Alzheimer's progression, in
mouse models of aging, obesity, and AD. Our novel Adipoq-INK-ATTAC mouse model will enable the
targeted depletion of senescent cells from adipose tissue to further assess the roles played by these
cells in aging, obesity, and AD pathology. These investigations will allow us to ascertain whether
peripheral senescent cells represent potential novel therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative
disorders, particularly AD, aiding the development of future intervention strategies."

Persistent, and quite pervasive, racial disparities have been found between Black, autistic children and their
White, autistic peers. These disparities range from notable inequities in the timeliness of diagnosis to receipt of
substandard services to their under-representation in research studies. While key disparities have been
documented, there is a need for increased attention on potential underlying drivers of these disparities that are
rooted in the Black experience. We know from existing research on Black health and wellness that racism is
linked to some poorer physical and mental health outcomes. Our team will examine the impact of racism and
resulting racial trauma on the mental health outcomes of Black parents of autistic children (ages 3 -9) as well
as the downstream consequences that parental racial trauma has on child behavior and development. Using a
mixed method, cross-sectional study design, we will recruit an economically heterogeneous sample of 300
Black parents / caregivers of autistic children in the states of NC and PA. We will also use a community-
partnered participatory framework to tell the whole story of Black risk and resilience by focusing on both racial
trauma as well as Black cultural capital and assets. Therefore, the specific aims of this project are: Aim 1:
Understand the impact of racism (i.e., everyday racism and racialized trauma) on the well-being (i.e., quality of
life, stress, caregiver strain) of Black parents of autistic children. Aim 2: Examine whether parents’ experiences
with racialized trauma adversely affects child behaviors and development. Aim 3: Determine cultural capital
factors that moderate the impact on racism on parental well-being. Exploratory Aim 4: Using moderated
moderation analysis, explore whether cultural capital factors and parental well-being both moderate the impact
of racism on child behaviors and development. We further seek to understand how Black parents of autistic
children support their children’s racial pride and acceptance.
This team is ideally suited to tackle the complex topics and intersectional identities associated with race and
disability. We bring relevant and culturally informed content and methodological expertise. Further, our work is
being conducted in partnership with the Color of Autism organization, a national organization designed to
support and empower Black families. Through this work, we will gain key insight and knowledge of how the
Black experience impacts rearing an autistic child of color to provide more specificity and direction for future
tailored intervention approaches. This research is likely to exert a significant and immediate impact on the field
because it examines both the risk and resilience of a historically marginalized and excluded group."

Fundamental analysis of the mechanisms of leukemogenesis is required in order to develop optimized
treatment approaches. N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant RNA modification, plays key roles in
RNA metabolism, transcript stability, and translation efficiency. Aberrant regulation of m6A writers and erasers
contributes to leukemogenesis, though the exact mechanisms how the methyltransferase machinery is altered
in leukemia remains to be shown. Mutations in methyltransferase writers have not been identified to date, with
one exception: in the recurrent t(1;22) translocation in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) a component
of the m6A writer machinery, RBM15, is fused with MKL1, a transcriptional cofactor of serum response factor
(SRF). Understanding the mechanism by which the RBM15-MKL1 (RM) fusion protein causes leukemia will shed
light on the role of disordered m6A RNA methylation in leukemogenesis, specifically AMKL but also AML and to
cancer in general. We hypothesize that for RM-associated AMKL to develop, the MKL1 domain aberrantly targets
RBM15 activity to sites of SRF binding and that RBM15 recruits the m6A writer complex to associated RNAs,
altering m6A mRNA methylation and expression of genes that are required for transformation and/or are
important for megakaryocyte fate commitment and maturation. We propose focused, unbiased genome-wide
studies to determine how the m6A epitranscriptome and the SRF transcriptional networks are coopted in RBM15-
MKL1 AMKL. The functional effects of candidate target genes common to the genomic approaches (m6A RNA
immunoprecipitation, chromatin mapping, RNA stability assays, and mapping of the translatome) as well as the
relevance of critical domains in RM-mediated leukemogenesis will be tested with assays of growth, differentiation
and oncogene dependence in RM-induced murine AMKL as well as primary human AMKL patient derived
xenotransplants (PDX). The studies are highly clinically relevant as they address a unique mechanism causative
of AMKL via comprehensive analysis of fundamental biologic mechanisms, and will reveal previously unidentified
regulation of the epitranscriptome that may be a novel shared oncogenic mechanism in AML and other cancers.
The proposed approaches are multifaceted, using cell lines as well as genetically engineered animal models,
and primary human and murine leukemia samples. The studies will contribute to our understanding of
leukemogenesis by elucidating the direct role of a component of the m6A RNA methylase complex in leukemia
shedding light on the broader role of m6A mRNA modifications in AML."

on our promising preliminary screening that has identified type II compounds with therapeutic and prophylactic

scaffolds that act on multiple stages of parasite development. To achieve this goal, we propose to pursue the
following: (1) Design and synthesize optimized selective antimalarial type II compounds for in vivo application;
antiplasmodial hits will be optimized to improve potency, selectivity, and pharmacological properties through
stages of iterative analog design, synthesis, and evaluation of biological and biochemical activities. (2)
Determine rate of killing, resistance profile, stage susceptibility, and efficacy of lead compounds in murine and

10873953,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR) in tumor cells accelerates the development of resistance to
chemo- and radiotherapy and leads to the recurrence of disease. Hence, inducing HR deficiency in HR-proficient
tumors is a promising strategy to increase the efficacy of DNA-targeted therapies. Yet, we still do not know which
stage of the HR reaction is the most sensitive to inhibition and consequently the most promising to target.
However, inhibition of HR pathway intermediates during synapsis and strand invasion may be particularly
effective.
 The long-term goal of our study is to lay the groundwork for the development of novel HR-directed anti-
cancer therapeutics. The central hypothesis of our project is that human cells have evolved multiple pathways
of strand invasion. The rationale for this project is that a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of
the multiple pathways of strand invasion is likely to offer a strong scientific framework whereby new strategies to
cancer therapy can be developed. The overall objectives in this application are to (i) elucidate the molecular
mechanisms of the multiple pathways of strand invasion in HR in human cells, and (ii) determine the steps in
these pathways in which the HR functions of the RAD51 activators RAD51AP1, RAD54L, and RAD54B intersect.
The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Dissect the non-epistatic and epistatic
relationships between RAD51AP1, RAD54L, and RAD54B; and 2) Determine the functional roles of the
RAD51AP1-RAD54L and RAD51AP1-RAD54B protein complexes. Under the first aim, isogenic human cancer
cell lines will be used to determine the phenotypic consequences of RAD51AP1, RAD54L and/or RAD54B
deletion. Proven knockout strategies and assays to evaluate the effect that loss-of-function has on cytotoxicity,
genome stability, replication and recombination will be employed. For the second aim, biochemical assays of
strand invasion utilizing nucleosome-free and nucleosome-containing DNA substrates will be carried out, and
mutants defective in protein complex formation will be tested for complementation in cell survival assays.
 The research proposed in this application is innovative in the applicant’s opinion, because it focuses on
unraveling the poorly understood interplay between the multiple pathways of strand invasion that exist in human
cells, the intra-pathway synthetic interaction between RAD51AP1 and RAD54L, and the role of human RAD54B
in HR. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide strong scientific justification for the
continued development of inhibitors that target HR stimulators of strand invasion. The knowledge gained herein
also has the potential of offering new opportunities for the development of novel cancer therapies."
10874315,"Abstract (The Administrative Core)
Living alone has become increasingly common over the past few decades among older adults, including
those with cognitive decline (defined as subjective cognitive decline [SCD], mild cognitive decline [MCI], or
ADRD). Although living alone is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and
related dementias (ADRD),3 how living alone affects AD, particularly among African and Hispanic Americans
who are disproportionately affected by AD, remains poorly understood. Recent evidence indicates that
behavior and lifestyle interventions may prevent 30-40% of ADRD cases, improve cognitive and functional
symptoms of AD, and enhance quality of life (QoL). However, the uptake of these interventions remains low
in real life, due to failure in targeting Mechanisms of Behavior Change (MoBC). Moreover, older adults living
alone with cognitive decline, particularly those susceptible to health inequity, were often excluded by clinical
trials. Encouragingly, these issues could be addressed by technology, e.g., artificial intelligence and
wearable devices which older adults living alone with cognitive decline can feasibly access and use
technology. The strategic vision of the Arizona State University Roybal Center for Older Adults Living Alone
with Cognitive Decline (ASU Roybal) is to support MoBC-driven, technology-enabled intervention research to
address the needs of older adults living alone with cognitive decline by integrating the NIH’s Stage Model,
MoBC, Symptom Science Model, and NIA’s Health Disparities Research Framework. The goal of the
Administrative Core is to develop infrastructure, administer clinical trials, and evaluate and sustain ASU
Roybal’s long-term impact. The Administrative Core will be co-led by Ross Andel (lifestyle risk for ADRD)
and David W. Coon (Technology-enabled AD interventions). Andel and Coon have had extensive
administrative experience and will leverage rich expertise (e.g., gerontology, epidemiology, and technology)
within one of the most progressive institutions of higher education in the U.S. The specific aims are to 1)
establish the infrastructure to develop and advance clinical trials of MoBC-driven, technology-enabled
interventions for older adults living alone with cognitive decline; 2) champion the Center’s scientific activities,
including administering 12 trials of MoBC-driven, technology-enabled interventions in older adults living
alone with cognitive decline and coordinating data-sharing and enrichment programs; 3) develop the
evaluation metrics of success through formative and summative processes to continually evaluate and
improve the functioning of ASU Roybal; and 4) develop and carry out the sustainability plan to produce long-
term impact on preventing ADRD and improving QoL among older adults living alone with cognitive decline.
The Administrative Core is innovative in supporting the vision of ASU Roybal to develop scientists and
studies for older adults living alone with cognitive decline, critical recruitment resources, enrichment
activities, and a data repository for secondary data analyses with long-term impacts."
10874316,"Abstract (The Behavioral Intervention Development [BID] Core)
Behavior and lifestyle Interventions have shown promising effects on cognition, functional status, and quality of
life (QoL) in older adults with cognitive decline (defined as subjective cognitive decline [SCD], mild cognitive
impairment [MCI], or Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias [ADRD]). However, these interventions have
not been translated to make successful real-life impacts in older adults living alone with cognitive decline,
which is attributable to multifaceted reasons such as not targeting Mechanisms of Behavior Change (MoBC)
and being excluded by clinical trials if caregivers were not available. These barriers could be overcome with
technology, e.g., artificial intelligence and wearable devices that improved intervention uptake in older adults,
including those with cognitive decline and reach health disparity-susceptible populations that are
disproportionately affected by ADRD (e.g., African and Hispanic Americans). Hence, the goal of the Arizona
State University Roybal Center for Older Adults Living Alone with Cognitive Decline (ASU Roybal) is to develop
infrastructure and conduct clinical trials of MoBC-driven, technology-enabled interventions to delay ADRD and
improve QoL in older adults living alone with cognitive decline. The goals of the BID Core are to support the
conduct of 12 clinical trials of MoBC-driven, technology-enabled interventions for behavior and lifestyle change
in older adults living alone with cognitive decline and their advancement to the next stage of the NIH’s Stage
Model. Trial Investigators will engage in clinical trials aimed at applying digital technologies to modify MoBC
and/or biological targets for behavior and lifestyle change to improve proximal and long-term outcomes. For
example, Trial 1 (Stage IB) will test the effectiveness of a virtual coaching intervention on increasing physical
activity among older adults living alone with SCD. Trial 2 (Stage 1) will test if a virtual intervention that focuses
on MoBC targets of interpersonal and social processes will result in increased ability to care for one’s physical,
emotional, and social needs and plan for care. The BID Core will be co-led by Fang Yu (senior trialist who
developed and tested iPad exergame and reminiscing interventions via Stages 0 & 1 ADRD trials) and Thomas
Parsons (leading scientist for novel technology research such as developing and testing Virtual Patient to
deliver cognitive behavioral therapy). The specific aims are to 1) ensure timely implementation and completion
of clinical trials of MoBC-driven, technology-enabled interventions in older adults living alone with cognitive
decline; and 2) assist in the development and grant submission of next-stage trials to test the effects of the
MoBC-driven, technology-enabled interventions on mechanistic, proximal, and long-term outcomes in older
adults living alone with cognitive decline. A timeline will be set up for each Trial Investigator. The BID Core is
innovative in using technology to empower older adults living alone with cognitive decline and maintain their
safety and QoL. It will enact a standard individualized process to grow a cadre of scientists and interventions
and assess common strength-based and patient-reported outcomes."

Within the past decade, single cell biology has exploded, and researchers now routinely characterize the
molecular contents of individual cells obtained from both in vitro and in vivo contexts. However, the most widely
used methods remain limited in critical ways. Through the first cycle of this award, we substantially broadened
the scope and improved the performance of an exponentially scalable paradigm called single cell combinatorial
indexing (“sci-*”). This included the development of new sci-* methods for nuclear oligo hashing, chemical
transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics and nascent transcriptomics, as well as markedly improved versions of
sci-RNA-seq and sci-ATAC-seq. In parallel, we laid the foundation for a new generation of molecular recorders
based on prime editing, termed DNA Typewriter and ENGRAM. In this renewal application, we propose to further
advance sci-* and related methods with the goal of enabling the massively scalable perturbation and readout of
multicellular model systems. Specifically, we propose to develop methods for: (1) “targeted molecular queries”
of individual cells in sci-* experiments (payload, location, effect) that can be correlated with their genome-wide
molecular states (Aim 1); (2) spatially-resolved chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiling with
minimal or no optics, over a range of physical scales (Aim 2); and (3) molecular recording of both cell lineage
and cell state to the genome, and efficient recovery of recorded histories via single cell profiling (Aim 3). Finally,
in addition to continuing our practice of open and early sharing of protocols, data and software, we will proactively
simplify and standardize newly developed methods and software for a broad range of users, in order to
accelerate their adoption by the community (Aim 4). Of note, we have structured our plans to initially demonstrate

spatial coordinates and lineage/state history in conjunction with a paradigm that now routinely scales to millions
of single cells, we aim to lay the technical foundation for multiplex perturbational experiments of multicellular
models of human biology at an unprecedented scale. Looking even further ahead, we envision that the
systematic perturbation and single cell profiling of such complex model systems will powerfully inform
quantitative models of gene regulation."

 Clostridioides difficile is a Gram-positive, spore forming and strictly anaerobic and pathogenic bacterium
that is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea worldwide. C. difficile infections (CDI) are highly
contagious, difficult to treat and prevent recurrence of the infection. There are several critical gaps in our current
knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of persistence of C. difficile spores during CDI-treatment that lead to
recurrence of the infection. Our long-term goals are to elucidate how C. difficile spores interact with the intestinal
mucosa to facilitate spore-persistence and how these interactions lead to disease recurrence. Our previous
studies revealed that C. difficile spores internalized and adhered in intestinal epithelial cells act as a reservoir for
the recurrence of the infection. These results lead to our central hypothesis: that C. difficile spores combine
intracellular and adherence mechanisms to persist in the intestinal mucosa during infection and treatment, to
drive disease recurrence. Towards this hypothesis, we found that C. difficile spores internalize into intestinal
epithelial cells (IECs). During vancomycin treatment of C. difficile-infected mice, we observed in ileal, cecum,
and colonic samples, significant persistence of adhered and intracellular C. difficile spores. We observed that C.
difficile spores interact, in a concentration dependent manner, with the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin
(Fn) and vitronectin (Vn), and uses them as molecular bridges to gain entry into IECs in an a5b1 and avb1 integrin-
dependent manner. The spore surface protein, BclA3, is essential for spore entry into IECs via the Fn/Vn-integrin
pathway. BclA3 contributes to disease recurrence, apparently by enhancing spore adherence to the intestinal
mucosa. Administration of the cholesterol-sequestering agent, nystatin, strongly attenuated spore entry into IECs
in an ileal and colonic loop mouse model, while administration of nystatin during vancomycin treatment of C.
difficile-infected mice diminished disease recurrence in mice. Our results also show that E-cadherin interacts
with C. difficile spores and plays a role in spore-adherence to IECs, and that E-cadherin-mediated spore-
adherence to IECs is enhanced by toxin-mediated damage, which may also play a role in recurrence of CDI.
Guided by our strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three Specific Aims to characterize the mechanism
underlying the interactions between C. difficile spores and the intestinal mucosa that contribute to recurrence of
the infection: (1) Dissect the mechanism of internalization of C. difficile spores into intestinal epithelial cells; (2)
Determine the role of adhered and intracellular spores in C. difficile persistence and disease recurrence; (3)
Investigate the impact of toxins in E-cadherin-mediated C. difficile persistence and infection recurrence.
Completion of these aims may expose novel targets for decolonization, therapeutics, and vaccine strategies to
combat this pathogen."

 Microvascular (MV) changes occur early in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain. Loss of MV basement
membrane (BM) integrity due to alterations in Collagen IV (Col IV), a major component of BM, in particular
predisposes the MV to complications such as microhemorrhages. In the MV of both AD and the related condition
of congophilic amyloid angiopathy (CAA), levels of Col IV vary and deposition of amyloid beta (Ab) is in close
spatial proximity, but specific interactions between Col IV and Ab are not known. Notably, we recently found that
the Ab binding antibody, lecanemab (BAN2401), causes degradation of MV Col IV. Thus, we hypothesize that
Ab deposition induces structural and/or enzymatic processes that result in MV BM Col IV destabilization,
and that subsequent removal of Ab by lecanemab results in Col IV breakdown, causing MV dysfunction.
 Brain Col IV is restricted to the vascular BM, and requires models that retain native Col IV and Ab to advance
understanding of MV extracellular matrix (ECM). We propose 3 feasible aims to elucidate the interactions of Ab
and Col IV in AD. Since little is known about the associations of Ab and Col IV in AD, Aim 1 will define the
ultrastructural/spatial relationships among Ab, Col IV, and mediators of Col IV degradation in MV of AD/CAA and
control brain sections, and in matched viable human brain MV (huMV). Aim 2 will use the 5xFAD mouse model
of MV Ab to determine if/how Ab deposition, and subsequent Ab removal, affects Col IV and subsequent MV
function in a mouse model of microvascular Ab. Aim 3 leverages a unique repository of viable human brain MV
from AD/CAA and controls to define how modifying Ab by 2 different methods: the Ab binding antibody,
lecanemab, and breaker peptides, a small molecule non-antibody mediated method of removing Ab, effects
changes in Col IV and the neurovascular unit (NVU).
Impact: Completion of this project will advance the understanding of brain MV Col IV interactions with Aβ that
are likely important in mediating MV dysfunction in the context of AD/CAA progression. In addition, our project
offers mechanistic insight on the adverse effects of Aβ-lowering therapies, which is needed for advancements
to improve their safety."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes the blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and transmigration of
inflammatory immune cells into the brain, an important mechanism underlying neurovascular damage and
neuroinflammation. Adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells is a critical step in the migration of leukocytes
into injured tissues. Previously, it has been demonstrated that activation of leukocytes, especially neutrophils
cause the release of nuclear and granular contents to form an extensive web-like structure of DNA called
neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). However, in TBI, the mechanism of injury-induced formation of NET and
its mechanistic regulatory role in thrombosis remains elusive. Moreover, it is not clear whether blocking of
formation of NET provides better outcomes after TBI. Therefore, an approach to suppress the formation of
NET would be a valuable therapeutic strategy and to analyze the efficacy of the therapy in the functional
recovery level after TBI. Here, we hypothesize that inhibition of peptidyl arginine deiminase type 4 (PAD4), an
enzyme required for NET formation, using PAD4 antagonistic peptide (PAP) will attenuate the formation of
NET, NET-induced thrombosis, and promote neovascularization and functional recovery after TBI. In the first
aim, we test whether PAP reduces PAD4 expression, inhibits NET formation, and promotes
neovascularization. In the second specific aim, we will uncover the molecular mechanisms of the formation of
NET-induced thrombosis in TBI and we will dissect the therapeutic role of PAP in depleting NET-dependent
thrombosis. We will validate the role of PAD4 in the formation of NET and its role in thrombosis by
CRISPR/Cas9 mediated PAD4 gene deletion in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVECs) and
human neutrophil co-culture in vitro and PAD4 knockout (KO) mice (PAD4−/−) in vivo. In addition, we will study
the role of different brain cells in NET formation by creating conditional knockout mice by breeding PAD4flox
strain with specific brain cell Cre strains. In the third aim, we will use a cohort of behavioral tests that include
sensorimotor functions, memory, and psychological stress analyses to validate the role of PAP in promoting
functional recovery following TBI. Therefore, in this project, to validate the central hypothesis, these three aims
target a subset of events towards unraveling a larger picture of neurovascular remodeling and functional
recovery after TBI by attenuating PAD4 activity using a novel small peptide developed in the PI’s lab."
10881488,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The brain serotonin (5-HT) system has been a target for multiple weight loss therapies. Compounds that elevate
5-HT content reduce food intake and body weight. Our previous and current findings show that 5-HT acts on two
postsynaptic 5-HT receptors, Htr2c and Htr1b in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) to suppress
food intake. Within the ARH, 5-HT reciprocally inhibits the orexigenic AgRP neurons (via Htr1b) while activating
the anorectic POMC neurons (via Htr2c). Moreover, we have demonstrated that Htr2c and Htr1b in these neurons
are necessary for the anorectic effects of 5-HT agents including the once-popular diet pill Fen/Phen.
However, despite these significant findings, the precise source of the presynaptic 5-HT inputs to ARH neurons
remains largely elusive. This has posed a considerable challenge due to the heterogeneity of 5-HT neurons in
the midbrain dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), comprising multiple subpopulations with distinct projection patterns
and physiological functions. Consequently, our current proposal aims to unravel the neural circuit mechanism by
which 5-HT regulates satiety.
To accomplish this, we propose a multidisciplinary approach to isolate the 5-HT neurons that innervate the ARH
(5-HTARH neurons). Our central hypothesis posits that these neurons provide direct synaptic inputs to the ARH
and play a critical role in feeding regulation. To investigate this, we will use in vivo calcium imaging to determine
the activity patterns of 5-HTARH neurons during hunger and satiety in behaving mice [Aim 1a]. Furthermore, we
will manipulate the activity of these neurons in live mice by either stimulating or inhibiting them, aiming to uncover
their specific contributions to food intake [Aim 1b]. Finally, we have developed a new intersectional genetic
approach that enables us to selectively deplete 5-HT inputs to the ARH in adult mice and evaluate their
physiological impact on energy homeostasis [Aim 2]."
10881537,"Our group seeks to identify new molecular structures formed by unusual enzymatic transformations. We focus
on the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), of which nearly 50 distinct
structural classes exist. Decades of research show that while RiPPs harbor diverse structures and functions,
the biosynthetic routes share a blueprint. Typical RiPP precursor peptides contain fewer than 60 amino acids.
The modification enzymes engage the N-terminal portion, while the C-terminal region receives all post-trans-
lational modifications (PTMs). Genome mining for RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) had been ex-
tremely time-consuming and often unsuccessful owing to the difficulty of locating the requisite substrate pep-
tide(s). The short length and hypervariability of RiPP precursor peptides frequently preclude their detection
by automated gene finders. RODEO, an AI-based genome mining tool, has largely solved this problem for a
subset of RiPP classes. The current proposal unites RODEO-enabled genomics analysis, enzyme chemistry,
structural biology, and microbial physiology to characterize several “RiPP-like” BGCs that do not conform to
the current definition of a RiPP natural product.
With the breadth and depth of RiPP genomics coming into sharper focus, it has become increasingly clear
that many “RiPP-like” BGCs lack a canonical precursor peptide. Rare PTMs such as backbone thioamidation
and thioether crosslinks between cysteine and the side chains of other amino acids are known on larger
protein substrates, such as methyl-coenzyme M reductase, ribosomal protein uL16, and quinohemoprotein
amine dehydrogenase. These examples establish limited but critical precedent, and we herein predict that
many more “RiPP-like PTMs” occur on protein substrates. Comparative analysis in prokaryotes supports this
prediction, as a substantial level of sequence and genome neighborhood similarity exists between pathways
encoding a canonical precursor peptide versus a larger protein substrate.
This renewal project tackles several questions of outstanding interest regarding the interplay and utility of
RiPP-like PTMs on non-canonical substrates. The specific aims are independently achievable and robustly
combine in silico, in vitro, and in vivo methods. In one aspect, we will elucidate the biochemical function of
ribosome thioamidation and the extent to which this PTM is propagated among other prokaryotes. Additional
thioamidated proteins and their physiological roles will be discovered during this project. Further, we will pur-
sue biosynthetic pathways predicted to produce poly-thioether-stabilized protein nanotubes and poly-isopep-
tide-containing branched copolymers. The enzymes performing this usual PTM chemistry will be thoroughly
evaluated, and the biological roles of the protein ultrastructures will be determined. Our preliminary data, rich
environment, and strong investigative team place us in an ideal position to address these aims that will sig-
nificantly advance the study of RiPP protein chemistry and microbiology."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases the risks for cognitive impairment and dementia, such as Alzheimer’s
disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD). Multiple human imaging studies of the brains
after traumatic brain injury reported the signs of prominent microglial activation in the thalamus that highly
correlates with cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, the role of thalamic microglia in cognitive impairment after
TBI remains unclear. We have recently discovered a unique role of thalamic microglia in cortical injury-induced
recognition memory deficits in mice. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that local depletion of thalamic
microglia, not hippocampal microglia, counteracted recognition memory deficits. Thalamic microglial depletion
also improved thalamic neuronal survival and restored c-Fos expression in multiple recognition memory-related
brain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), hippocampus (HPC), and perirhinal cortex (PRh).
Local activation of thalamic neurons restored recognition memory deficits, highlighting a primary role of
thalamic neuropathology in the behavioral phenotype. Our single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data
revealed the development of microglial subtypes in the thalamus, including the one with high phagocytic
capability. Consistent with the molecular findings, the thalamic microglia in the injured brains engulfed neurons
and inhibition of phagocytosis attenuated recognition memory deficits in the injured mice. These data suggest
that thalamic microglia may promote recognition memory deficits by damaging neurons and synapses. Thus, in
the proposed study, we will test our hypothesis that excessive microglial phagocytosis in the thalamus after
cortical injuries damages neurons and synapses, causing cognitive impairment. We will use a well-established
cortical controlled impact (CCI) model in mice. In Aim 1, we will elucidate cortical injury-induced microglial
changes and their effects on neurons in the thalamus. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate that removal of thalamic
microglia has an immediate restorative effect and a long-term ameliorative effect on recognition memory in the
injured mice. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the effects of microglial phagocytosis inhibition on thalamic neuronal
pathology and cognitive impairment after cortical injuries. Together, this study will assess the role of thalamic
microglia phagocytosis in cognitive impairment after cortical injuries. The findings will provide a novel
mechanistic insight into the critical thalamic pathology underlying TBI-induced long-term neurological deficits."

 To optimally estimate properties of the environment, one should use all available sensory and prior infor-
mation. Sensory input arises from multiple sensory modalities, and is uncertain due to physical and neural
noise. An ideal observer must combine all cues, taking into account cue reliability and considering alternative
causes for discrepancies between cues such as inferring that they derive from different objects (i.e., separate
causes) or that one or both sense modalities are miscalibrated. Human behavior is often consistent with “opti-
mal” cue integration defined as maximizing combined-cue reliability. Can observers access internal estimates
of reliability for confidence judgments to inform subsequent behavior? What computations does the brain use
to solve these problems and how do they unfold over time?
 We tackle these questions by combining computational theory and behavioral experiments to elucidate the
dynamics and time course of multisensory cue integration. The standard framework for understanding sensory
integration incorporates five key components: (1) reliability-based cue weighting, (2) integration of prior infor-
mation, (3) causal inference, (4) cross-modal recalibration and (5) confidence in the sensory estimates. Past
work on multisensory cue integration has primarily dealt with situations that are static, but the world is dynamic
and ever-changing, many activities (locomotion, driving, sports, etc.) depend critically on combining information
over time and on temporal estimates, and sensory cue integration unfolds over time. In Aim 1, we will develop
and test models of multisensory temporal perception, both for relative timing and perception of duration as well
as understanding how spatial and temporal correlation jointly contribute to causal inference. In Aim 2 we look
at sensory-motor integration from a similar perspective: the planning and execution of movement also involves
multisensory integration prior to, during, and after a movement, both for movement itself and for judgments
about movement success. Finally, in Aim 3 we look at the use of multiple visual and other sensory cues for
perception of heading and object motion from optic flow and other cues. We will study whether the five compo-
nents of multisensory integration help us to better understand the analysis of optic flow over time, and integrat-
ing optic flow with natural self-motion in a virtual environment, for the estimation of heading and detection of
moving objects.
 These studies will shed light on the dynamic processes used to combine sensory information to form a co-
herent percept, the unfolding of sensory integration as perceptual decisions are made, and how our senses
guide us in an ever-changing world. A better understanding of the dynamics of these processes will inform fu-
ture studies on the neural implementation of these computations. These experiments on healthy humans will
provide a starting point for understanding multisensory perception in individuals in which these systems are
compromised by conditions that impact sensory input (e.g., amblyopia, macular degeneration, stroke)."

Identification of small molecules that extend mouse lifespan provides new insights into mechanisms of
longevity determination in mammals, and may lay the groundwork for eventual anti-aging therapies in humans.
The NIA Interventions Testing Program (ITP) evaluates agents proposed to extend mouse lifespan by
retardation of aging or postponement of late life diseases. Interventions proposed by multiple collaborating
scientists from the research community are tested, in parallel, at three sites (Jackson Laboratories, University
of Michigan and University of Texas), using very similar, standardized protocols, and using sufficient numbers
of genetically heterogeneous mice to provide 80% power for detecting changes in lifespan of 10%, for either
sex, after pooling data from any two of the test sites. One hundred and two such lifespan experiments,
involving various doses of 66 distinct agents, have been initiated in the first twenty years of the ITP. Thirty-six
experiments have involved comparative tests of multiple doses of effective agents, variable starting ages, or
alternative dosing schedules. Statistically significant effects on longevity, in one or both sexes, have been
documented and then confirmed for NDGA, rapamycin, acarbose, 17-α-estradiol (17aE2), and canagliflozin.
Significant effects were also noted for Protandim, glycine, meclizine, captopril, and astaxanthin. Lifespan trials
are now underway for 25 new agents. ITP survival results have also documented longevity benefits from four
agents started in middle-age: rapamycin, acarbose, 17aE2, and canagliflozin. A Collaborative Interactions
Program (CIP) has provided tissues from ITP drug-treated mice to an open, growing, international network of
scientific collaborators, meeting 26 requests from 17 distinct laboratories in the previous five-year period. Plans
for the next five-year period include additional lifespan (""Stage 1"") trials, detailed analyses (""Stage 2"") of
agents found to increase lifespan, transition from the CIP to an Interventions Biospecimens Repository,
additional diagnostic specificity in pathological assessments, inclusion of RNA-Seq data in all Stage 2
protocols, and comprehensive pharmacokinetic assessments of drugs found to increase lifespan, as well as
continued collaborative work with a network of scientists to study drug effects on postulated aging mechanisms
and links to disease. Site-specific Stage 2 studies at UT will add pharmacokinetic analyses in young and old
mice, tests to determine mechanisms underlying sex-differences of successful Stage 1 compounds, and tests
to determine effects on metabolism of successful Stage 1 compounds. The work proposed should allow the
ITP to continue to make major contributions to mammalian aging biology."
10880934,"Project Summary/Abstract
Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) are grossly underutilized in clinical
applications. Yet the need for early and accurate diagnosis as well as monitoring of new
therapies is growing and will demand more precise diagnostic tools. This proposal lays the
foundation for assimilating advanced DPOAE diagnostics into clinical practice. Specifically, the
first aim will validate the test performance of a new protocol for recording DP-Grams. This
protocol will use frequency-specific stimulus conditions that are matched to local properties of
the cochlea with the goal of better detection of mild-to-moderate hearing loss. The second aim
will utilize DPOAE growth functions to detect early changes in the cochlea due to aging and
differentiate these effects from those induced by over-exposure to noise. The third aim will use
an innovative expansion of DPOAEs to objectively estimate cochlear tuning. The proposal will
create a two-dimensional joint metric of tuning and DPOAE strength, which will help to identify
hearing-related declines beyond mere changes in sensitivity. The proposed work also serves
the critical need to extend the frequency bandwidth of all DPOAE applications to the highest
frequencies of human hearing. This is made possible by incorporating modern calibration and
signal delivery/recording techniques – developed in part by the laboratories of both PIs – into all
experiments. The proposed experiments are built on previous peer-reviewed and published
work from the two participating laboratories. Taken together, the proposed experiments are
critical next steps necessary to move DPOAEs from a screening tool to potent clinical probe that
serves the next generation of diagnostic and monitoring needs."
10881257,"Although significant advances in the treatment of opiate addiction have been made, relapse to opiate use after
abstinence continues to impede successful treatment, highlighting the need for efforts to dissect the
mechanism of opiate-dependent changes in brain function. Long-lasting associations between opiates and the
context in which they are taken result in cues that lead to drug craving and ultimately relapse. The
hippocampus represents a key structure in the integration of emotional processing, learning and memory, and
reward-related behaviors. While the ventral subdivision of the hippocampus (vHPC) is involved in processing
emotional values of salient stimuli and goal-directed behaviors, the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) plays a critical
role in episodic, spatial, and associative memory. In addition, it has been shown that the dHPC is necessary for
context- and cue-associated reward behaviors, including the expression of reward seeking. Further, we found
that chemogenetic inhibition of glutamatergic dHPC neurons reduces cue-induced morphine-seeking in an
instrumental model of relapse. Together, these findings indicate that the dHPC is important for the
development and maintenance of opioid-cue associations necessary for drug-seeking behavior. Integration of
rewarding and aversive stimuli relies on the mesolimbic reward circuit, where the nucleus accumbens (NAc)
plays a crucial role. The NAc facilitates reward seeking by integrating dopaminergic reinforcement signals with
glutamate-encoded environmental and cue stimuli. Although glutamatergic inputs to the NAc from the ventral
hippocampus have been reported, our preliminary data show that dense projections to the NAc also originate
in the dHPC. Interestingly, we found that photo-stimulation of excitatory dHPC neurons is rewarding and
reinforcing using a real-time place preference test and instrumental self-stimulation, respectively. Interestingly,
this dHPC stimulation was accompanied by enhanced activity of accumbal neurons and evoked local field
potentials within the NAc. No studies have examined whether the dHPCNAc is involved in opioid-seeking
behavior. Characterization of the cellular mechanisms initiated by the alterations in glutamatergic transmission
from the dHPC to the NAc observed during opioid self-administration is necessary to identify novel molecular
targets that might prevent drug relapse triggered by the exposure to drug-associated cues. Therefore, the
overall goal of this proposal is to investigate the role of excitatory transmission from the dHPC to the NAc in
opioid-seeking behavior and identify novel molecular targets that may mitigate the influence of drug-cue
associations on relapse. Accordingly, the aims here will 1) determine whether dHPC to NAc projecting neurons
are necessary and sufficient for fentanyl-seeking; 2) examine the effects of fentanyl-seeking behavior on
function and plasticity of NAc neurons downstream of dHPC projections; 3) determine the role of dHPCNAc
dynorphin- or enkephalin-containing synapses in fentanyl-seeking behavior. Findings generated from this
project will have significant translational potential for understanding the mechanisms of drug relapse."
10882833,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the United States, imposing
a significant economic burden due to its high morbidity and mortality. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive
Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria is a universally accepted disease severity staging score. However, GOLD score
is not a strong predictor for mortality or progression risk at early or pre-disease stages. Early intervention is
crucial for slowing COPD progression and improving quality of life. Therefore, there is a need to develop robust,
quantitative metrics for characterizing disease state and progression risk. Existing quantitative computer
tomography (CT) methods are based on analyzing variations in CT Hounsfield Units (HU) and have shown
moderate to strong correlation with disease state. However, HU values are known to be breathing-effort
dependent. As a result, quantitative CT methods require heuristic normalization schemes to adjust for varying
lung inflation levels and are known to lack reproducibility. We previously developed a robust class of CT-derived
ventilation (CTV) methods that calculate breathing-induced volume changes apparent on inhale/exhale CT (IE-
CT) image pairs, as a surrogate for ventilation. In addition to numerical stability, our CTV demonstrated a higher
correlation with nuclear medicine-based ventilation imaging than any other method in the literature. We recently
extended the CTV framework to calculate changes in blood mass apparent on IE-CT, as a surrogate for
pulmonary perfusion. Our novel CT-Perfusion (CTP), taken together with CTV, comprise our CT-derived
functional imaging (CTFI) methodology. CTFIis the first to mathematically describe changes in inhale/exhale HU
values in terms of ventilation and perfusion. This allows us to compute VQ (ventilation/perfusion) ratio imaging
that is inherently normalized to patient breathing effort. Thus, any early microvascular changes or VQ mismatch
associated with COPD disease severity can potentially be detected and quantified on IE-CT images. We
hypothesize that a CTFI-informed machine learning model has higher discriminative power in assessing survival
and disease progression than traditional methods such as FEV1, BODE index and other quantitative imaging
markers. To test this hypothesis, we will utilize data from the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDgene) study,
a multicenter observational study designed to identify genetic factors associated with COPD. We will adapt state-
of-the art unsupervised deep learning methods and fully leverage the rich COPDgene data set to train a lung
lobe segmentation model and automate the CTFI calculation pipeline. Next, we will develop and validate both
physics-based and deep learning-based CTFI VQ scoring methods. Finally, we will develop a machine learning
model which takes clinical information and patient CTFI lobar scores (ventilation, perfusion, & VQ) as input, and
quantifies disease severity, predicts 5-year survival, and predicts future exacerbation and progression risk. All
developed software and training data will be made publicly available to encourage further research in this field."

 The major goal of this project is to understand how glypicans protect against bacterial lung infection by
coordinating a cellular defense mechanism that promotes bacterial clearance and inhibits bacterial invasion.
Pathogens use all tricks available to survive in the hostile host environment. Many pathogens bind to host
extracellular matrix (ECM) components and their receptors for their attachment, invasion and immune evasion,
suggesting that normal functions of the ECM are exploited for pathogenesis. However, while both host cells
and microbes are known to change their phenotypes and adapt to the artificial environment when cultured in
vitro, the current paradigm that the host ECM promotes infection as attachment and invasion receptors is
based predominately on data from in vitro systems. Furthermore, while the ability of the ECM to promote
pathogenesis has received much of the attention, potential beneficial functions of ECM components in
infections have been largely ignored. The abundant expression of ECM components and their receptors at
sites where pathogens frequently encounter the host, such as at the cell surface and subepithelial
compartments, suggests that certain ECM components may actually function in host defense. Glypicans, of
which there are 6 members in mammals, comprise a major family of cell surface heparan sulfate
proteoglycans, that function as receptors for morphogens, growth factors, cytokines/chemokines, and ECM
components, among other heparin/heparan sulfate-binding proteins. We found in preliminary studies that
glypican-4 null (Gpc4-/-) mice are significantly hypersusceptible to Staphylococcus aureus lung infection,
suggesting that Gpc4 protects against S. aureus pathogenesis. S. aureus is a major human pathogen and it
has a unique ability to infect virtually every tissue and organ system, including the lung. Our studies suggested
that Gpc4 provides protection against S. aureus lung infection via 2 distinct mechanisms: a neutrophil-
dependent and a neutrophil-independent mechanism in which Gpc4 inhibits S. aureus invasion into host cells.
This proposal will establish the importance of these previously unknown mechanisms and define their
molecular and cellular details in 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine how glypicans regulate early neutrophil
recruitment in bacterial infection. Aim 2 will define how glypicans inhibit bacterial entry of host cells, and Aim 3
will elucidate how bacteria counteract defense mechanisms mediated by glypicans."

Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling controls the polarization of cells within the plane of an epithelium, orienting
asymmetric cellular structures, cell divisions, and cell migration and is well conserved from Drosophila to
vertebrates. In vertebrates, defects in the core PCP mechanism result in a range of developmental anomalies
and diseases including conotruncal heart defects, open neural tube defects, deafness, and situs inversus and
heterotaxy, among others. Congenital heart disease (CHD) comprises close to half of all birth defects, and
conotruncal heart malformations are the most common CHDs in humans, and include anomalies such as
double outlet right ventricle, transposition of the great arteries, and overriding aorta. Despite its critical role in
the development of the heart and other organs, the molecular mechanisms that drive PCP signaling remain
remarkably poorly understood.
Although a mechanistic dissection of PCP signaling would be prohibitively difficult in the mammalian heart,
mechanistic conservation in PCP signaling allows findings from highly tractable model systems to translate
readily to PCP in mammalian systems. Drosophila is an ideal system for studying PCP due to its highly
developed genetic tools, its history as a PCP model system, and its suitability for high-resolution microscopy.
In this project, we will leverage the experimental tractability of the Drosophila model system, in combination
with cutting-edge biochemical and biophysical approaches, to elucidate the mechanistic basis for PCP
signaling. We propose two independent but interrelated Aims that will i) elucidate the feedback circuits and
molecular interactions that lead to the induction of asymmetry, and ii) determine how clustering contributes to
the amplification of asymmetry, to polarity readout, or both. To accomplish this, we will employ novel genetic
approaches to unlock understanding of extensive feedback mechanisms in PCP signaling, single-molecule
biophysical approaches that will reveal how clustering is coupled to the amplification and readout of
asymmetry, and advanced biochemical approaches that will provide direct molecular insight into how intrinsic
asymmetry in PCP complexes is achieved and into how oligomerization may result in clustering.
The proposed work will both enhance our knowledge of fundamental mechanisms underlying PCP signaling,
as well as lay the groundwork for potential therapeutic interventions for PCP-related heart pathologies."

 Congenital myotonic dystrophy (CDM), the most severe form of myotonic dystrophy, causes muscle
weakness, breathing problems, and feeding difficulties at birth. During childhood affected individuals
experience intellectual impairment and gastrointestinal issues while, in contrast, muscle strength and
weakness improve. Muscle symptoms associated with adults with myotonic dystrophy, including myotonia and
fatigue, are not observed until individuals reach adolescence. In the previous proposal period, the investigators
clinically defined this triphasic pattern of motor involvement via enrollment of over 100 children in a
comprehensive clinical study to evaluate measures of physical function over 12 months.
 In adults with myotonic dystrophy, a toxic RNA repeat expansion leads to global dysregulation of RNA
splicing. Within the previous proposal period we performed RNA sequencing on 36 congenital myotonic
dystrophy muscle biopsies from individuals 2 weeks to 16 years of age. We found that the severity of RNA mis-
splicing mirrored the triphasic course of muscle symptoms captured clinically; children in early childhood
showed improvement in RNA splicing dysregulation that regressed in adolescence. This result was bolstered
by the inclusion of biopsies sampled from individuals at two ages across development. While these
observations correlate with the clinical course of CDM, the mechanisms responsible for these dynamic shifts in
mis-splicing remain unknown. This proposal is designed further clarify and define the molecular mechanisms
responsible for the clinical and molecular progression of CDM.
 In Aim 1, we will enroll additional children with CDM that have acquired a previous muscle biopsy in a
clinical follow-up study to acquire both longitudinal assessments of muscle function and a secondary muscle
biopsy. RNA sequencing will be performed and mis-splicing and gene expression quantified to validate the
course of CDM disease pathogenesis. In Aim 2 and 3, we will evaluate two potential molecular mechanisms
based on our prior data that may contribute to the complex trajectory of CDM disease. In Aim 2, we will define
the proliferative and regenerative capacity of CDM muscle stem cells across pediatric development and the
contribution mediated via the IGF2 mitogenic signaling axis. In Aim 3, we will define how expression of core
spliceosomal patterns contribute to the unique mis-splicing signatures observed within cohorts of CDM
individuals. At the completion of this project, we will have validated the clinical and molecular course of CDM
disease progression across pediatric development and performed experiments vital to understanding the
mechanisms that contribute to this dynamic pattern. By better understanding the pathogenesis of CDM, we
both allow access of these children to forthcoming disease modifying therapies in myotonic dystrophy, as well
as, identify new therapeutic targets for drug development."

With this R13 application, we request funding to support, in part, the costs for planning, publicizing, and hosting
the 39th, 40th, and 41st Annual Symposia on Nonhuman Primate Models for AIDS. For four decades, this
symposium has served as the premier scientific forum for the exchange of information, including new research
findings and scientific perspectives, among HIV/AIDS investigators whose research includes studies in
nonhuman primates (NHPs). Disseminating the latest research findings in NHP models of AIDS while also
facilitating discussion and exchange of information between basic scientists and clinicians remains a priority,
as do focusing on emerging technologies to accelerate translation of NHP studies into the clinic and engaging
a broader and more diverse group of researchers in HIV/AIDS research in NHP models. This meeting, the only
one of its kind in the world, convenes an international group of scientists whose research focuses on the study
of natural and experimental immunodeficiency virus infections in NHPs, as well as on the development of novel
therapeutics, prophylactic vaccines for HIV, and curative approaches. Emerging topics in related infectious
diseases (such as COVID-19 pathogenesis, vaccines and treatment) may also be included. The seven National
Primate Research Centers (NPRCs) host this meeting in rotation, and upcoming symposia hosts will be the
Yerkes (2022), California (2023), and Tulane (2024) NPRCs. We plan a hybrid format with most participants
attending in person and others joining online to access oral and poster sessions. The conference will begin on
day 1 with registration, a keynote address by a leading HIV/AIDS researcher, and an evening reception. The
following two and a half days will include scientific presentations from invited speakers and accepted oral
abstracts. Each symposium scientific committee will select session topics and speakers to highlight new and
cutting-edge technologies in their respective fields. Each session will open with a 30-minute talk by an invited
chair. Individuals whose abstracts are accepted for oral presentations will give the remaining session talks. A
poster session will occur on the evening of day 2, and there will be a banquet on the evening of day 3. As is
traditional for this symposium, the Journal of Medical Primatology will publish all poster and oral abstracts in a
special issue. In partnership with the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the NHP AIDS Symposium will also
host a pre-symposium meeting for early stage investigators (ESI). This meeting will be open to the attendees
of a linked ESI Conference the HVTN sponsors. ESI attendees and mentors will focus on grant writing,
budgeting, and networking, and will participate in a Q&A with NIH Program Officers. We believe bringing
together researchers from a variety of diverse backgrounds will generate future collaborations and scientific
advances. Knowledge shared and gained at upcoming Annual Nonhuman Primate Models for AIDS Symposia
will further the continued, effective use of NHP models to maintain long term control of HIV replication in the
absence of antiretroviral therapy and to design interventions to prevent or eradicate HIV infection."

 Despite recent FDA approval of new therapies to treat lupus nephritis, most patients fail to achieve
clinical remission with standard-of-care treatment. This is particularly important for pediatric patients who
exhibit a higher risk for developing lupus nephritis and have a longer potential to accrue kidney damage.
This emphasizes the need for greater understanding of the pathophysiology of lupus nephritis, with the
expectation that this knowledge will inform the development of effective, targeted therapies for lupus
nephritis. To date, pre-clinical studies have typically used animal models to identify immune pathways
driving disease, but these efforts have been plagued by limited correlation with clinical benefit in humans.
For this reason, the ability to directly analyze human kidney tissue from lupus nephritis patients is of
significant importance. Over the past 5 years, single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) has been used to study
many immune-mediated kidney diseases, from IgA nephropathy to lupus nephritis. However, there are
many limitations to standard droplet-based scRNA-Seq protocols. First, tissue dissociation can induce
an artifactual transcriptional stress response and all spatial context of the data is lost. Second, several
important kidney cell types (such as podocytes, rare immune populations) are sensitive to tissue
dissociation and thus under-sampled by scRNA-Seq. Finally, current scRNA-Seq protocols require
immediate processing of fresh kidney biopsy tissue, a major limitation for rare disorders such as
childhood-onset lupus nephritis.
 This application leverages a major technical advance to perform spatial transcriptomic analysis at
single cell resolution on archived kidney biopsy tissue. In Aim 1, we will use the GeoMX Digital Spatial
Profiler (Nanostring, Inc.) to quantify whole transcriptome gene expression in affected vs. unaffected
glomeruli from pediatric patients with Class III and Class IV lupus nephritis. In Aim 2, we will perform
single cell spatial transcriptomics on primary and validation cohorts of pediatric lupus nephritis using the
new single cell resolution CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager (Nanostring, Inc.). Finally, in Aim 3, we will
compare the immune and renal stromal transcriptional signatures of lupus nephritis with other
glomerulonephritides to identify shared and unique pathways in SLE. In addition to advancing our
understanding of lupus nephritis pathophysiology, we anticipate that these efforts will generate a
spatially-resolved cell atlas of human lupus nephritis that will be an important resource for investigators
in academia and industry."

Deprescribing is an essential component of safe and effective health care for older adults, with particular relevance to older adults with vulnerabilities such as multimorbidity and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) that place them at high risk of adverse consequences from unnecessary, harmful, and goal-discordant medication use. Yet, deprescribing is much easier said than done. There is a paucity of research about how to safely and effectively stop medications among older adults, including those with ADRD and other forms of vulnerability, and the medical research paradigm is based on testing and implementing new treatments rather than the removal of treatments. Supplementing the existing paradigm with a new way of thinking requires new methods, new collaborations, and a new generation of investigators. To address this challenge, in 2019 NIA funded the U.S. Deprescribing Research Network (USDeN), a national research network whose mission is to expand the quality, quantity, and translational impact of research on deprescribing for older adults, particularly those with heightened vulnerabilities such as ADRD and multimorbidity. To date, USDeN has been remarkably successful. Educational and community-building programs have engaged hundreds of interprofessional investigators in collaborative research. Multiple pilot research projects have catalyzed new scholarship and future grant-supported research, particularly in populations with dementia, multimorbidity, and other vulnerabilities. Working groups and a data harmonization initiative have developed resources and established evidence-based best practices on foundational topics in deprescribing science. Yet, much essential work remains to be done. This proposal seeks to fund the next phase of the US Deprescribing Research Network, extending our past successes and launching new initiatives that will advance the field. Through a series of cores and programs, we seek to grow and support a national community of deprescribing investigators, aid early-career researchers with a special focus on helping them obtain grants to advance their deprescribing science and careers, advance high-priority science through targeted pilot awards and projects, and do this all with input from key stakeholders and special attention to older adults with ADRD and other forms of heightened vulnerability. Our aims are to: (1) Grow and support a national, interprofessional community of researchers focused on deprescribing for older adults, with particular focus on those with heightened vulnerability such as ADRD; (2) Enhance the research and career development of early-career investigators in deprescribing science; (3) Support high-value research initiatives including pilot grants and projects that will advance deprescribing science; and (4) Engage stakeholders and partner organizations to maximize the relevance, sustainability, and translational potential of deprescribing research. Together, these activities will advance the science and translational impact of deprescribing in older adults while elevating the career development of investigators who will lead the next generation of scholarship in this field."
10882738,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol consumption is a major risk factor for both head-and-neck and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas
(SCCs), which are both lethal and globally prevalent. The lethality of these cancers may stem from cancer cells
exhibiting high CD44 expression (CD44H), which can survive genotoxic stress and drive tumor initiation,
invasion, metastasis, therapy resistance and poor prognosis. Acetaldehyde, a major EtOH metabolite, is a potent
inducer of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). ICLs can also arise from cancer-specific processes such as
hyperactive DNA replication and cisplatin-based chemotherapy. CD44H cells can tolerate both EtOH and
cisplatin exposure. Our preliminary data suggest that ICLs accumulate in oral and esophageal preneoplasia
(PreN) and SCC lesions, both of which are recapitulated in patient- and murine-derived organoids (PDO and
MDO, respectively), and that these cells display activation of the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway, which is
responsible for ICL repair. CRISPR-mediated genetic depletion of FA pathway member FANCT, a druggable
ubiquitin E2 ligase of the FA pathway, impairs formation of SCC, but not normal MDO. Moreover,
pharmacological FANCT inhibitor kills SCC cells, but not normal cells in PDO. In organoids with dysfunctional
aldehyde dehydrogenase (Aldh)-2, a mitochondrial enzyme linked to activation of FA pathway, exposure to EtOH
gives rise to enrichment of CD44H cells, which in turn survive EtOH-induced mitochondrial damage and oxidative
stress via autophagy, a cytoprotective mechanism responsible for removing damaged mitochondria and reducing
reactive oxygen species (ROS). Inhibition of both the FA pathway and autophagy may offer a novel therapeutic
approach for the selective sensitization of CD44H cells to ICL-mediated cell death by cisplatin. The overall
objective of this renewal application is to further elucidate the mechanism of how CD44H cells survive ICLs
accumulation, which promotes cell death if left unrepaired. The central hypothesis is that CD44H cells survive
via FA pathway-mediated ICLs repair and autophagy, which may present a potential cancer cell-specific
vulnerability. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing the following interrelated Specific Aims: (1) To determine
how alcohol and ALDH2 dysfunction promote genotoxicity in PreN and SCC lesions; (2) To elucidate how the
FA pathway facilitates alcohol-mediated SCC progression; (3) To delineate how CD44H cells survive alcohol-
driven ICL burden in PreN and SCC lesions. The present proposal will make use of genetically engineered mice,
MDO, PDO and xenograft tumors. We have built a comprehensive platform for development and validation of
novel translational applications to target the FA pathway and autophagy in PreN and SCCs. Our innovative
approaches will reveal novel insights about the role of alcohol metabolism in malignant transformation of head-
and-neck and esophageal epithelial cells with a therapeutic implication. These findings have the potential for
direct clinical impact in SCC and other alcohol-related cancers."
10882030,"T cell responses rely on the T cell receptor (TCR) for antigen specificity, CD28 for a second signal, and a
cadre of additional signals including cytokines and certain TNF superfamily costimulatory receptors. The latter
includes CD134 (OX40) and CD137 (4-1BB), which provide a powerful boost to clonal expansion of effector
CD8 T cells, robust cytokine production, metabolic fitness, and many other attributes including potent anti-
tumor cytotoxicity. The molecular mechanism of costimulation-based programming in effector T cells is largely
unknown. In particular, a unique gene signature for this process, beyond generalized factors such as NFKB
and NFAT, is unclear suggesting that other critical processes have gone undetected. Our recent published
data showed only a small number of transcriptional changes after costimulation, which could not explain the
power behind costimulation. A major increase, however, in the spliceosome pathway was evident, but whether
this process could have a specific impact on effector T cells was unknown. Analysis showed that the
spliceosome pathway contained a group of RNA binding proteins involved in alternative RNA splicing, which
should not be confused with steady state core intron splicing factors. Alternative RNA splicing can mediate
exon skipping, intron retention and other processes that generate multiple mRNA isoforms from a single gene,
and thereby greatly expand the proteome of cells. We demonstrated that the RNA binding protein Tardbp
played a key role in effector T cell function. These changes in T cell function correlated with Tardbp-dependent
exon skipping in the IL-2 repressor IKAROS (Ikzf1) mRNA, and a series of other RNA splicing events that
remain to be studied. Aim 1 will examine how Tardbp programs effector CD8 T cell function by addressing
effector activities that include target cell cytotoxicity, responses to infection, and a role for specific
costimulators. Our results will be integrated with the identification of the direct mRNA isoforms generated by
Tardbp, and their potential function. Aim 2 will examine a second RNA binding protein, Tra2b, for its novel
role in controlling T cell responses through the action of an ultra-conserved ‘poison exon’ contained within the
Tra2b transcript. Using a combination of innovative approaches, we will test if Tra2b’s poison exon impacts
TCR sensitivity in CD8 and CD4 T cells during tumor immunity. For Aim 3, the RNA binding protein network
in exhausted T cells will be edited to optimize function and translatability. Our proposal uses a combination
of in silico and cutting-edge methods that will break new ground in understanding how alternative splicing
through the action of RNA binding proteins can control effector T cell programming. In sum, a new
understanding of effector T cells and their potential in clinical translation will be gained from this research."

Placenta accreta is a serious maternal condition affecting more than 1 in 300 women in the US, and rapidly
increasing in frequency. Accreta is characterized by the placenta invading too deeply into the uterus,
necessitating hysterectomy upon parturition. The major correlate of accreta (or increta, or percreta) is the
presence of previous uterine scar, mostly due to caesarian surgery, although the disease could manifest without
previous scars. Very little is understood about the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this disease,
leaving limited therapeutic avenues to pursue. Our overall hypothesis states that while normal placental
invasion is predicated on a fine balance of pro- and anti-invasable signaling at the maternal-fetal interface,
placenta accreta is a response of scar induced dysregulation in this signaling, leading to excessive and un-
controlled invasion. Specifically, we posit that the dysregulated biomechanical microenvironment at the scar
transforms decidual fibroblasts into an inflammatory state, producing chemoattractive cytokines recruiting
extravillous trophoblasts towards the scar. We have developed a framework termed ELI (Evolved Levels of
Invasability) that explains the highly invasive nature of placentation in certain mammals as primarily a stromal
characteristic. Based on ELI framework, and our preliminary findings, we posit that aberrant matrix cues from
scar dysregulate decidual defense, resulting in uncontrolled trophoblast invasion leading to accreta. Using a
bioengineered model of scar decidua (high rigidity, high collagen density, anisotropic nanotopography), we
observed dysregulated mechanoresponsive signaling in decidual fibroblasts (dESFs), resulting in chemotactic
recruitment of extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) towards scar, as well as promoting EVT invasion by altered dESF
contractility. Specifically, scar results in high activation of Protein Kinase C by Piezo-1 mechanosensitive Ca2+
channel. Increased PKC activation phosphorylates NFkB, a master regulator of inflammatory response, resulting
in production of IL-8 and G-CSF, potent chemoattractants for EVTs. In this proposal, we will elucidate the
missing links in these mechanisms using a combination of spatially defined exploration at transcriptional,
molecular and tissue level scales. We have developed many technological platforms specifically for
understanding stromal invasion of trophoblasts: a model of scar decidua that recapitulates accreta phenotype, a
nano-fabricated platform for quantification of stromal invasion, cellular force measurement at EVT-dESF
interface, and a microfluidic platform to measure paracrine cross-talk between EVTs and dESFs. As accreta is a
spatially defined pathology, we will use spatial transcriptomics in human accreta samples to identify changes
in decidual state proximal to scar. Finally, we will profile, and establish the causality of paracrine cross-talk
between dESFs and EVTs in accreta manifestation. This integrated study combining systems and mechanistic
approaches will shed light to elucidate the biology of scar induced uncontrolled placental invasion, and identify
targets to therapeutically limit accreta pathogenesis."

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic food allergen- and immune-mediated disease that exerts a significant
clinical and financial burden worldwide. Interleukin (IL)-13 is an essential mediator of EoE due its pleotropic
effects on esophageal inflammation and tissue remodeling. We have identified IL-13 as a critical mediator of
increased mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release in esophageal epithelial cells. Our
preliminary data indicate that IL-13-mediated alterations in mitochondrial mass and mtDNA release are
dependent upon JAK/STAT signaling. We further provide preliminary data suggesting that depletion of
mitochondria limits EoE-associated epithelial remodeling and inflammation. These findings support our
overarching hypothesis that IL-13 in the EoE inflammatory milieu activates STAT signaling in esophageal
epithelium to drive alterations in mitochondrial biology that promote EoE pathogenesis and may serve as novel
biomarkers in EoE patients. To test this hypothesis, we will define the direct molecular mechanisms through
which IL-13 signaling regulates mitochondrial biology (Aim 1) and the functional significance of these findings
with regard to EoE-associated tissue remodeling and inflammation (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will elucidate the
clinical significance of EoE-associated alterations in mitochondria by exploring their biomarker potential in EoE
patients (Aim 3). The proposed studies will illuminate the IL-13/STAT/mitochondria axis as a novel player in EoE
pathobiology and have great potential to improve clinical care in this disease that remains a major cause of upper
GI morbidity."
10882622,"Patients with neovascular disease, including Retinopathy of Prematurity and Familial Exudative
Vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), develop insufficiently vascularized, or hypovascular, retinas. We have observed a
similar hypovascular phenotype in the Tbx3 conditional knockout retina. Our long-term goal is to understand
how retinal neurons and vascular cells form the neurovascular unit. The objective of this proposal is to
determine the role Tbx3 plays in retinal angiogenesis as a way to uncover new molecular mechanisms driving
retinal vascular disease. In our model, TBX3 is required during three events that are essential for retinal
angiogenesis, when 1) retinal ganglion cells become metabolically active, causing retinal astrocytes to
proliferate; 2) the embryonic hyaloid vasculature regresses in response to increases in dopamine levels; and 3)
astrocytes migrate into the retina to form the astrocytic lattice. Our central hypothesis is that TBX3 regulates
signals that affect retinal angiogenesis via its regulation in three separate cell types: first, in dorsal retinal
ganglion cells, next, in dopaminergic amacrine cells, and finally, in astrocytes. The rationale underpinning this
hypothesis is that key genetic networks controlling neurogenesis and angiogenesis are shared and thereby
coordinate neurovascular coupling. We will test the central hypothesis by determining the TBX3-regulated
molecular mechanisms that affect angiogenesis in 1) dorsal retinal ganglion cells via Sonic Hedgehog
signaling, 2) dopaminergic amacrine cells via regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase, and 3) retinal astrocytes via
control of migration. Each of these aims will be pursued using a combination of large-scale transcriptomic
studies coupled with genetic manipulation and molecular analysis, which are standard technologies in our lab.
Our studies are significant because they will fill a major gap in knowledge about vascular formation and identify
new molecular pathways activated during angiogenesis. The expected outcome of this work is that it will add to
our fundamental knowledge about retinal angiogenesis. Moreover, these studies will produce a database of
dorsal-specific factors that will provide an understanding of the fundamental, cellularly distinct, differences in
this region of the retina. In addition, this research fits in well with the NEI’s goal of ‘study[ing]…genetic factors
that underlie structure, function, and the biology of retinal diseases.’ Our results will have a positive, immediate
impact because they will provide a better understanding of retinal angiogenesis, and long-term impact because
we expect our research will identify novel targets for better therapies of vascular disease."

 Photoreceptor kinases are multi-domain signaling proteins that regulate a wide range of light responses in
living organisms. They share similar modular protein architecture with many receptor kinases involved in
virulence detection, and cell metabolism, migration, and differentiation. Despite their importance in signal
transduction and disease biology, how receptor kinases couple a molecular trigger such as light absorption or
ligand binding to a phosphorylation signal remains elusive at both the structural and mechanistic levels. The
primary challenge is that these signaling proteins are intrinsically dynamic, largely limiting structural studies
to their truncated forms. However, a complete mechanistic understanding requires structural and functional
interrogation of full-length proteins in which both sensor and effector domains are present. To address these
challenges, we will harness recent advances in cryo-EM single particle analysis to investigate the structures
and dynamics of full-length photoreceptor kinases that share key mechanistic aspects with their prokaryotic
and eukaryotic counterparts. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the general principles of signaling and
allosteric regulation in modular receptor kinases by provoking and resolving functionally relevant structure
dynamics. Building on our expertise in photoreceptor research, we will take an integrated approach of
structural biology, biochemistry, and spectroscopy to tackle the molecular mechanisms of light-dependent
kinase activation in two representative bilin-based photoreceptors - a canonical bacteriophytochrome and a
dual-sensor photoreceptor kinase. Our supporting data have revealed light-induced global protein
reorganizations in both systems, demonstrating the feasibility of these studies. In this project, we will first
determine the full-length structures in different signaling states by resolving structural heterogeneity. We will
then establish the functional relevance of the resolved structures by comparing their population change
between datasets obtained under different light and ligand conditions. We will also dissect the motions in the
central helical spine while addressing the roles of dimer asymmetry and order-disorder transition in long-
range signaling via a joint analysis of conformational states captured by cryoEM and crystallography. Last but
not the least, we will employ complementary methods of mutagenesis and functional assays to interrogate key
interactions underlying the allosteric regulation and signal integration. Findings from the proposed studies
will provide unprecedented insights into the molecular events driving the allosteric actions in modular
receptor kinases beyond photoreceptors. Bilin-based photoreceptors are photo-switchable, spectrally versatile,
and modular in function. They hold great promise in diverse biomedical applications exploiting light to probe
cellular processes, modulate biological functions, and treat human diseases. Importantly, the mechanistic
understanding gained from these naturally occurring photoreceptors will lay the foundation for ultimately
engineering light-activated enzymes of desired signaling logic in novel therapeutic solutions via optogenetics."
10882682,"Project Summary
Individuals with lower limb amputations are at higher risk of falling compared to able-bodied and other clinical
populations and are more likely to sustain life-altering injuries. The higher fall risk is primarily due to the loss of
the muscles crossing the ankle, which are critical to maintaining balance control. Prosthetic devices are designed
to provide appropriate stiffness for needed stability and support. While research has shown the optimal stiffness
to maintain balance varies across ambulatory activities (e.g., straight walking versus turning), most clinically
prescribed prosthetic devices are passive and only provide a fixed stiffness level. The one commercially
available, powered prosthetic ankle-foot has not been shown to restore balance control. Thus, a prosthetic device
that actively adjusts ankle stiffness across different ambulatory activities is critically needed to advance the field
and improve balance control for those with lower-limb amputations. The goal of this project is to determine if
automatic stiffness modulation can improve the balance control of individuals with lower limb amputation as they
perform typical ambulatory activities of daily living. By matching the ankle stiffness to the task requirements, we
believe we will significantly improve balance control and decrease fall risk for those with lower-limb amputations.
In the proposed work, we will utilize an open source, lightweight, state-of-the-art hardware system (Open-Source
Ankle) that includes novel hardware, actuation, sensing, computation, and control software and pursue three
specific aims. In Aim 1, we will perform a human subject experiment to determine the influence of prosthetic
ankle stiffness on balance control during a wide range of ambulatory activities that will provide the basis for our
activity detection and stiffness modulation algorithms. In Aim 2, we will implement our activity detection and
phase-varying stiffness modulation algorithms into the Open-Source Ankle. We will use machine learning
techniques to predict different ambulatory activities and validate the ability of the Open-Source Ankle, fit with a
commonly prescribed low-profile prosthetic foot, to modulate the stiffness profile throughout the stance phase of
the different ambulatory activities. The outcome of this aim will be a semi-active prosthetic ankle-foot system
with activity-dependent, phase-varying, and user-specific mechanical stiffness profiles. In Aim 3, we will perform
a second human subject experiment to determine if automatic stiffness modulation improves balance control in
real-world environments. The outcomes of this research will provide insight into the relationships between
stiffness and balance and if a semi-active prosthetic system with automatic activity-dependent, phase-varying,
and user-specific stiffness modulation improves balance control for those with below-knee amputations. This
addresses a critical need in service member, veteran, and civilian populations with lower-limb amputations to
reduce their fall risk and injury incidence, which will ultimately improve their functional mobility, overall health,
and quality of life."

Unhealthy diets significantly contribute to major preventable chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes, obesity,
heart disease and stroke, which disproportionally impact racial/ethnic minority groups and those with lower
income.1–3 Key health organizations agree that policies are needed to support healthier diets, including ultra-
processed food and beverage taxes, nutrition warning labels, and marketing of healthier foods.4 Seven U.S.
cities have sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes, the FDA is currently considering a national front-of-package
food labeling system, and several U.S. cities have implemented or proposed healthy checkout regulations. It is
now well-established that SSB taxes substantially reduce SSB sales and intake5 and research indicates that
SSB nutrition warning labels can significantly reduce SSB purchases, though most of those data are from one-
time online or lab exposures.6–8 Although taxes and warning labels targeting SSBs have been successful at
shifting behavior, there are many other ultra-processed food products that contribute to unhealthy diets.9 What
is less well-known is whether a suite of healthy food policies that are expanded to target a range of ultra-
processed foods can shift dietary choices and intake in meaningful ways. To advance our understanding of
policies needed to support nutrition security and health, our overall objective is to examine the degree to which
a suite of healthy food policies in online food retailers can increase the purchase and intake of healthy foods and
beverages while reducing the purchase and intake of unhealthy ultra-processed foods and beverages. To
accomplish this objective, we propose using innovative online grocery store and restaurant platforms to
randomize participants to either: 1) control (no taxes, warning labels, or healthy checkout regulations on any
products); or 2) a suite of healthy food policies (ultra-processed food and beverage taxes, front-of-pack nutrition
labeling, and healthy check out regulations that restrict the promotion of ultra-processed products on the
checkout page). We will recruit 300 adults with lower income across Houston and San Antonio, TX, and
Philadelphia, PA to shop once per week for eight weeks in both our online grocery store and restaurant. Week
1 will be a baseline (control) week without interventions, followed by five weeks of the interventions. In the last
two study weeks, we will introduce unhealthy food marketing (e.g., banner ads) into the online platforms to mimic
what we expect industry will do to counter public health policy efforts. Participants will be given money to spend
in these online platforms and purchases will be delivered to them via a real food retail store and restaurant.
Participants will complete surveys at baseline, 6-weeks, and 8-weeks and will complete two dietary recall
interviews during the baseline week and during the fifth intervention week (4 recalls total). The specific aims are:
to evaluate the effects of three healthy food policies on purchases across online grocery store and restaurant
settings (Aim 1) and dietary intake (Aim 2). The goal of Aim 3 is to understand the degree to which unhealthy
food marketing counters the effects of the healthy food policies."

Children with cerebral palsy (CP) have a range of communication ability profiles. The majority have the speech
motor disorder, dysarthria, which almost always results in reduced speech intelligibility. Heterogeneity among
children with CP poses challenges for the study of speech and language development, necessitating the use of
prospective longitudinal methods wherein each child can serve as their own control. We began such work 15
years ago, following 90 children with CP, with the long-term goal of generating theoretically driven, empirically
validated, longitudinal models of speech and language development that can be used to predict outcomes,
guide treatment decisions, and test interventions for children with CP. To date, we have developed and
validated prospective, data-driven models of speech and language development, and created a clinical
speech-language profile group paradigm for children with CP. Our research has resulted in the first published
growth curves for speech intelligibility, and language comprehension, leading to the ability to predict later
speech and language outcomes with a high level of accuracy based on performance at only 3 years of age.
Our data have revealed that children with CP have a protracted developmental timeframe for the acquisition of
speech, with many still making intelligibility improvements through the age of 15 years. Despite major gains in
our understanding of speech and language development and in the application of this knowledge to clinical
decision making, progress is limited by two key barriers, addressed in this application: a.) The upper limits of
speech and language development after 15 years of age in CP have not been studied; therefore, we are
unable to generate comprehensive growth models that encompass all of development and include young adult
outcomes. b.) Treatment options for improving speech intelligibility in children with CP are limited and have
primarily focused on remediating speech subsystem deficits. Interventions focused on using augmentative and
alternative communication (AAC) strategies to supplement speech have not been examined in children, but
findings from adult CP studies are promising. In this renewal, we will collect new longitudinal data on our
existing cohort of youth with CP through the age of 20 years. We will also study 100 new children with CP in a
Phase I speech supplementation intervention study. Aims are: 1.)To quantify longitudinal change in speech
and language development between the ages of 2 and 20 years in children with CP. 2.)To develop and test
basic elements of a speech supplementation intervention to improve intelligibility in children with CP (Phase I
behavioral clinical trial). This work will complete the development and validation of longitudinal models of
speech and language growth in children with CP to 20 years of age. Results will enable the prediction of
outcomes for children with CP between 2 and 20 years, which will have direct implications for intervention
decision-making. Our Phase I intervention trial using speech supplementation strategies to improve
intelligibility in children with CP will lay the foundation for future Phase II and III clinical trials."

Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic condition and causes significant development delays and
weaknesses in the motor, cognitive, and language domains. About one half of infants with DS have congenital
heart defects (CHD), resulting in slower development in infants with DS and CHD (i.e., DS+CHD) than those
with DS without CHD (i.e., DS-CHD). Most of the earlier research used a cross-sectional design to compare the
two groups by focusing on the attainment of milestones. Understanding of the process of motor and language
skills (i.e., developmental trajectory) remains limited in infants with DS. The objectives of this proposal are to use
mobile technology (smart devices and secure cloud storage) to collect motor (sitting and arm movement) and
language (babbling) data in a home environment, employ computer vision software OpenPose to the motor data
and behavioral coding to the language data, and examine motor-language interrelation in infants with DS+CHD
and DS-CHD. Our central hypothesis is that sitting posture, rhythmic arm movement, and babbling are correlated
in infants with DS, and infants with DS+CHD will show delayed acquisition and higher variability of sitting posture,
rhythmic arm movement, and babbling, and a weaker motor-language interaction than those with DS-CHD. Aim
1: Validate mobile technology and computer vision in registering development trajectory of sitting posture and
rhythmic arm movement in infants with DS+CHD and DS-CHD from 6 to 15 months of age. We will recruit 36
infants aged 6 months with DS+CHD and DS-CHD (n=18 in each). We will train the parents to collect 5-minute
data of infant sitting and arm movement once a week using a provided iPad at their home. We will use OpenPose
(computer vision software for pose estimation) to analyze trunk position and rhythmic arm movement. We will
compare the trunk and arm data to that we collected from our monthly home visits to validate the application of
mobile technology and computer vision in infants with DS. We hypothesize that trunk and arm data obtained with
mobile technology and computer vision will serve as valid tools to register sitting posture and rhythmic arm
movement and that DS+CHD will show a later acquisition of trunk control and arm movement than DS-CHD. Aim
2: Characterize interrelation between motor and language skills in infants with DS. We will record 10 minutes of
parent-infant interaction at our monthly home visits to assess the emergence of babbling via behavioral coding.
We will conduct multiple linear regression analysis with covariates of participants’ characteristics to examine an
interaction between motor (trunk position and rhythmic arm movement) and language (babbling) in infants with
DS. Further, we will utilize functional data analysis (e.g., function-on-function linear regression) to investigate
interrelations (predictor and response) and causal effect of trunk position, rhythmic arm movement, and babbling.
We hypothesize that trunk position and arm movement are correlated with babbling, and DS+CHD will display
slower and more variable babbling acquisition and a weaker motor-language correlation than DS-CHD."
10874021,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a poorly understood structure of the mammalian forebrain that is
deeply involved in regulating complex behaviors such as sensory processing, attention, and sleep. TRN
dysfunction has been recently proposed to comprise a circuit endophenotype in neurodevelopmental
disorders, including autism, schizophrenia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Notably, a
specialized sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium (Ca2+) ATPase 2 (SERCA2)-dependent Ca2+-cycling network
operates in the dendrites of thalamic reticular neurons to regulate their burst-firing activity. Phospholamban
(PLN) is a critical regulator of the SERCA2, and well-known for preserving Ca2+ homeostasis in the heart.
Findings from our lab indicate that the role of PLN extends beyond the cardiovascular system to influence the
brain’s thalamic reticular neurocircuitry. Specifically, we have found PLN protein to be selectively expressed in
the inhibitory TRN neurons of the mouse brain, while conditional loss of PLN function in the TRN (i.e., PlncKO)
results in aberrant behaviors that map onto thalamic reticular circuits, including locomotor hyperactivity and
motor impulsivity. The studies outlined in the current 3-year AREA (R15) project will test the specific
hypotheses that: i) PLN is a prominent Ca2+-handling player in the TRN with an important role in regulating the
signaling properties of TRN neurons, and ii) that dysfunctional neuronal responses in the TRN underlie the
hyperactive and impulsive behavioral phenotypes observed in PlncKO mice. In order to address these
hypotheses, this project will use a combination of novel TRN-specific PlncKO transgenic mouse models, and
high-throughput RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) transcriptomics, neurochemical and in vivo Ca2+ fiber
photometry imaging approaches to unveil the intricate cellular and molecular mechanisms orchestrated by the
PLN/SERCA2 pathway in the TRN neurocircuit. The studies outlined in this proposal have high potential to
decipher the cellular and molecular dynamics of a novel thalamic reticular Ca2+-handling regulator involved in
fine-tuning locomotor activity and motor impulsivity at the organismal level. Importantly, this AREA (R15)
award will support a Neuroscience research team at the University of Dayton composed primarily of
undergraduate student researchers and will provide an outstanding opportunity for students to gain a solid
understanding of a wide spectrum of cutting-edge neuroscience methodologies. Over the project period, over
ten undergraduate students and one graduate student will be involved in the proposed research. Specialized
upper-level undergraduate Neurobiology laboratory courses (i.e., 20-24 students per year), as well as
introductory Biology core laboratory courses required by all science majors (i.e., 450 students per year) will
utilize antibodies, reagents, mouse models and experimental protocols developed in this project. This project
will therefore meet AREA (R15) goals by increasing scientific literacy of more than 1,400 students at the
University of Dayton through exposure to meritorious research."

This revised application seeks renewal for years 36-40 of a T32 program that will
provide training for 7 postdoctoral MD, PhD or MD/PhD scientists. The training
program is centered in the Department of Pathology and Immunology (P&I) at
Washington University in St. Louis, and consists of 36 training mentors who are
housed in 10 different departments. The training faculty consists of 16 women and
20 men and includes 2 URM. The faculty are a highly interactive group of
immunologists with interests in cancer immunology and cell/molecular cancer
biology and are led by a director and associate director who are well known for their
contributions to cancer immunology/immunotherapy and their commitment to
training of young scientists. The research of our faculty focuses on various aspects
of cancer immunology and immunotherapy with an emphasis on the molecular basis
of cellular activation and suppression. A Steering Committee of six T32 faculty
members oversees the training program and is responsible for the selection and
oversight of the trainees. We also formed a new external advisory board to obtain
outside opinions on our T32 program. Training includes a 2-to 3-year period of full-
time laboratory research, where the trainee is exposed to the latest approaches in
cancer immunology and cell and molecular cancer biology. The training also
includes presenting at laboratory meetings, participation in weekly seminars and
yearly retreats, training in research ethics and rigor and reproducibility, participation
in national/international meetings and opportunities to audit advanced courses in
Immunology, Cell Biology and Cancer Biology. During the most recent 10-year
funding period of this T32, 49 trainees were supported by the Program: 4 withdrew
for personal reasons and 7 trainees who had just started the program had their work
delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The remaining 38 trainees published 171
papers with 33 papers appearing in high impact journals and 76% of these trainees
had at least one first-author paper. Of the 70 trainees who have been or are
supported by this Program in the last 15 years, 66 (94%) have remained in research.
These demographics document the success of our T32 Training Program and
provide strong support for its competitive renewal."
10876332,"Project Summary/Abstract: The proposed research will study the mechanisms and structure-function
relationships of novel nitric oxide (NO)-dependent enzymatic activities with relevance to protein nitration,
natural product biosynthesis, and nitrosative stress protection in pathogenic bacteria. Exposure of cells to NO
results in cell damage including nitration of protein residues such as tyrosine (Tyr) and tryptophan (Trp).
Protein nitration can modulate protein function and are biomarkers of some neurodegenerative diseases.
Some protein nitration can be catalyzed by metal ions. The mechanisms of metal-mediated nitration pathways
are unclear; therefore, Research Direction 1 is to study the mechanisms of metal-catalyzed protein nitration.
To better understand these mechanisms, we will study the nitration by cytochromes P450 (CYPs), including
that of the enzyme TxtE, a CYP homolog that catalyzes the regiospecific and NO-dependent nitration of Trp to
4-nitrotryptophan (4-NO2-Trp). The observed regiospecificity suggests that diffusible RNS are not produced on
pathway. Furthermore, CYP metal-oxo intermediates have been well characterized. Therefore, studies of TxtE
have great potential to provide clear mechanistic data on nitration. One challenge is that TxtE nitration
intermediates are elusive. Therefore, the 5-year goal of Research Direction 1 is to determine the outer sphere
coordination features of TxtE needed to promote substrate nitration and avoid substrate hydroxylation, the
latter being canonical CYP activity. Identifying outer sphere interactions that influence TxtE reactivity will
provide structure-function insight to devise strategies to trap nitration intermediates. To avoid cell damage from
NO, pathogenic Mycobacteria express enzymes to scavenge NO. Research Direction 2 will study activities
and mechanisms of metalloenzymes involved in Mycobacterial virulence, including hemerythrin-like proteins
(HLPs) found in pathogenic Mycobacteria, including M. tuberculosis. Our preliminary data on HLPs shows that
its diferric oxidation state can oxidize NO to nitrite (NO2–) by reductive nitrosylation. Such reactivity is well
known for heme enzymes but has never been reported for a non-heme protein. In the presence of O2, HLP
reacts with NO to form nitrate (NO3–) and a metalloproduct with a 350-nm absorbance feature. This
metalloproduct can be independently generated by reacting the as isolated HLP with peroxynitrite (ONOO–).
The novel reactivities of HLP with RNS suggest a role for it in nitrosative stress protection. An uncommon Tyr
ligand bound to the HLP non-heme diiron site may facilitate these unusual reactivities. The 5-year goals of
Research Direction 2 are to trap and characterize intermediates of RNS reactions with HLP, determine the
catalytic activity of HLP, and identify the role of the Tyr ligand. The vision of our program is to discover novel
nitrogen biochemistries related to natural product biosynthesis and human health and to pursue engineering
biocatalysts and to establish a world-class training program in mechanistic metalloenzymology and protein
engineering, and natural product biosynthesis at UCF, a Hispanic-serving institution."
10876978,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Obesity is a significant public health concern among all racial/ethnic
groups, ages, gender, and geographic areas, but some groups are more disproportionately affected than others. Ethnic minority adolescents, especially AAs, are disproportionately likely to be obese relative to non-Hispanic White adolescents. The proposed study is designed to improve a comprehensive multicomponent family- based behavioral intervention (FIT Families) delivered by Community Health Workers (CHWs; therapists) for African American (AA) adolescents with obesity (AAAO). This application expands a program of research that has followed the Obesity Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) for developing behavioral treatments, by capitalizing on our recent work using innovative machine-learning (ML) models to thoroughly examine within-session therapy processes, specifically the role of CHW empathy in the development and maintenance of the therapeutic alliance (TA) while treating AAAO and their primary caregivers. TA is considered an essential element of therapy. The TA is composed of three features: 1. Emotional bond between therapist and client; 2. Agreement between the client and therapist on the goals of treatment; and 3. Agreement on the tasks of therapy. TA is a dynamic, bidirectional, and synergistic element of therapy with implications across differences in race, age, and gender of the client and therapist. Therapist empathy is critical in establishing and maintaining a strong TA, with outcomes mediated by the therapeutic alliance. Empathy accounts for more variance in therapy outcome than specific interventions and consistently predicts client change. Unfortunately, analysis of crucial facilitative interpersonal skills such as therapist empathy is technically challenging as the intent of another's behavior is nuanced, contextual (e.g., therapists and client differ in personality, background, cultural values, etc.), and interactive (bidirectional and synergistic); and can be expressed in multiple ways (voice tone, physiology]). To better understand empathy, especially in a cross-race context, requires empirical approaches and analytical tools that can discern empathetic behaviors in actual clinical encounters that produce behavior change. We will operationalize empathy through two measures that are each associated with empathy and treatment outcomes: 1) Empathic accuracy, defined as the CHW's accurate understanding of the client's state; and 2) Interpersonal physiological synchrony (IPS), defined as the correlation between therapist and client IPS over time (i.e., heart rate [HR], HR variability, galvanic skin response, voice features). This study uses these two empathy measures to understand the relationship between empathy, therapeutic alliance, and treatment outcomes. Further, the study will explore how empathy effects change based on the race and gender concordance/discordance of therapist-client dyads. Toward future clinical translation, the audio and physiological data collected will be used to build a M-L classification model for differing degrees of empathy. This model could then be used to provide real-time feedback for therapists training to improve their empathic responses."

 Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection,
encompasses a continuum that ranges from sepsis to severe sepsis, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction
syndrome (MODS) and eventually death if untreated. Sepsis is the leading cause of child mortality worldwide,
with most of these deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) yet few clinical tools have
been developed for identifying, monitoring, or managing septic children in LMICs. There is immense potential
for novel clinical tools that can help clinicians more rapidly identify children with advanced stages of
sepsis (severe sepsis, septic shock and MODS), who are at highest risk for decompensation and death.
Mobile health (mHealth) tools, wearable devices, and artificial intelligence techniques have rapidly proliferated
for a multitude of medical applications and could serve to bridge the gap in care of critically ill patients in
LMIC settings. By enabling the detection of subtle physiologic changes indicating clinical deterioration, these
tools may allow clinicians to intervene earlier, better direct care, and allocate scarce resources, all without the
need for advanced laboratory diagnostics or critical care infrastructure. Furthermore, remote monitoring
capabilities may also prove highly valuable in improving patient care and protecting the safety of healthcare
workers during times of infectious disease outbreaks such as from novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
 This proposed research will develop a context-appropriate mHealth tool linking continuous physiologic
data obtained from a wearable device with a novel machine learning approach known as personalized
physiologic analytics (PPA) run on a standard smartphone to provide clinicians with accurate assessments
of sepsis severity and mortality risk in septic children admitted to the Dhaka Hospital of the International
Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). Formative research among clinicians at icddr,b
will be used to develop this mHealth tool incorporating the PPA algorithm with a clinical decision support and
alert system for use by front-line clinicians. Finally, the tool’s feasibility, usability, and accuracy for detection of
sepsis severity and MODS will be validated in a new population of pediatric patients with sepsis.
 Knowledge gained from this study will greatly advance the evidence base for the use of mHealth tools and
artificial intelligence techniques to help clinicians worldwide better care for critically ill children in LMIC settings
earlier in the course of their disease, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality from sepsis. The results of
this investigational research will be used to inform a multi-center clinical trial which would seek to assess the
impact of using this mHealth tool on clinical outcomes as well as the cost-effectiveness of this tool. This tool
may also provide an effective means of assessing patient responses to various therapeutic interventions via
continuous physiologic monitoring in future clinical trials. The proposed initiatives will also build a base of
technical and professional expertise at icddr,b in mHealth research capacity and user-centered design."

Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetically defined cause of intellectual disability and a major cause
of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-type dementia. Recently, we concluded and published the results of a
randomized phase II trial of 16-week treatment with the AD drug memantine (the follow-up memantine trial) in
which we investigated the safety and efficacy of this drug on cognitive and adaptive test results in adolescents
and young adults with DS. This study was performed between May 13, 2015 and July 22, 2020. In total, 185
participants with Down syndrome were assessed for eligibility and 160 (86%) were randomly assigned either
memantine (n=81) or placebo (n=79), which makes it one of the largest clinical trials in the field of DS to date.
Participants (aged 15–32 years) with either trisomy 21 or complete unbalanced translocation of chromosome
21 and in general good health were recruited from the community at one site in Cleveland, Ohio, and another
in São Paulo, Brazil. Although the trial found no evidence of cognitive-enhancing effects of the standard dose
of memantine treatment in the study participants, hypothesis-generating, exploratory analysis in that work
pointed toward the need of memantine doses higher than those typically used in patients with AD to produce
significant cognitive-enhancing effects in healthy adolescents and young adults with DS. In addition to
information on drug effects, this study generated a comprehensive array of neuropsychological and clinical
data in a large and diverse set of individuals with DS. The trial protocol also included (as exploratory parallel
experiments) collection of evoked electroencephalographic (EEG) data to test auditory brainstem responses
and mismatch negativity before and after memantine treatment and quantification of plasma biomarkers of AD
at the final visit of the study. Here, we propose to perform analyses on the relationships between scores in the
various neuropsychological measures and the EEG and AD biomarker assessments and to share the de-
identified data with the community. Accordingly, this project has three specific aims: (1) Analyze the EEG and
plasma AD biomarker data generated in the follow-up memantine trial and study their relationship with scores
of neuropsychological assessments; (2) Build a comprehensive database of all clinical, neuropsychological,
electrophysiological, and biomarker data from the follow-up memantine trial; and (3) Contribute the database to
the NIH-funded INvestigation of Co-occurring conditions across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE
(INCLUDE) Project through the INCLUDE Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Transferring all the data collected
from the follow-up memantine trial will represent a significant contribution to Component 2 of the INCLUDE
project, which involves the “Assembly of a large cohort of individuals with Down syndrome across the lifespan
to perform deep phenotyping and study co-existing conditions.”"

Although over 75% of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are born in sub-Sahara where the disease highly contributes
to under-5 mortality and causes life-long debilitation, evidence-based strategies to control SCD are not widely
implemented in this region. Early detection of SCD by universal infant screening is a pillar of SCD control. Despite the
affordability and move to adopt point-of-care (POC) SCD screening assays in sub-Sahara Africa, the absence of screening
information management and communication systems (SIMCS) impedes standardized, systematic, coordinated,
nationwide SCD screening programs. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop a SCD SIMCS that will
enable universal SCD screening in the sub-Sahara African setting. The objective is to test and optimize a custom SCD
SIMCS app and digital network to facilitate SCD screening and then evaluate its impact on access to SCD screening and
care and on clinical outcomes of children with SCD in Uganda. The central hypothesis is that the SCD SIMCS will
facilitate accurate and coordinated POC SCD screening that is accessible at health centers in urban and rural Uganda. The
rationale is to build a custom SCD SIMCS on existing nationwide digital and health infrastructure in Uganda to
standardize use of the affordable HemoTypeSCTM POC assay at health centers nationwide. The central hypothesis will
be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Develop and evaluate a four-module ≥3G cell phone app for a novel SCD
SIMCS (R21 Phase); 2) Evaluate the impact of the SCD SIMCS on access to screening and care and outcomes of children
with SCD (R33 Phase). We will pursue these aims using an innovative combination of software design and re-organization
of SCD screening workflows. These include assembly of off-the-shelf software that is compatible with iOS and Android
operating systems to reliably, accurately, and handily capture, interpret, transmit, and retrieve/playback information for
patient’s IDs, test results, salient clinical events, and education. The novel screening workflows are expected to
dramatically reduce the cost and increase access to SCD screening and care. The proposed research is significant, because
it will determine how to use POC SCD screening assays on a large nationwide scale. It will also enable coordination of
evidence-based care and continuity of care between primary and specialist providers and longitudinally over the patient’s
lifetime – a critical aspect in controlling this life-long disease. The SCD SIMCS will also facilitate real time data
management for research and policy for SCD control. The expected immediate outcome of this research is a SCD SIMCS
that optimally functions on the digital and health infrastructure in Uganda and demonstration of its impact on access to
SCD screening and care and on clinical outcomes of children with SCD. The expected long-term outcome is that the SCD
SIMCS will be adopted, integrated, and scaled-up in the health systems of Uganda and other sub-Sahara Africa countries,
particularly those where the HemoTypeSCTM has already been adopted as the national standard of SCD screening. If
effective, the SCD SIMCS will have an important positive impact because it will reduce the cost of SCD screening, take
screening services and evidence-based care closer to rural communities where the majority of children in sub-Sahara
Africa live, and, ultimately, save millions of children from preventable and disability death."
10880498,"Progress in treating brain disorders has been frustratingly slow, in large part due to the extraordinary complexity of the
human brain and its inaccessibility to study. Remarkable advances in technologies for studying individual cells, most
notably single cell genomics, have revolutionized the study of complex nervous tissues and have been used to map cellular
diversity across the entire mouse brain with cell types defined by their specific patterns of gene usage and gene regulatory
mechanisms. These highly scalable methods have been successfully applied to brain tissue from human and other species
and are ready to be applied to whole brains from humans and non-human primates. A major challenge with studying the
human brain is bridging fields and scales from functional MRI and macroscale connectomics to histological, cellular and
molecular analyses. Bridging these domains is essential to creating a transformative new cell atlas that will describe the
cellular and molecular underpinnings of the functional organization of the human brain. An important recent
development from single cell genomic analysis is that cell types can be aligned across species and are highly conserved
across mammals from mice to humans, although more similar in evolutionarily closer primates than in rodents. This finding
amplifies the value of primate species in helping to understand human brains and infer cellular properties that cannot be
measured in humans.
The current proposal brings together a unique team of world leaders to tackle the challenge of creating a new human and
non-human primate cell atlas linked to functional brain architecture. Single cell transcriptomic, epigenomic and spatial
transcriptomics will be used to classify and spatially map cell types across the entire human, macaque and marmoset
brain, sampling based on brain maps derived from structural and functional imaging. Function-localizing fMRI in macaques
will allow the direct analysis of cellular correlates of functional topography. Advances in spatial transcriptomics will allow
an unprecedented whole primate brain map of cell types. Unique access to macaque tissues for analysis of cellular
anatomy and physiology allows the characterization of molecularly-defined cell types in many brain regions. Similar
techniques will be applied to living neurosurgically-derived human brain tissues, coupled with enhancer-AAV based tools
to allow selective genetic labeling of cell types. Finally, profiling regions central to perception, behavior and mood across
many individuals and diverse mammals will link genetic, environmental and evolutionary factors to cellular variation.
The outcome of these efforts will produce a new reference classification for cell types across the whole human and NHP
brain, spatial maps of molecularly defined cell types, and phenotypic characterization of fundamental brain cell types. The
classification will align homologous cell types from mice, marmosets, macaques and humans, allowing inference and
comparison of cellular properties across species. Furthermore, data will be aligned in common coordinate frameworks,
allowing creation of new atlases spanning structural, functional, cellular and molecular information. All data and analyses
will be distributed to the research community, including a formal cell ontology of cell types across species and visualization
tools for broad community access."
10879434,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity is a global epidemic that is associated with sympathetic overactivation, endothelial dysfunction, and
insulin resistance; all of which can contribute to hypertension development. Despite well-established clinical
associations, the mechanisms connecting obesity with hypertension remain poorly understood, with several
antihypertensive therapies eliciting detrimental metabolic effects. This illustrates the need to identify new
targets with a positive metabolic profile for treatment of obesity hypertension. We propose that angiotensin-(1-
7), a protective hormone of the renin-angiotensin system, provides this ideal target. In support of this concept,
we have shown that acute and chronic angiotensin-(1-7) treatment reduces cardiovascular sympathetic tone
and blood pressure and improves endothelial function and insulin sensitivity in obese mouse models. There is
limited clinical data, however, with no information on systemic effects of angiotensin-(1-7) on cardiovascular or
metabolic outcomes in any patient population including obesity hypertension. To address this critical gap, we
obtained preliminary data in obese hypertensive subjects suggesting that: circulating angiotensin-(1-7) levels
are reduced and negatively correlate with blood pressure; acute intravenous angiotensin-(1-7) infusion reduces
blood pressure and may increase endothelial-dependent vasodilation and decrease sympathetic tone; and
angiotensin-(1-7) may improve insulin sensitivity, findings consistent with the positive metabolic effects seen in
animal models. Based on these data, this proposal will test the central hypothesis that angiotensin-(1-7)
improves cardiovascular and metabolic-related derangements in obesity hypertension. We propose proof-of-
concept mechanistic studies to examine the cardiovascular and metabolic effects of acute intravenous
angiotensin-(1-7) infusion in obese hypertensive subjects. We will test hypotheses that angiotensin-(1-7) can:
reduce sympathetic activity and blood pressure; improve endothelial function; and increase whole-body insulin
sensitivity and insulin-mediated microvascular recruitment. A sub-study will also be performed in pure
autonomic failure patients lacking autonomic modulation of blood pressure to determine if angiotensin-(1-7)
blood pressure and vasodilatory effects are via direct actions on the vasculature versus indirect engagement of
autonomic mechanisms. Any results obtained from these studies will be novel and will increase mechanistic
understanding of the role of angiotensin-(1-7) in the etiology of obesity hypertension."
10882804,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and the most lethal primary malignant brain tumor. Immuno-
therapeutic strategies to promote an effective antitumor immune response hold great promise for GBM. Yet,
significant barriers remain as the factors that regulate the glioma-associated immune response, including the
microglia, macrophages, and T cells, are poorly defined. While GBM is broadly characterized by a lymphocyte-
depleted, immunosuppressive phenotype, there is a growing appreciation for the diversity of glioma immune
microenvironments. Data from our laboratory and others have identified RAF-driven glioma subtypes with
distinct immune-enriched phenotypes, including increased CD8 T cells, microglia, and macrophages. By
comparing immune-enriched and lymphocyte-depleted glioma subtypes, we have identified a novel role for the
chemokine CXCL14 in promoting a tumor-specific effector CD8 T cell response. Secreted by tumor cells,
CXCL14 promotes both T cell and macrophage chemotaxis. In this proposal, we investigate CXCL14 function
in glioma and directly test its potential to counteract the immunosuppressive microenvironment of GBM. To do
this we leverage our extensive collection of molecularly annotated human brain tumor samples, state-of-the-art
technologies, and murine models for GBM that mimic the characteristic lymphocyte-depleted tumor
microenvironment of human GBM."
10873862,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Epigenetics impacts all areas of cellular physiology, and epigenetic dysregulation is pervasive in human
disease. Given the inherent reversibility of epigenetic changes, this presents a great opportunity for the
discovery of novel therapeutics given the recent rapid development of epigenome-modifying drugs. Intriguingly,
large-scale human sequencing efforts have revealed that sun-damaged, but clinically otherwise normal human
skin, can harbor frequent mutations in epigenetic chromatin modifying enzymes. These include mutations that
have been typically observed in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), the second most common of all
human malignancies, and a major economic and public health burden. Recent data suggests that these
epigenetic mutations may be important drivers of malignant clone formation in the epidermis, provoking the
hypothesis that proper epigenetic function is required for both maintaining epidermal homeostasis and
preventing the initiation of carcinogenesis. Remarkably, despite the high incidence of both these mutations in
epigenetic modifiers and cSCC, the precise mechanisms by which disruption of chromatin modifying
enzymes drives the initiation of cSCC are virtually unknown. In this proposal, we will utilize multiple model
systems including human patient samples and a variety of transgenic mouse models, combined with several
innovative genome-wide and functional technologies in order to define the mechanistic links between
chromatin regulation, transcription, epidermal cell fate, and the initiation of epidermal carcinogenesis.
Collectively, these studies promise to inform both the development and utilization of epigenetic therapies in the
future."
10873864,"Project Abstract
Outdoor air pollution, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5; and its constituents) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), is
ubiquitous in urban areas and is a neurotoxicant. Emerging toxicological and epidemiological evidence suggests
that air pollution may contribute to increases in emotional behavioral problems and is linked to various mental
health disorders in children, adolescents, and adults. These recent findings have elucidated the need to: 1)
examine long-term effects of prenatal and childhood exposure; 2) identify pre-clinical neuroimaging biomarkers
of neurotoxicological effects in neural circuitry implicated in mental health risk; and 3) investigate these effects
in late-childhood and adolescence, as it is an opportune time to identify and intervene for those at risk for
psychiatric disorders. We propose the first longitudinal study to examine how prenatal and childhood air pollution
exposure impacts corticolimbic circuitry involved in emotion processing and regulation, and the onset of
internalizing and externalizing psychopathology during the transition from late-childhood to early adolescence.
Our hypothesis is that prenatal and childhood air pollution exposure contribute to increased risk for mental health
disorders during adolescence through alterations in corticolimbic neural circuitry and emotional development. To
test our hypothesis, the proposed project will create lifetime residential air pollution exposure estimates and
leverage comprehensive neuroimaging of corticolimbic neural circuitry, emotion, and mental health data, from a
multi-ethnic and geographically diverse cohort of 9- to 10-year-old children (N=11,873) enrolled in the nationwide
longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Using multi-modal neuroimaging, we will
elucidate the effects of prenatal and childhood air pollution exposure on changes in the structure (Aim 1) and
function (Aim 2) of corticolimbic circuitry underlying emotional processing and regulation from late-childhood to
early adolescence. In Aim 3, we will examine how prenatal and childhood air pollution exposure influences the
development of emotional problems and subsequent risk for mental health disorders by using both: a)
dimensional scales and b) mental health diagnostic criteria (based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders). As an exploratory sub-aim, we will also examine a potential mediation of corticolimbic alterations at
9-10 yrs in the link between air pollution exposure during development and subsequent risk for internalizing and
externalizing psychopathology at ages 11-12 yrs. This study is primarily focused on long-term prenatal and
childhoodPM2.5 and NO2 exposure; however, we also plan to explore differential timing effects of these exposures
as well as the potential neurotoxic effects of other ambient pollutants (i.e. ozone, PM components). The large,
sociodemographic and geographic diverse sample of children from ABCD are at an opportune age to evaluate
pre-clinical markers of psychopathology. This provides great promise for more robust and generalizable findings
that have the potential to impact policy as well as identify early neuroimaging biomarkers as targets for early
intervention."
10873968,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Even with an ever-expanding arsenal of active drug molecules validated in vitro, ensuring these reach their
desired target in the body, while at the same time limiting toxic exposure in healthy tissue, remains a challenge.
Routes for targeting drugs using antibodies or targeted carriers still result in less than 1% of drug arriving at the
site of need. Molecular-scale targeting may have inherent advantages relative to these approaches due to more
extensive tissue distribution and more rapid clearance of unbound attenuated therapeutic agents, leading to more
drug arriving at the site of need or clearing prior to onset of systemic toxicity. Routes using `click' chemistry and
related covalent ligations have been explored for homing drugs to pre-targeted sites. Here, we describe our
progress and plans in developing a versatile and modular molecular-scale approach that uses synthetic non-
covalent affinity to home drugs to desired sites in the body. Relative to covalent molecular-scale approaches, the
chemistry we use has faster kinetics of association and also enables future reuse of the targeted site. Through
prodrug methodology, we have shown that drugs of interest can be modified with affinity motifs through labile
linkers, to be recognized at desired tissue sites by the presence of a corresponding binding partner. Serial re-
dosing of these sites, or the possibility to temporally change the drug delivered, adds further benefit to our
modular non-covalent approach. With this proposal, we seek to further define this research program and more
fully capture the benefits of non-covalent recognition relative to `click'-based alternatives. Specifically, we will
elucidate the importance of prodrug design and pharmacokinetic properties. So as to enable serial re-targeting of
a drug site – a distinct benefit of non-covalent recognition – we will explore new chemistry for in situ immolation to
lower-binding variants. We will also explore this approach in overcoming common physiologic barriers to the
administration of protein and small molecule therapeutics, using the systemic administration of innocuous agents
to trigger the release of therapeutic compounds bearing affinity tags from locally applied depots. Finally, to
expand the therapeutic scenarios wherein this targeting route may be useful, we will explore this affinity axis for
integration with metabolically engineered cells. In summary, we are optimistic that the new targeting technology
we are developing will unlock the vast therapeutic potential of active agents which are presently limited by
systemic toxicity or poor target localization. A platform such as that we are pursuing would have broad application
in therapeutic delivery for the treatment of a variety of diseases or for remote intervention in implanted biomedical
device practice."
10873812,"ABSTRACT: Background: Postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) are the most common surgical complications in older adults and are associated with increased hospital length of stay, functional disability, mortality, and risk of Alzheimer’s. In the U.S., anesthesia is maintained with inhalational agents (GAS) in up to 90% of operations; however, maintenance with intravenous agents (IV) is an alternative technique with potential advantages. There is a significant gap in knowledge regarding whether IV vs. GAS can decrease the risk of deleterious postoperative outcomes in older surgical patients. This is a critical public health problem considering over half of older Americans will undergo surgery during their lives, and the surgical population is aging faster than the U.S. population. Considering both GAS and IV are readily available, effective, safe, and cost-effective, switching from one to the other would be a simple clinical practice change. Career Development Plan: The candidate is dedicated to an academic career in perioperative aging research and will focus on four objectives. (1) Training to become a clinical trialist and lead multidisciplinary teams conducting trials in older adults. Develop expertise in incorporating (2) geriatric medicine principles and (3) biomarker investigations into perioperative intervention trials in older adults. (4) Enhance leadership training to be an effective leader in geriatric anesthesiology research and effect change in clinical practice. Objectives will be met by formal coursework, meetings, seminars, mentoring, skills training, and experiential learning with a dedicated mentorship team in a supportive academic department and institution. Completion will enable the candidate to achieve the goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist and a leader in geriatric anesthesia research focused on preventing neurocognitive and functional decline in older surgical patients. Research Proposal: The specific aims are to determine the effects of IV vs. GAS on (1) incidence of POD and POCD in older adults; (2) incidence of postoperative functional decline and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in older adults; and (3) levels of phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) and other blood biomarkers in older adults. Hypotheses: There is a decreased incidence of POD, POCD, and functional decline following surgery and general anesthesia with IV vs. GAS. Next, compared to GAS, IV will improve PROs and decrease neuroinflammatory and Alzheimer’s blood-based biomarkers. Specifically, the postoperative increase in blood p-tau181 is greater in GAS than IV and is associated with POD and POCD. Approach: This single-center, 1:1 randomized, double-blind clinical trial will compare GAS vs. IV on POD, POCD, functional status, and PROs in men and women ≥ 75 years of age undergoing elective, inpatient, non-cardiac surgery. Results will provide evidence to aid the choice of general anesthetic (IV vs. GAS) to optimize outcomes in geriatric surgical patients. This aligns with the NIA’s strategic goal to develop effective interventions to maintain health, well-being, and function, and reduce the burden of age-related disorders and disabilities."
10873918,"SUMMARY
 From insects to mammals, seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) significantly affect the reproductive physiology of
mated females, the storage and release of sperm inside females, and (in mice) even the phenotype of
progeny. Males abnormal for specific Sfps are sterile or subfertile, including in humans. Some Sfps bind tightly
to sperm; others are free in seminal plasma. Yet despite their importance in reproduction, little is known about
exactly how Sfps act to influence the female or the behavior of sperm in females. Importantly, many Sfps
evolve rapidly, consistent with roles in molecular/evolutionary sexual conflicts. Understanding functional
constraints on the evolution of Sfps and the proteins with which they interact in females will guide future
investigations into Sfp actions in human fertility.
 We will combine molecular genetic and functional approaches to investigate: (1) how Sfps interact with
female molecules to elicit reproductive responses and (2) how Sfps associate with sperm to mediate their
effects, as well as how both types of function have evolved. We will investigate these questions using
Drosophila, a premier genetic model system for dissecting Sfp function, with extensive resources for
evolutionary comparisons. Importantly, Drosophila Sfps have many molecular and phenomenological parallels
to those of mammals.
 Aim 1 focuses on ovulin, which stimulates ovulation by inducing neuronal octopaminergic signaling.
This signaling regulates muscle contraction in the female reproductive tract, relaxing the oviducts and
increasing ovulation rate. Using genetic screens and signatures of protein-protein coevolution, we have
identified strong candidates for the female’s receptor for ovulin (OvR). We will test these for ovulin binding and
then determine OvR localization, to pinpoint the site of ovulin action. We will then examine how well different
species’ ovulins mediate ovulin action and OvR binding, to elucidate the evolution of their function.
 In Aim 2 we will focus on seminal proteins that bind to sperm, which we have identified by their coevolution
or by proteomic methods. Our recent data show that Sfps prime sperm for binding to the critical Sfp called Sex
Peptide. We will ask which seminal proteins function within this priming pathway and which act independently
of that pathway. We will also investigate whether female secretions are also involved in priming. Finally, we will
determine the extent to which the functions of a subset of sperm-bound Sfps are conserved across related
Drosophila species.
 Elucidating how Sfps interact with and affect the female at the molecular level, as well as how these
interactions evolve, is important for understanding and diagnosing Sfp-based infertilities, in considering
strategies for assisted reproductive technologies that would benefit from inclusion of critical Sfps, and for
developing new ways to control dipteran insects that transmit serious diseases like dengue, Zika, and malaria."
10873919,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aging is associated with negative effects on the skeletal system, leading to impaired bone health, increased
frailty, and risk of musculoskeletal disorders. However, our current understanding of the mechanisms by which
aging affects skeletal health is limited. Osteocytes are the most numerous and long-lived cells in bone and play
key roles in maintaining bone mass by responding to anabolic signals such as mechanical loading. This response
to loading is impaired in aged bone, by unknown mechanisms, leading to derangements in bone homeostasis.
Energy metabolism is disrupted in many cells and tissues with aging, however regulation of energy metabolism
in osteocytes and how this is affected during aging and by mechanical loading remains undefined. Our
preliminary findings have identified that anabolic mechanical loading regulates energy metabolism in osteocytes
in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, fatty acid β-oxidation is upregulated in response to strain, as are the key
promoters of β-oxidation, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (Pparδ) and carnitine
palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1). Deletion of Pparδ in osteocytes in vivo inhibited β-oxidation and decreased bone
mass in female mice but not males. Furthermore, β-oxidation is decreased in aged mouse bone compared to
young animals, and pharmacological activation of PPARδ in aging mice improves bone health. These findings
suggest important functions of osteocyte energy metabolism, and β-oxidation in particular, in the effects of aging
and mechanical loading on bone.
In this proposal, we will determine the role of osteocyte β-oxidation in the response to mechanical stimulation
and the maintenance of bone health with aging. For these studies, we have generated mice with targeted deletion
of Pparδ in osteocytes and will use these mice and ex vivo isolated osteocytes from young and aged mice to
determine the function of β-oxidation in osteocytes. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of osteocyte β-oxidation
in regulating bone health in young and aged mice. In Aim 2, we will determine how aging affects the metabolic
response of osteocytes to mechanical loading and the role of PPARδ-driven β-oxidation in this process. In Aim
3, we will examine whether activation of PPARδ to increase β-oxidation in osteocytes can improve bone health
in aged mice.
The findings from the proposed studies will markedly increase the knowledge of osteocyte energy metabolism
and define the role of PPARδ-driven β-oxidation in osteocytes and its function during aging and under
mechanical loading."
10873921,"Project Summary/Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small (18-24 nucleotide) RNAs that are essential regulators of gene expression,
which act within the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to bind mRNAs and suppress translation. Alterations
in miRNA expression have been shown to disrupt entire cellular pathways, substantially contributing to a variety
of human diseases. Despite nearly 25 years of research, miRNAs remain dicult to measure due to their short
length, relatively small number, sequence similarity, and diculty to isolate from other small RNA fragments.
While qPCR- and microarray-based miRNA assays are still widely used, the majority of recent studies use small
RNA-seq (sRNA-seq) because it allows for the quanti cation of isomiRs (miRNA isoforms) and the possibility of
identifying novel miRNAs. The processing of reads generated from sRNA-seq data globally distinguish between
miRNA reads and those from other small RNAs, but do not necessarily capture the full spectrum of miRNA
variation. Subsequent statistical analyses of processed sRNA-seq data are still performed using methods developed
for mRNA-seq data despite the fact that sRNA-seq data violate several of the assumptions of these methods.
Speci cally, methods for mRNA-seq data assume approximate independence between feature counts; however,
the small total number of miRNAs and presence of a small number of very highly expressed miRNAs result in a
lack of independence between miRNA counts. Additionally, normalization methods for mRNA-seq data assume
either the overall level of transcription is constant across samples or an equal number of features are over- and
under-expressed when comparing any two samples, neither of which hold for sRNA-seq data. The development of
statistical methods that address the challenges of sRNA-seq data represents a critical need for miRNA research.
 Our long-term goal is to advance miRNA research by developing statistical methods that are tailored to
the speci c complexities of miRNA expression data. The overall objective of this application is to improve the
analysis of sRNA-seq data by developing statistical methods that account for challenges speci c to sRNA-seq data
and outperform methods designed for mRNA-seq data. This addresses an urgent need for statistical methods
to appropriately analyze sRNA-seq data, which are now routinely generated by large consortia such as TCGA
and FANTOM. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that methods that explicitly address the
challenges inherent in measuring miRNAs are necessary to fully elucidate the role miRNAs play in many human
disease processes."

The Texas A&M University Superfund Research Center aims to characterize and manage both existing and
environmental emergency-created hazardous waste sites through the development of tools that can be used by
first responders, affected communities, and government bodies involved in site management and cleanup. The
complexities of hazardous chemical exposures that occur as a result of environmental emergencies, their
potential adverse health effects, and the need to rapidly and comprehensively evaluate and mitigate the potential
hazards of exposures to complex mixtures call for a highly interdisciplinary and cohesive research program. The
Center brings together a team of scientists from biomedical, engineering, data science, and social disciplines to
design comprehensive solutions for complex exposure- and health hazard-related risk assessment and hazard
reduction challenges. Given the diversity of the disciplines involved, the excellence of the investigators, and the
tight integration of the fundamental and applied research, the Center will form an outstanding training
environment for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows and will create ample opportunities for integration
and professional development of the next generation of researchers and practitioners. The Research and
Experience Training Coordination Core (RETCC) will serve as a central hub for science and practice learning in
the Center by focusing on the following objectives: (1) Promote interdisciplinary learning via collaborative projects
across multiple Projects/Cores; (2) Augment trainees’ existing graduate and postdoctoral programs with targeted
skill-building workshops; (3) Provide opportunities for interactions with diverse audiences (scientific and
layperson) in support of the research translation functions of the Community Engagement and Administrative
and Research Translation Cores; and (4) Track and evaluate trainee development and success. The Core will
work closely with existing training programs at participating institutions and will be tightly integrated with the
Interdisciplinary Faculty of Toxicology and T32 program, “Regulatory Science in Environmental Health and
Toxicology,” at Texas A&M University. The Core will coordinate research and learning of postdoctoral fellows
and doctoral students in all Projects and Cores. Distinctive features of the Core are topic-specific inter-
disciplinary boot camps and a trainee exchange program across Center components or with outside stakeholders
involved in emergency response to environmental disasters, modelled after the KC Donnelly Externship Award.
These activities receive support from Texas A&M administration. It is expected that Center trainees will continue
to be highly successful in academia, industry, governmental agencies and other professional settings and will
improve public health protection through innovative and rigorous research and practice in support of decision-
making."

The Texas A&M University Superfund Research Center aims to develop descriptive models and tools that can
predict the possible hazardous outcomes of chemical exposure during environmental emergencies while
providing powerful solutions that can mitigate their negative effects on human health. The Data Management &
Analysis Core (DMAC) is one of the key components of the Center that will support all projects and cores in their
data management, analysis, quality control needs. Directed by Dr. Efstratios N. Pistikopoulos and in collaboration
with co-Investigators Dr. Fred A. Wright, Dr. Lan Zhou, and Dr. Candice Brinkmeyer-Langford, the DMAC will
provide a number of essential services to the Center’s researchers by assisting them is achieving key
environmental and biomedical outcomes under four specific aims: (i) providing a new platform for data
management and sharing across the Center, (ii) applying best-practice analysis methods to Center data, (iii)
developing new methods that are urgently needed to solve the problems posed in the Projects, and (iv)
maintaining research and data quality control protocols for the Center. The DMAC will establish a data universe
(“dataverse”) for data sharing, integration, and collaboration. The “dataverse” will be used to manage Center
datasets where each component will securely deposit and access data through a web-based platform and ensure
Center generated data comply with Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles. The
DMAC will also provide additional assistance in developing and utilizing advanced data science methodologies
for translating raw experimental data into actionable insights and predictive models for all projects. Project 1 will
perform and optimize ion mobility spectrometry and mass spectrometry analyses of complex environmental
samples; DMAC will provide guidance on geospatial sampling, feature selection, and classification analysis.
Project 2 will develop in vitro pediatric lung model to characterize respiratory risks from VOCs; DMAC will perform
concentration-response modeling, nonlinear, and spatial modeling techniques to evaluate the respiratory risks
from ambient VOCs. Project 3 will address pregnancy risk implications of exposures to hazardous substances
by developing a feto-maternal interface organ-on-a-chip model; DMAC will provide expertise in hypothesis
testing, regression analysis, and ANOVA testing for analyzing proinflammatory cytokine measures. Project 4 will
utilize in vitro cultures and reverse toxicokinetic analysis to characterize hazards of environmental mixtures;
DMAC will provide service in analyzing high-content screening data, high-throughput transcriptomics data, and
will perform population variability analyses. Project 5 will study the mitigation of adverse health effects of

The Texas A&M University Superfund Research Center is investigating the impacts of environmental
emergency-related contamination events across the source-to-outcome continuum, including exposure, human
health hazard, and mitigation of contamination and toxicity. In order to achieve the Texas A&M Superfund
Research Center’s ultimate goal of improving decision-making after an environmental emergency, the Center’s
Projects and Cores will need to make their findings interpretable to first responders, impacted communities, and
government bodies involved in site management and cleanup. Therefore, the entire Center will be supported by
a Risk and Geospatial Sciences Core (RGSC), which has expertise in synthesizing, mapping, and visualizing
relevant scientific data and conclusions for use by those involved in decisions related to risk management. The
overall objective of the Risk and Geospatial Sciences Core is to provide the Center with data and services for
characterizing human health risks and the geographic distribution from environmental mixtures created during
disasters, thereby supporting the cohesion, relevance, and implementation of project findings in the context of
environmental decision-making. Our work will facilitate interaction among Center projects, while also serving as
a bridge to the Disaster Research Response, Community Engagement, and Administration and Research
Translation Cores. Key services provided will include human health risk assessment (Aim 1), geospatial data
and analysis (Aim 2), and application to disaster research planning, sampling, and interpretation (Aim 3). In Aim
1, human health risk modeling will be used to make inferences about hazard or risk in the human population
based on experimental or observational data, serving as an essential bridge between scientific data and
environmental policy decisions. In the context of Superfund, human health risk modeling is used to demonstrate
that exposure standards or environmental remediation decisions both protect human health and reduce toxicity
or risk. In Aim 2, geospatial data and analysis will be utilized to address the complex spatiotemporal dynamics
of environmental emergency-related contamination, providing essential geographical contextualization and
visualization to inform decision-making. In Aim 3, the Core will provide both risk and geospatial expertise to
support rapid mobilization and sampling, as well as timely and decision-relevant interpretation, coordinated by
the Disaster Research Response Core. As a whole, these services will support the Center’s overall goal by
helping to interpret and translate research project findings into information that can be used by varied
stakeholders, from communities to federal and state decision-makers, to assess the human health impact of
contaminant exposures after an environmental emergency, and enhance the planning, emergency response, as
well as long-term recovery and remediation efforts related to environmental disasters."
10874517,"The proteomics and lipoprotein characterization core (Core B) will provide the powerful tools of modern
mass spectrometry and complex data set analysis to Program Project Grant (PPG) investigators. The Core will
also provide lipoprotein isolation, and measurements of lipoprotein particle concentration and size using
calibrated ion mobility analysis. The Core will permit structural identification and quantitation of lipoproteins
including remnant lipoprotein particles (RLPs), as well as VLDL, LDL and HDL, and measurement of
lipoprotein particle number of these lipoprotein classes using calibrated ion mobility analysis.
Core personnel are proficient in liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-MS/MS analysis (shotgun
proteomics) of complex biological mixtures of proteins, with a particular emphasis on the lipoprotein proteomes
and on the quantification of their protein cargo using targeted LC-MSMS analysis. The Core Director
established precise methods for quantitation of HDL proteome and applied them to quantification of the HDL
proteome in large translational studies and will apply the same methods to other lipoprotein classes through
Core B. The unique calibrated ion mobility analysis method measures HDL particle number and 5 subspecies
of HDL particles, as well as proatherogenic particles like RLPs, and small dense LDL. We anticipate that all
investigators will take advantage of these capabilities.
In addition to providing instrumental capabilities and bioinformatics tools, Core B staff will provide consultation
and collaboration on the application of mass spectrometry and lipoprotein particle concentration measurements
to the Program Project, and integration and analysis of complex datasets. This will include development of new
analytical methods targeted at achieving the research objectives of the Program’s investigators.
Core B will optimize the efficiency and cost-effectiveness through which these services are provided to PPG
investigators by providing a central laboratory. This avoids the need for individual PPG investigators to
maintain the required instrumentation in their own laboratories, avoids the high cost of commercial mass
spectrometric services, and will ensure consistency between analyses for different project sites (Seattle, St.
Louis, and New York). By centralizing and standardizing procedures, Core B will provide a common set of
analytical tools that will lead to a unified understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in the physiologic
and pathophysiologic processes of diabetic vascular disease."
10874518,"Disaster Research Response (DR2) Core ABSTRACT
The overall theme of the Texas A&M University Superfund Research Center is to develop, apply, and translate
a comprehensive set of tools and models that will aid in mitigating the human health consequences of exposure
to hazardous mixtures during environmental emergency-related contamination events. In the past funding period
(since 2017), the Center responded to a number of disasters to collect samples and respond to concerns from
community partners, non-governmental organizations, and local and state agencies. Activities included sampling
of water, sediment, and soils in response to Hurricane Harvey (2017), Hurricane Florence (2018), and the large-
scale industrial fire at the Intercontinental Terminals Company (ITC) facility (2019). Sampling was conducted to
establish both spatial and temporal dimensions of the extent of re-distribution of hazardous substances in the
environment that may impact human health. While several of the Texas A&M University Superfund Research
Center’s projects and cores have contributed to these efforts and provided sampling supplies, field personnel,
training, and quality assurance/control (QA/QC) documentation, we now propose to establish a dedicated service
core for these activities. Therefore, this new DR2 Core will support the Center, and the rigor and reproducibility
of its DR2 activities, by ensuring the Center’s ability to respond to disasters through creation of a centralized
resource to support DR2 infrastructure, methods, supplies, and training. The central hypothesis of the DR2 Core
is that the rigor and reproducibility of DR2 activities will be ensured and the Center’s ability to respond to future
disasters with translational research will be improved by creating a centralized resource and infrastructure to
support disaster research response encompassing environmental assessment capabilities that can be rapidly
deployed anywhere. The DR2 Core responds to Superfund mandate (3), the development of methods and
technologies to detect hazardous substances in the environment, and will focus on four specific Aims. First, the
DR2 Core will maintain sampling supplies, field and laboratory equipment, and instrumentation required for
collection of environmental samples during and after disasters. Second, the DR2 Core will coordinate collection,
processing, and storage of environmental samples. Third, this Core will facilitate DR2 activities by the projects
and cores and integrate with NIH DR2 programs. Finally, the DR2 Core will ensure that Center personnel can
conduct fieldwork safely and properly for baseline sampling and in response to disasters. Overall, the efforts of
the DR2 Core will specifically enhance interactions among Center projects and other cores, increasing their
impact by ensuring alignment of measured/human/test system exposures from real-life environmental samples
and increasing the translation of basic science in decision making, translation, and community engagement."
10874522,"Both type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS; also
known as pre-diabetes) increase the risk of atherosclerosis, the leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
events and death in diabetic patients. Even with statin treatment to effectively lower LDL cholesterol, diabetes
is associated with increased CVD risk linked to abnormal metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs)
and their remnant lipoprotein particles (RLPs). Novel strategies to enhance TRL clearance have therefore
recently generated significant interest, especially in the setting of diabetes. This application uses three
strategies to increase TRL and RLP clearance in diabetes; i) inhibition of apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3), ii)
inhibition of angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3), and iii) hepatic expression of an active form of the transcription
factor CREB-H (cAMP response element-binding protein H). The proposed studies build on strong preliminary
data demonstrating that diabetes accelerates progression of advanced lesions and that normalizing circulating
levels of TRLs prevents atherosclerosis in diabetic mice. Furthermore, diabetes causes increased macrophage
death associated with accumulation of cellular cholesterol and caspase 11 activation, which we hypothesize
contributes to the more advanced atherosclerotic lesion phenotype. Collectively, our observations support the
following hypothesis: Diabetes accelerates advanced atherosclerosis by increasing APOC3 and
associated TRLs and RLPs, which in turn induce macrophage lipid loading and exacerbate the death of
macrophages by pyroptosis. Such a mechanism could help explain the increased CVD risk in subjects with
diabetes. The first specific aim will address whether APOC3-enriched TRLs/RLPs are required for diabetes-
mediated atherosclerosis progression. We propose to test this hypothesis and to clarify the role of APOC3 by
normalizing plasma APOC3 and/or TRL/RLP levels in mouse models of T1DM and MetS/T2DM by three
distinct approaches; the use of an Apoc3 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), an Angptl3 ASO, which reduces
TRLs and other lipoproteins independent of hepatic Apoc3 expression, and hepatic expression of CREB-H,
which lowers TRLs without affecting total plasma levels of APOC3. Contrasting the effects of these treatments
will provide new insights into the role of APOC3 versus TRL/RLP lowering. The second specific aim will
determine whether pyroptosis mediated by APOC3-enriched TRLs/RLPs contributes to lesional macrophage
death and advanced lesions in diabetes. We propose to mechanistically test the importance of this pathway by
using mice deficient in caspase 11 and gasdermin D, its downstream effector, in myeloid cells. We also expect
that pyroptosis will be prevented by TRL-lowering in diabetic mice. The in vivo studies will be complemented by
mechanistic studies in macrophages to clarify the pathways responsible in diabetes-induced macrophage
death, and by studies addressing mechanisms whereby reduced insulin receptor signalling leads to increased
levels of APOC3 in models of T1DM and MetS/T2DM."
10874523,"Human genetic, epidemiologic, and randomized clinical trial data suggest that therapies that independently
lower LDL-C and TRLs reduce the risk of CVD. Inhibiting ANGPTL3 recently emerged as a novel therapeutic
approach for reducing both LDL-C and TRLs, which, unlike other lipid-lowering therapies, may protect against
diabetes because ANGPTL3-deficient subjects have improved insulin sensitivity. However, the complete
metabolic consequences of inhibiting ANGPTL3 in humans and the cellular mechanisms responsible for the
cardiometabolic protective effect of ANGPTL3 deficiency remain unknown. In that context, Project 2’s aims will
define the role of ANGPTL3 in lipid and glucose metabolism. Aim 1 will determine how ANGPTL3 deficiency
alters lipoprotein and glucose metabolism in humans, using in vivo tracer kinetic studies in controls and in a
previously recruited family with participants who have either single or biallelic ANGPTL3 loss of function
mutations. We will determine how ANGPTL3 deficiency alters fasting and postprandial plasma lipoprotein
particle number, size, and composition in addition to adipose tissue and skeletal muscle transcriptional
programs related to glucose metabolism. Aim 2 will use subject-specific iPSCs from humans with complete
ANGPTL3 deficiency along with corrected isogenic control iPSCs to determine the cellular mechanisms linking
ANGPTL3 with lipoprotein (including RLP) and glucose metabolism. Unlike the therapeutic targets of APOB
(mipomerson) and MTTP (lomitapide), ANGPTL3 deficiency appears to reduce hepatic VLDL secretion without
leading to hepatic steatosis. In addition, unlike other approved LDL-lowering therapies (statins, PSCK9
inhibitors, etc), ANGPTL3 deficiency appears to reduce LDL cholesterol without worsening risk for T2DM.
Together, these observations suggest that ANGPTL3 may be working through novel intracellular and
extracellular pathways that are yet to be discovered which collectively modulate lipoprotein and glucose
metabolism. The studies outlined here are poised to discover these cellular mechanisms which hold the
promise to expand our understanding of human biology and identify additional therapeutic targets for the
treatment of dyslipidemia while improving glucose levels."
10880930,"Project Summary/Abstract
Schizophrenia is a debilitating disorder that affects over two million individuals in the United States alone1.
Despite the burden placed on society and the individuals who suffer from this common and multifaceted disorder,
we have a limited understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of its broad range of symptoms.
Dyscoordination of sensory and cognitive processes in schizophrenia may be a fundamental pathology that
underlies many cognitive and behavioral impairments2,3 and cuts across the schizophrenia spectrum2,4,5.
Impairments in perceptual processes that rely on the coordination of sensory, cognitive, and motor systems,
such as time estimation6–10, sequence learning11,12, and rhythmic stimulus processing13, have been linked to
dysfunction in cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) and cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) circuits, which are
integral to the internal representation of temporal patterns14,15. Broad thalamocortical systems-level dysfunction
in schizophrenia has garnered attention in the last decade16, with increasing evidence that CSTC excitability is
decreased while CTC excitability is increased17. The identification of neuroanatomical and/or neurophysiological
alterations in these circuits early in the disorder may inform future treatment interventions for schizophrenia.
Based on published research and our extensive pilot data showing feasibility and scientific premise, we
hypothesize hypoexcitability of CSTC systems and hyperexcitability of CTC systems within one year of the first
episode of schizophrenia-spectrum psychosis (FESz). We posit that dyscoordination of timing and sequencing
systems is reflected in alterations of beta-band neural activity and connectivity, evoked response amplitudes,
and white matter structural abnormalities in CSTC and CTC systems, and that this dyscoordination is related to
aberrant perceptual organization, negative symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction. Thus, we propose a series of
multimodal experiments in FESz and healthy controls to investigate both structure and function of CSTC and
CTC timing systems. We will utilize neurophysiological measures of auditory perception measured with
electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) to experimentally compare functional/task-
related activity/connectivity, and we will use diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) to examine structural connectivity.
Elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying this pathophysiology is critical for understanding and potentially
reducing these debilitating symptoms in schizophrenia. This study represents a great step toward that goal by
delving deeply into the structure and function of CTC and CSTC timing systems in FESz."
10880932,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major respiratory pathogen in the pathogenesis of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and the
ineffective immune response to this pathogen is thought to cause the majority of the lung damage characteristic
of this disease. In the later stages of CF, P. aeruginosa reside in biofilm communities in the lung, accounting for
their resistance to antibiotic therapies. To date, little is known about host factors that promote the transition of P.
aeruginosa from acute to chronic infection in CF. CF patients show a reduced ability to clear P. aeruginosa
acquired during respiratory viral infections and frequently new pseudomonal colonization in people with CF
follows a respiratory viral infection. We have shown that virus co-infection, and the subsequent antiviral interferon
response, promote biofilm conversion by P. aeruginosa. Interferon has potent antiviral activity, but in addition,
interferon stimulated gene (ISG) effector functions have been reported to promote pathogen replication,
suggesting that pathogens have evolved to subvert and even benefit from the interferon response. Decades of
research demonstrate metabolic reprogramming as part of the host response to acute viral infections, with
induction of aerobic glycolysis being a common observation. Our preliminary data suggest that the innate antiviral
immune response through IFN signaling induces aerobic glycolysis during RSV infection, while still maintaining
oxidative phosphorylation in the respiratory epithelium. Using an improved model to culture P. aeruginosa
biofilms in association with human CF airway epithelial cells and a RSV mouse infection model, we will examine
mechanisms by which antiviral interferon signaling promotes biofilm conversion by P. aeruginosa through a
mechanism of metabolic reprogramming. To this end, we will determine how metabolic reprogramming of the
respiratory epithelium facilitates viral-bacterial co-infection, define how secreted metabolic products from the
virus-infected respiratory epithelium promote P. aeruginosa persistence and chronic infection by impairing
antibacterial function in recruited macrophages and promoting bacterial biofilm growth. Our goal is to elucidate
the molecular mechanism for virus-stimulated bacterial biofilms and thus, identify new targets that could delay
acquisition and chronic bacterial colonization, or work in conjunction with existing therapies, to eradicate P.
aeruginosa in CF patients."

Core B (Pipkin)
Short hairpin RNAs in microRNA contexts (shRNAmirs) and CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA (sgRNA) are powerful
tools for experimental RNA interference (RNAi) and gene-disruption in the immune system, respectively.
However, virtually all current approaches require pre-activation of naive cells to render them susceptible for gene
transfer, typically with retroviral or lentiviral vectors, and cause constitutive RNAi or immediate gene-disruption.
These issues complicate studying genes that function prior to retroviral delivery, and clarifying the temporal
requirements of genes at different stages of immune responses. In Core B, we describe development of multiple
innovative tools and methods that substantially expands the utility of shRNAmirs and sgRNAs to study gene
function. We demonstrate generation of unmanipulated naive CD4 and CD8 T cells carrying conditionally
regulated retroviral constructs that enable conducting inducible and reversible RNAi in vivo, and extend this
system to a novel approach that facilitates large in vivo pooled screens using inducible shRNAmirs in untouched
naive cells. We also demonstrate CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA (sgRNA) gene disruption in primary B and T cells,
and its use during in vivo immune responses to analyze B and T cell function. The combination of these
shRNAmir and sgRNA approaches are synergistic and constitute an innovative and rigorous experimental
platform for rapidly dissecting gene function in T and B cells during in vivo immune responses. Core B builds on
multiple existing libraries of high-fidelity shRNAmir clones, which include those that target all genes encoding
mammalian chromatin regulator factors (312 genes, ~1,700 shRNAmirs), and all mammalian transcription factors
(2,083 genes, ~8,000 shRNAmirs). The overarching goal of Core B is to provide essential tools for executing the
proposed in vivo loss-of-function studies proposed in Projects 1-3 of this P01. Our specific objectives are to sub-
clone pooled shRNAmir libraries using an inducible vector for conditional pooled screens in naive T cells that
are proposed in Projects 2 and 3 (Aim 1); to produce high-quality, ready-to-transfect retroviral plasmid DNA
from cloned libraries of shRNAmirs and sgRNAs for Projects 1-3 (Aim 2); and to re-apply existing arrayed
shRNAmir libraries and build custom shRNAmir and gRNA clone sets in appropriate vectors based on gene
targets prioritized during the evolution of Projects 1-3 to facilitate detailed follow-up studies (Aim 3)."

Core C (Pipkin)
The overarching goal of Core C is to provide standardized, uniform and innovative next generation sequencing
(NGS) and computational approaches to address the genome-scale experiments proposed in Projects 1-3. The
individual Projects goals are to analyze pooled in vivo screens, gene expression, transcription and chromatin
structure and to discern the basic molecular regulation of T and B cell mediated immunity. Core C will facilitate
these objectives by using NGS approaches to analyze (1) pooled in vivo gene loss-of-function screens by
sequencing, (2) expression of chromatin-associated RNA (nascent RNA), and mature mRNA from limiting ex
vivo cell numbers, and single cells (scRNA-seq) using RNA-seq; (3) chromatin accessibility via the assay for
transposase-accessible chromatin followed by sequencing (ATAC-seq), and nucleosome organization (MNase-
seq and BEM-seq); and (4) CRF and TF binding to near base-pair resolution after chromatin immunoprecipitation
from small numbers of primary lymphocytes using ChIP-exo (Aims 1 and 2). Core C has demonstrated
experience in developing and applying all of these approaches. In addition, Core C has established a centralized,
interlinked and documented framework for the storage, analysis and sharing of these large datasets between
Projects 1-3 (Aim 3), and will apply available algorithms in creative arrangements that comprise computational
approaches to identify and define operational cis-regulatory regions based on chromatin accessibility,
nucleosome organization and histone modifications, and to infer utilized TF binding site motifs within these
regions and predict their cognate TFs. Furthermore, these observations will be correlated with transcriptional
activity (nascent RNA expression) and RNA Pol II activity (ChIP-seq) and TF and CRF binding events (ChIP-
exo), and overall gene expression (mRNA) in the context of gene-perturbations to clarify functionally how gene
regulatory networks drive T cell differentiation and function during immune responses in vivo."

Project 1 (Crotty)
Helper T cell differentiation and function are important processes for many diseases. Vaccines are one of the
most cost effective medical treatments in modern civilization. The vast majority of current human vaccines
function by eliciting protective antibody responses. T cell help to B cells is a fundamental aspect of adaptive
immunity to many pathogens. Follicular helper CD4 T cells (Tfh) are the specialized providers of help to B cells.
Therefore, there is substantial potential for an improved understanding of Tfh cells to facilitate better anti-
pathogen immune responses and vaccine-elicited humoral immunity. Work by our laboratory and others
established that TFH cells depend on expression of the transcription factor Bcl6 and other transcription factors.
Despite these advances, the pathways that control TFH differentiation and define TFH functions remain poorly
understood. In Project 1, we will characterize, stratify, and interconnect TFs, chromatin regulators, and helper
molecules that control TFH differentiation and function, leveraging our current tools and our team’s knowledge of
related pathways in CD8 T cells (Projects 2 & 3). Aim 1. To understand the mechanisms of action of Bcl6 in TFH
cell differentiation and function. Bcl6 is the lineage defining transcription factor of TFH cells. How Bcl6
accomplishes control of TFH differentiation and function remains unclear, because of the complexity of the
biology. Based on preliminary data, our operating model is that Bcl6 controls TFH differentiation by repressor-of-
repressor mechanisms. Putative mechanisms will be comprehensively tested. Aim 2. Aim 1 has identified and
will identify key Bcl6-r TFs. In Aim 2 we explore the biology of these TFs and the putative mechanisms by which
these TFs control TFH. Aim 3. TFH help to B cells is a multifaceted process for which much is still unknown
regarding the molecules involved. This is in part because it is a complex set of functions, and in part because of
previous technological limitations. It is likely that elucidating the immunobiology underlying the differentiation of
Tfh cells and the process of generating protective antiviral antibody responses will reveal vaccinology principles
that can be applied to future vaccine development against infectious scourges."
10885043,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Project 2 (Pipkin)
Activation of naive CD8 T cells during intracellular infections rapidly induces chromatin remodeling and
transcriptional reprogramming that results in the differentiation of memory (TMEM) CTLs that provide long-term
immunity. We discovered that the transcription factor (TF) Runx3 instigates chromatin accessibility of TMEM-
associated cis-regulatory regions in naive cells during initial T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, and is essential
for the differentiation of both circulating and tissue resident TMEM CTLs. Runx3 activates transcriptional circuits
that establishes nascent CTLs, represses alternative cell fates and prevents terminal CTL differentiation. Using
mass spectrometry we identified all subunits of the NuRD/HDAC complex in association with Runx3. In addition,
we conducted a pooled, RNA interference (RNAi) -mediated, loss-of-function screen in CD8 T cells responding
to viral infection that targeted all mammalian chromatin regulator factors (CRFs, 312 genes). This revealed that
deficiency in multiple individual NuRD/HDAC complex subunits impaired memory precursor CTL differentiation,
similar to Runx3 loss-of-function. In addition, multiple subunits of the BAF-family of nucleosome remodelers and
its collaborator Chd7, which is mutated in a human immunodeficiency, were essential for initiating very early
aspects of CTL differentiation and driving terminal differentiation. To gain insight into early aspects of CTL
development, we used a single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) approach and performed computational trajectory
analyses which identified common, and then branching developmental pathways from naive CD8s that lead
toward effector and memory cell fates. In part, we confirmed these pathways operationally using Blimp1-YFP
reporter alleles and adoptive transfer experiments. In the current application, we propose to build on these results
to elucidate how CRFs and TFs reprogram chromatin structure during naive cell activation and early
establishment of effector and memory-like developmental paths. Specifically, we will define how Runx3 and
NuRD/HDAC complexes remodel chromatin structure to establish initial TMEM transcriptional programs (Aim 1).
We will elucidate how hierarchical functions of Runx3, Ets1, Blimp1 and Bcl6 regulate the divergence of Blimp1hi
and Blimp1lo effector- and memory-like developmental paths, and use an in vivo conditional RNAi approach in
naive CD8s to screen all T cell-expressed TFs (1,751 genes) to identify their roles in this process during viral
infection (Aim 2). Finally, we will integrate these analyses with how BAF and Chd7 remodelers govern
nucleosome organization in cis-regulatory regions that control transcriptional reprograming during early CTL
differentiation (Aim 3). These studies integrate synergistically with analogous approaches addressing the roles
of CRFs and TFs in TFH differentiation and function (Crotty, Project 1), and how they function at later times to
maintain the differentiation and function of specific CD4 and CD8 TMEM cell subsets that persist following
infections, and that infiltrate tumors (Goldrath, Project 3).

10885044,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The general goals of this application for a new P30 ADRC at Columbia University include creating an
infrastructure for research on AD and related disorders, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations across many
departments, providing a rich training environment, and supporting outreach and patient recruitment. More
globally, the goals of our Center will extend to include participation in national coordinating efforts, working with
the national network of AD centers, and working with the National Institute on Aging and other organizations in
their advocacy efforts. Embedded within the general goals, the Center’s thematic goal will be on better
understanding the three biological pathways now considered to act as pathogenic drivers in AD: An ‘immune
response’ pathway, a ‘cholesterol metabolism’ pathway, and an ‘endosomal trafficking’ pathway. Both the
general and thematic goals were conceived with NAPA’s ambitious milestones in mind-- to prevent or treat AD
and related disorders, to optimize patient care, to extend patient support, and to enhance public awareness.
 The Administrative Core will act as the executive governing body of the Center that, with the guidance of its
various committees, will provide the vision and leadership necessary to achieve the Center’s general and
thematic goals. The Core will implement this vision by exercising managerial oversight over all aspects of the
Center, which includes assuring the highest standards of scientific and bioethical conduct, and a judicious use
of resources and funds.
 More specifically, the Core will achieve its goals by: Directing regular meeting with the Center’s Core leaders

10885956,"Project Summary
Despite longstanding efforts to improve recruitment of minorities into Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementias (ADRD) research, US Hispanics/Latinos continue to be severely underrepresented in ADRD
randomized clinical trials. Greater representation of Hispanics/Latinos is critical to ensure the safety and efficacy
of interventions and the generalizability of results across an increasingly diverse US population. Preclinical AD
trials will be essential in the pursuit of improved ADRD therapies and are unique in requiring asymptomatic
individuals to undergo biomarker testing and to enroll with a study partner. It is unclear, however, whether these
unique requirements pose a specific challenge to the recruitment of Hispanics/Latinos into preclinical AD trials.
It is imperative that we discover and test novel interventions to improve recruitment of Hispanics/Latinos to these
trials. Given my background as an epidemiologist with a solid foundation in health disparities research, I have
the dedication for undertaking this research. Through this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Career Development
Award, I propose to receive the necessary training and research experience to address several gaps and become
a leader in ADRD recruitment science. My overarching hypothesis is that older Hispanics/Latinos are less willing
than their Non-Hispanic (NHW) counterparts to participate in preclinical AD trials, due in part to modifiable
behavioral factors amenable to intervention. To test this hypothesis, I propose three specific research aims: (1)
First, I will examine differences in willingness to participate in preclinical AD trials between diverse
Hispanics/Latinos and Non-Hispanic whites (NHW) from a national population-based sample of 1,800 older
adults who respond to a web panel survey. (2) Next, through in-person cognitive interviews, I will identify key
behavioral determinants of intention to participation in a sample of 100 local community dwelling older
Hispanics/Latinos, with a particular focus on contextual factors, cultural beliefs/values, research literacy, previous
experiences with the healthcare system, research attitudes and perceived need/benefit. (3) Lastly, I will use an
Intervention Mapping planning approach to systematically develop and pilot test a behavioral intervention that is
culturally and linguistically appropriate and designed to improve Hispanic/Latino participation in AD preclinical
trials. Findings will provide preliminary data for a large multicenter trial to test the intervention using a randomized
approach. To accomplish these aims and my goal of becoming an independent investigator, I propose to engage
in extensive ADRD training through didactic instruction, experiential learning and mentorship by the leaders in
the field. I will leverage resources from the University of California, Irvine Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center
to (a) acquire foundational knowledge of core principles in ADRD research, (b) gain experience in mixed-
methods approaches in recruitment science, (c) become proficient in designing behavioral interventions, and (d)
develop the leadership skills necessary to conduct multicenter studies and propel my research forward."
10885980,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Maternal mental illness following childbirth is associated with substantial societal costs.
Postpartum psychopathology is a leading contributor of maternal morbidity and mortality and can endanger the
child’s wellbeing onward from birth. Deprivation of maternal care during the early neonatal period can induce
long-term epigenetic alterations in a model animal, suggesting that postpartum mental illness can confer
intergenerational risks. While efforts exist to reduce postpartum depression, childbirth-related posttraumatic
stress disorder (CB-PTSD), a condition that is estimated to affect 240,000 American women each year, is
underdiagnosed and undertreated. Risk factors for CB-PTSD remain elusive, and knowledge about the
disorder’s course and impact on the child is almost entirely lacking. By generating important and substantive
data, the central objective of this proposal is to serve as a first step towards addressing the clinical gap for a
condition that should be amenable to early intervention.
In this first of its kind longitudinal prospective study, we will study pregnant women during third trimester (Wk.
32), again in the hours following delivery and will follow them at repeated time points across the postpartum (PP)
year, i.e., Day 1, Day 45, and Mos. 3, 6, and 12. Their infants will be studied at Mo. 6 and Mo. 12 PP. This
schedule will allow us to examine risk for, and development of, CB-PTSD, as well as its influence on mother-
infant bonding and early child development. Maternal CB-PTSD will be quantified using psychodiagnostic,
psychometric, and psychophysiologic measures. Psychophysiological responsivity during mental imagery of the
traumatic childbirth provides a potentially reliable biological marker of PTSD and can provide objective validation
of the CB-PTSD diagnosis. Bonding will be quantified using psychometric assessments of maternal perceptions
and an observational assessment of mother-child interaction at 6 mos. PP. Child outcomes will be quantified
using a standardized child developmental observational procedure and standardized psychometrics at 12 mos.
This study will offer new insights into the previously understudied posttraumatic dimension of postpartum
psychopathology. Our work could suggest modifications of postpartum mental health care, which currently
focuses on depression. Our findings may inform tools that can be used for early screening that may be the first
step in implementing programs that can enhance the welfare of mother and child, thereby reducing the odds of
developing a potentially preventable, costly posttraumatic disorder. In addition, the proposed study will further
the NICHD missions that “women avoid harmful effects from reproductive processes and children achieve
healthy and productive lives”."
11135764,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Maternal mental illness following childbirth is associated with substantial societal costs.
Postpartum psychopathology is a leading contributor of maternal morbidity and mortality and can endanger the
child’s wellbeing onward from birth. Deprivation of maternal care during the early neonatal period can induce
long-term epigenetic alterations in a model animal, suggesting that postpartum mental illness can confer
intergenerational risks. While efforts exist to reduce postpartum depression, childbirth-related posttraumatic
stress disorder (CB-PTSD), a condition that is estimated to affect 240,000 American women each year, is
underdiagnosed and undertreated. Risk factors for CB-PTSD remain elusive, and knowledge about the
disorder’s course and impact on the child is almost entirely lacking. By generating important and substantive
data, the central objective of this proposal is to serve as a first step towards addressing the clinical gap for a
condition that should be amenable to early intervention.
In this first of its kind longitudinal prospective study, we will study pregnant women during third trimester (Wk.

10883925,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD-Related Disorders (AD/ADRD) are significantly increasing in
resource-limited areas, where improved nutrition and decreased infectious disease mortality are
enabling population aging. Simultaneously, enduring elevated levels of early-life adversity and
adult hardship accelerates the development of aging-related diseases like AD/ADRD.
Interventions are needed to reduce disease burden and increase healthy lifespan. Cash transfer
programs are proven to reduce mortality in these settings. However, their impact on risk for
chronic diseases of aging remains unclear. We propose a novel method to address this
knowledge gap: epigenetic clock analysis of the pace and progress of biological aging.
Epigenetic clocks can reveal otherwise occult health risks in young adults and forecast long-
term disease outcomes, including AD/ADRD. Our study will assay dried bloodspot
biospecimens from 4,000 participants in a randomized controlled trial of an unconditional cash
transfer program, and test if transfers can slow biological aging. We will also investigate the role
of immune aging, a crucial AD/ADRD risk driver, and quantify associations of epigenetic clock
and immune aging measures with early AD/ADRD risk factors. Our study will be among the first
to characterize epigenetic-clock and immune aging phenotypes in a low-resource-setting cohort,
to test cash-transfer effects on biological aging, and to examine how biological and immune
aging relate to cognitive functioning and AD/ADRD risk factors in a low resource setting. This
innovative study will conduct a rigorous test of a cash transfer program's impact on biological
aging, cognition, and AD/ADRD risk, providing insights for developing strategies to extend
healthy life years and reduce AD/ADRD risk."

The long-term goal of this research program is to identify negative consequences associated with e-cigarettes
and other newer tobacco products, and reduce the health burden of tobacco use by developing interventions
and identifying policies to reduce youth use. This proposal focuses on e-cigarette use, which has increased
substantially and is now the most common nicotine product used by US youth. Our collective knowledge is not
yet sufficient to identify factors that can be targeted in e-cigarette interventions, or to be sure that we
understand the negative consequences of use. We propose to take advantage of the unique nature of the
ABCD study, which includes regular assessments of a large, nationally representative cohort from ages 9 to
19. The design of the study will allow us to examine a range of both (1) modifiable risk factors for e-cigarette
use and (2) behavioral, psychological, neurocognitive, and physiological consequences of use.
The goals of this study are to prospectively test the following hypotheses: (1) e-cigarette initiation and
progression in children is driven by modifiable social, contextual, and individual risk factors; (2) children who try
e-cigarettes will be more likely to become users of combustible tobacco products; (3) youth e-cigarette use is
associated with neural alterations and neurocognitive deficits; (4) e-cigarette use in adolescence is associated
with negative health consequences.
Our goals are twofold. First, we seek to identify modifiable factors among children that are associated with risk
of chronic tobacco use and dependence, in order to inform intervention development. Second, we aim to
delineate the extent to which e-cigarette use causes negative physical, behavioral and cognitive
consequences, in order to inform policymakers who have regulatory authority over tobacco products. The
overarching goal is to reduce tobacco use among youth and thus associated morbidity and mortality."
10885600,"Abstract
Aerobic exercise might affect the brain through a plurality of pathways, including via modulation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis regulates the release of cortisol, a glucocorticoid
hormone that is related to impaired cognitive performance, reduced brain volume and function, and increased
risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), including markers of AD pathophysiology. Many of the same brain regions
and cognitive domains affected by high cortisol levels are the same that are positively affected by engaging in
regular aerobic exercise. Thus, we hypothesize that aerobic exercise-induced changes in cortisol might act as
a pathway by which long-term exercise influences neurocognitive health. Further, we speculate that aerobic
exercise might influence AD neuropathology through its influence on cortisol. Addressing these gaps could
have far-reaching application for adopting exercise as a method of preventing or treating cognitive impairment.
We address these unanswered questions in this high-risk/high-reward R21 application. The proposed study will
conduct an analysis of hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in a large and uniquely well-characterized sample
of cognitively normal older adults (N=648). Hair samples have been collected and banked both before and
after a multi-site Phase III dose-response 12-month supervised randomized clinical trial of exercise titled
Investigating Gains in Neurocognition in an Intervention Trial of Exercise (IGNITE). The IGNITE study and the
banked hair samples in N=648 will serve as the basis for the proposed study. This proposal reflects an
unprecedented opportunity to determine whether aerobic exercise-induced changes to HCC statistically
mediates changes to cognition, AD neuropathology, brain volume or function, and is in line with the NIH
mission to leverage existing cohort and RCT samples for cost-effectively testing new hypotheses. Our primary
aims include: Aim 1. Examine whether exercise-induced changes in HCC statistically mediates cognitive
changes resulting from the intervention. Aim 2. Examine whether exercise-induced changes in HCC
statistically mediates exercise-related changes in hippocampal and prefrontal function and volume. Aim 3:
Examine whether changes in HCC mediates exercise associations with AD neuropathology. Aim 4: The
results from the HCC assays obtained from funding this application will be incorporated into the larger IGNITE
database and will be made available to investigators interested in exploring HCC with the rich phenotyping of
IGNITE participants."
10881397,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this proposal is to improve upon current methods to identify genetic contributors to rare diseases,
especially neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in children. Finding such variants is both of fundamental
biological value and has potential clinical relevance to the affected individuals and their families. To improve
upon current approaches, a DNA sequencing platform from Pacific Biosciences, called “HiFi”, will be used.
Preliminary data suggest that HiFi can reveal disease-relevant genetic variants that were missed by standard
genome sequencing approaches. Genomes of 500 affected individuals will be sequenced using HiFi, and for
200 of them, their parents will also be sequenced (900 total genomes sequenced). This process will be optimized
to balance data quality, accuracy, and costs. Comprehensive maps of genetic variation and de novo genome
assemblies will be generated for each individual using a variety of methods, which will be systematically
benchmarked and improved. These results will be analyzed to identify variants in the proband that may be
causally related to their symptoms using commonly accepted standards for clinical interpretation of genomic
data. Variants found to be relevant for a particular proband’s symptoms will be validated with orthogonal testing
and returned to families by a genetic counselor, if such return is deemed appropriate by the referring clinician.
This study will address a major challenge in human genetics, and potentially lead to a fundamental change in
the way human genome sequencing is performed in both research and clinical settings."
10873965,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The systemic inflammatory response syndrome, driven by a host’s response to inflammatory triggers such as
foreign pathogens and cytokines, causes significant dysfunction in the vasculature. This dysfunction is due to
the loss of homeostatic mechanisms within the endothelium and manifests as intravascular fluid loss, abnormal
leukocyte trafficking, disrupted coagulation and altered vascular tone. Despite its overwhelming and obvious
negative effect on patients and their outcomes, targeting vascular pathways, such the vasodilator nitric oxide,
has not yielded successful results. The failure of such trials, along with the general absence of effective
treatments for acute systemic inflammation, has left clinicians with no therapeutic options beyond supportive
care. Unfortunately, the root cause of vascular dysfunction in acute systemic inflammation remains completely
unknown and with many unanswered questions. What spatiotemporal protein interactions or metabolic pathways
contribute to or counterbalance the dysfunction? Does the presence of vasculopathy lead to specific genomic or
proteomic signatures, known as endotypes, and how can they be modeled? What unique endothelial targets
exist that can be utilized to improve vascular function and restore homeostasis? To answer these questions and
any further that will arise, our research program will focus on three integrated themes. Theme one will explore
molecular mechanisms that dysregulate endothelial homeostasis during acute inflammation. Mechanisms such
as direct protein-protein interactions, mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species signaling will be
explored using a variety of techniques including genetic modification, glycolytic and oxidative stress capacity and
proximity ligation assays. Theme two will focus on modeling endothelial dysfunction utilizing overlapping
procedures in both animals and humans to identify consistent patterns. This theme will test animal models of
systemic inflammation in combination with acutely ill human patients using non-invasive vascular reactivity
techniques, such as laser doppler perfusion monitoring, coupled with genomic and proteomic signatures. In
addition, the use of microfluidic devices (i.e. tissue-on-a-chip) will create a bridge between the more adaptable
animal models and the non-adaptable human patient populations to test if a synthetic human system will correlate
with data derived from mechanism driven animal studies. The third theme will focus on drug discovery. This
theme will use the biochemical mechanisms found in the prior themes to help discover endothelial-specific,
targeted treatments. Use of cell-penetrating peptides coupled to novel compounds or peptide sequences will
allow cell permeation to the target of interest. In addition, testing of therapies used in chronic vascular dysfunction
will be examined to determine if similar mechanisms can be tempered in acute systemic vasculopathy. These
integrated themes support the overarching goal of this research program, which is to better understand
mechanisms that affect acute endothelial-mediated vascular dysfunction with the overall intent of being able to
identify and treat patients with acute vasculopathy during systemic inflammation to improve clinical outcomes."

 Research and training on motor control at UChicago have a unique history of combining neurobiology and
neuromechanics research with computational approaches. In the past few years, the University has
significantly expanded its neuroscience community with the establishment of the new Neuroscience Institute.
The significant investments have created exciting new opportunities for research and training in the area of
motor control and movement and related disorders, especially in addressing questions by integrating
experimental and computational approaches.
 Our training program will take advantage of the existing breadth and depth of motor control and movement
research on campus. We have 15 Trainers whose research is focused on motor control and movement,
covering a broad range from genetic, molecular and cellular studies to circuit, systems, biomechanics and
computational approaches. Our research interests have a broad anatomic scope, from neuromuscular junction
and spinal cord to cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. We employ a broad range of model
organisms including invertebrates, insects, zebrafish and mice to non-human primates and human subjects.
 In evaluating candidates for the Training Program, a criterion will be their demonstrated interest in bridging
experimental and computational work as an element of their dissertations. Trainees will complete the following
Program Elements. 1. The “Experimental Design in Motor Control Research” course. 2. One or two rotations
that broaden exposure to approaches. 3. Annual problem-solving workshop. 4. Journal club that emphasizes
statistical methods. With the activities, we will bring together faculty and students whose work is mainly
experimental and those whose work is computational. We will explore as a community how fundamental
questions in motor control can be addressed at a range of levels of approach. In addition to the trainees
supported by the T32, we will add Associate Members so that any trainee who is working on motor control
research or is interested in motor control research could participate in T32 sponsored activities. All trainees will
gain key skills in statistics methods. Writing and presentation skills will be emphasized throughout the training.
 Faculty in our Training Program have primary appointments in five departments (Neurology, Neurobiology,
Organismal Biology and Anatomy, Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, Anesthesia and Critical Care), and
appointments in one or more than one of the five participating Graduate Programs (Neurobiology;
Computational Neuroscience; Genetics, Genomics and Systems Biology; Integrative Biology; Medical Scientist
Training Program).
 We propose to support 6 predoctoral trainees (starting with 3 slots in year 1). Students will be supported for
2 years during years 3 and 4 of their graduate training. We will appoint 3 new trainees every year."

The goal of this Northwell Roybal Center for Personalized Trials: Physical Activity Promotion for
Persons Giving Care or Living with AD/ADRD is to generate behavioral intervention development research
for enhancing physical activity (Roybal Theme: Spur the Initiation and Maintenance of Physical Activity
Regimens that are Personalized to Caregivers or Persons with AD/ADRD). The Northwell Roybal Center is
comprised of two components: the Administrative Core and the Behavioral Intervention Development Core.
Our Administrative Core will develop and provide the strategic vision, leadership, and the full range of NIH
Stage Model expertise needed for the success of this Roybal Center; monitor Center clinical trials progress
and provide immediate feedback; develop, identify, and use common metrics for Center productivity evaluation
purposes. Finally, the core will facilitate collaboration with other Roybal Centers, the Coordinating Center, the
National Institute on Aging, and scientists across the nation interested in advancing the initiation and
maintenance of physical activity regimens personalized to care providers or those living with AD/ADRD.
Our Behavioral Intervention Development (BID) Core will proactively determine a national pool of potential
eligible scientists for later national competitions, review and select meritorious clinical trials for funding, and
ensure compliance of all clinical trials with all regulatory agencies. The BID will then support investigators
identified via this national competition to implement identified innovative clinical trials that align with the themes
of the Northwell Roybal Center in Years 3 through 5 of the proposed project. The BID Core will also support
the conduct of two Stage II fully-powered clinical trials in Years 1 and 2 that aim to foster habitual physical
among caregivers for persons with AD/ADRD. Trial #1 will work to develop habitual daily walking among
caregivers. In contrast, Trial #2 will develop habitual hourly walking to reduce the amount of time caregivers
spend sedentary. Both trials will measure the key mechanism of behavior (MoBC) of cognitive automaticity.
The overall mission of the Northwell Roybal Center for Personalized Trials is to establish an infrastructure
organized per the NIH Stage Model with scientiﬁc expertise and resources to conduct Stages 0-V trials of the
translational behavioral intervention development pipeline, as well as examining key MoBCs of behavior
change, and so serve as a national resource for the behavioral and social intervention research community in
initiating and maintaining personalized physical activity regimen for caregivers or persons living with
AD/ADRD."

Abstract
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) results in over 400,000 hospitalizations each year in the US, with a portion of these
patients developing hepatorenal syndrome with acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI). There are no current therapeutic
options that specifically address the cellular dysfunction and systemic inflammatory response that leads to
progressive organ failure mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress by direct alcohol-mediated
toxicity. This leads to impaired hepatocyte and renal function, worsening organ failure, and the need for protective
renal and hepatic therapies with the goal of improving clinical outcomes for patients who develop HRS-AKI.
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a hallmark of aging-related disease for the liver and kidney.
Decreased levels and impaired synthesis of NAD+ are found in ALD accompanied by increased de novo
lipogenesis and impaired mitochondrial oxidation made possible by the role of alcohol in NAD+ depletion and
impaired cellular function. NAD+ supplementation with the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) reverses
alcohol-induced changes by increasing NAD+ levels in tissue culture, enhancing mitochondrial oxidation,
mitochondrial biogenesis, and gene expression. In animal models, NAD+ supplementation with NR has been
shown to improve liver histology, reduce liver injury and protect the kidneys against ischemic injury and DNA
damage preventing progressive worsening of renal injury. 2,4 dihydronicotinamide riboside (NRH), , a recently
identified highly potent NAD+ precursor, consistently increases intracellular NAD+ levels to a greater extent than
NR in liver and kidney, is stable in serum, and in addition acts as a highly potent immune modulator to dampen
the systemic inflammatory state. Given the significant depletion in NAD+ levels in both liver and kidney in patients
with ALD, NRH has the potential to reverse or prevent progression of HRS-AKI in ALD patients in combination
with the standard of care. In this Fast Track study, we will complete IND-enabling studies of our proprietary
intravenous formulation of NRH, MP04, followed by a Phase 1 clinical trial to investigate its safety and tolerability
in humans. The outcome of this work will be a novel therapeutic for ALD-associated HRS."
10873806,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a respiratory disease that causes the death of 1.5 million people each year. Approximately
30% of the human population worldwide are latently infected with TB, creating a risk for developing active TB
and transmission. Genomic studies have attempted to identify innate immune genes and polymorphisms that
affect susceptibility to TB among humans. Despite findings that suggest correlation of certain genetic
polymorphisms in specific immune genes with TB susceptibility, genomic studies have failed to identify specific
isoforms that might influence human TB susceptibility. This is because innate immune genes are highly
conserved among humans, making them exhibit similar immune responses to TB bacteria. By contrast, different
species of nonhuman primates exhibit different levels of susceptibility to TB. Rhesus macaques (macaca
mulatta) are more susceptible to TB compared to cynomolgus macaques (macaca fascicularis), yet the
underlying mechanism of this variation is unknown. It is crucial to compare innate immune response genes
across primate species in response to TB infection to identify the differences in immune orthologs that help
eliminate TB bacteria. Using comparative genomics approaches, this study explores and characterizes immune
responses across species by ex-vivo infection of different primate blood cells with TB bacteria using long-read
RNA-Seq. The use of long-read RNA-Seq provides a more comprehensive annotation of innate immune
orthologs across primate species which wasn’t possible in past studies using short-read RNA-seq. This study will
help identify species-specific immune orthologs important in immunity against TB, which might ultimately be
used to evaluate drug targets for human TB prevention and treatment. This comparative genomic approach can
also be applied to identify species-specific immune orthologs as drug targets for other infectious diseases."

Dr. Christopoulos is an infectious disease physician and Associate Professor of Medicine in the Division of
HIV, ID, and Global Medicine at UCSF. Her research over the past ten years has focused on improving
engagement in HIV care for underserved urban populations by identifying those at risk for poor engagement,
understanding barriers to and facilitators of engagement, and developing interventions to support engagement.
She has mentored numerous early career investigators, including pre-doctoral students, post-doctoral fellows,
and junior faculty but now seeks the protected time of the K24 award to increase the depth and scope of her
mentorship, undertake dedicated mentorship skills training, and grow her program of patient oriented research.
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted further the need for rigorous evaluation of the impact of innovations
in HIV care delivery to ensure their use does not widen HIV health disparities. In this application, Dr.
Christopoulos proposes a comprehensive mentoring, research, and career development plan to promote the
equitable delivery of HIV care and treatment in a post-COVID landscape. Leveraging the infrastructure of the
CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) and her role as UCSF site PI, the research proposed in
this application seeks to investigate the impact of advances in HIV care and treatment, i.e., telehealth, long-
acting injectable antiretroviral therapy, on retention and viral suppression. In addition to the resources of
CNICS, which include a mentoring core, Dr. Christopoulos will utilize an implementation science R01 on long-
acting injectable antiretroviral therapy, training and career resources at UCSF, and a robust network of
multidisciplinary collaborators to provide mentees with training opportunities, preliminary data, and platforms
on which to build new research. Through the guidance of an experienced senior mentoring team, formal
didactics, and mentee feedback, she will augment and formalize her mentoring abilities and approach with
additional training in mentoring across differences and supporting under-represented minority (URM)
investigators, building an equity focus in her mentoring as well as her research. The K24 is instrumental to
achieving her long-term career goals of becoming an international leader on the topic of engagement in HIV
care and maximizing the impact of her scientific pursuits by training the next generation of researchers focused
on optimizing HIV care engagement."
10880445,"Oral diseases and disorders in the craniofacial complex disproportionally and devastatingly afflict susceptible
populations, particularly impoverished families and medically or physically compromised persons. Novel
engineering approaches, properly leveraged, can yield new paradigms to reveal disease mechanism, new
strategies for disease mitigation, and new approaches for affordable/personalized therapies for dental caries,
periodontal diseases, and oral cancer. To achieve this vision, academic research bound dentist-scientists must
be adept in engineering concepts and engineers must be educated in oral and craniofacial sciences and
needs; all must be aware of the complex clinical and regulatory landscapes. To address this urgent need, we
propose a multidisciplinary training program in Penn’s School of Dental Medicine (PDM) and School of
Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS) focused on training dentist-scientists and engineers for
academic careers dedicated to research in precision oral health and healthcare innovation. Postdoctoral
trainees will adopt cutting-edge approaches at the forefront of engineering and computational sciences to
advance the fields of oral biofilm microbiome, host immunity and tissue regeneration, drawing on approaches
including artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, and materials sciences, aware of developmental
hurdles and requirements to safely bring new approaches to patients. Trainees will engage in interactive and
tailored academic experiences with intensive mentored research via co-mentoring (one advisor from each
school), and interaction with a career mentoring committee (CMC) that includes at least one dental clinician.
Co-mentors and CMC members will be drawn from the Program Faculty of 26 faculty in PDM and SEAS with
significant records of mentorship of multidisciplinary and translational research. Training will include: (1)
engineering fundamentals for dental trainees and oral & craniofacial biology principles for engineering trainees,
tailored to match their research project and academic needs, (2) clinical research and regulatory affairs, (3)
principles of scientific rigor and reproducibility, (4) scientific writing and (5) workshops on professional and
career development. Trainees will engage in academic and industry interactions, journal club, give symposia
presentations, and participate in AADR/IADR activities. Training will culminate in F/K award applications
focused on advancing oral health at the dental-engineering interface. The applicant pool at the University of
Pennsylvania is exceptionally strong and diverse, and we anticipate being able to attract outstanding
candidates. Furthermore, via partnerships with ADA, AADR/IADR and minority-serving dental schools, we will
diversify our candidate pool. We plan to enroll 4 trainees per year. Importantly, this effort will be an element of
a newly formed inter-school center between PDM and SEAS with shared funding. The proposed program,
unique to Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment within a compact campus where
resources for both schools are united through Penn’s new Center for Innovation and Precision Dentistry."
10879138,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a deadly cancer that is preceded by a metaplastic change called Barrett's
esophagus (BE). It has long been thought that endoscopic screening for BE followed by endoscopic surveillance
can significantly decrease the mortality of EAC. This unfortunately has not borne out as the cost and
inconvenience of conscious sedation prohibits endoscopy from being used as a population-based screening tool.
BE screening may become possible in the future, owing to innovative swallowable tethered capsule
endomicroscopes or cell sampling devices that can detect BE without requiring sedation. Yet, even if these
capsules were to identify the large number of people in the US who have BE (~15M), endoscopic surveillance
of this group would be prohibitively expensive. If we could use tissue biomarkers to identify the 5% of those with
BE who will develop EAC in their lifetimes, then endoscopic intervention could be given to those who really need
it, and those with low-risk BE would not require further follow up.
Recognition of this need has motivated the field to identify BE progression biomarkers derived from esophageal
tissue samples obtained by autofluorescence/reflectance-targeted endoscopy. This research has identified
biomarkers such as aneuploidy and aberrant p53/cyclin A expression as strong predictors of BE progression.
Unfortunately, the only way to target and obtain these tissues today is through sedated endoscopy. With the
modifications proposed here, a new BE screening technology that we have developed called optical coherence
tomography (OCT) tethered capsule endomicroscopy (TCE), could enable targeted biopsy without sedation.
OCT-TCE obtains 3D microscopic images of the entire esophagus in unsedated subjects, accurately identifies
BE, and has been successfully used by nurses and technicians in primary care settings. Here, we propose to
advance OCT-TCE for targeted biopsy by adding autofluorescence and reflectance spectral imaging technology
that can help identify tissue enriched in molecular alterations associated with BE progression risk. The new
capsule will also have a cryobiopsy mechanism for acquiring targeted tissue samples under real time image
guidance. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will develop this multimodality TCE with biopsy (MM-TCEB) device and
show that it works as intended in a study of 20 BE patients. Then, we will conduct a clinical study in 100
unsedated BE patients to demonstrate that MM-TCEB collects tissue and identifies BE progression biomarkers
as well as sedated endoscopy. In Aim 3, we will develop image analysis and deep learning algorithms to mine
the Aim 2 data, uncovering new relationships between OCT, autofluorescence, and reflectance spectroscopy
and tissue-derived BE progression biomarkers. By acquiring targeted biopsies using a swallowable tethered
capsule in unsedated subjects, MM-TCEB can become a powerful technique for obtaining esophageal tissue
samples for BE progression biomarker discovery, validation, and ultimately population-based screening."
10881536,"The identification of the association of the TREM2 p.R47H varienat with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk
highlighted the impact of the immune response and inflammation in (AD). However, the role of TREM2 in
health and in AD as well as what other genes are part of the TREM2 pathway are not totally known. We have
demonstrated that soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) levels may reflect biological events that link amyloid deposition
and neurofibrillary tangle formation to cognitive decline, and that can be used to genetic studies. Using CSF
sTREM2 levels as endophenotype we demonstrated that MS4A4A is the major regular of sTREM2 and a
potential target. In a more recent study in almost 3,000 CSF samples, we identified four loci, including
MS4A4A, TREM2, TGFBR2 and NECTIN2. In this proposal, we will perform the first multi-tissue genetic
screening of sTREM2 regulators. We will analyze very large datasets in brain (n=5,164), CSF (n=6,800) and
plasma (n=56,900) from well-characterized cohorts with extensive pre-existing CSF biomarker (Aβ, Tau, ptau
and sTREM2), clinical and genetic data. The aims of the project are: 1) to identify single (common and rare)
variants, genes and pathways associated with sTREM2 levels; 2) to identify multi-tissue multi-omic signatures
of TREM2 risk variants and 3) to perform functional analyses in iPSC-derived human microglia to determine
the mechanisms by which TGFBR2 and NECTIN2 affect sTREM2 levels and microglia function."
10882890,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) affects 1 in 250 people and is characterized by impaired low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) metabolism resulting in premature cardiovascular disease. CRISPR-Cas9-induced loss of
function mutations in the gene encoding Angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) has been proposed as a therapeutic
strategy to permanently reduce LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels and lower cardiovascular disease risks.
However, the absence of safe and effective methods for delivering CRISPR components into hepatocytes is a
major barrier. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are the platform of choice for delivering gene-editing reagents
but are associated with severe limitations. In addition, Cas9 immunity is highly prevalent in the human
population further complicating AAV delivery. We propose to introduce gene-editing reagents into hepatocytes
using nonviral delivery approaches ex vivo, then transplanting the engineered hepatocytes to replace diseased
hepatocytes to treat FH. Our nonviral ex vivo strategy avoids two complications of in vivo approaches since
CRISPR-Cas9 editing is only restricted to the intended target cells and enables the opportunity to maintain
cells in culture until they are no longer immunogenic. But this ex vivo approach has one potential drawback:
How to enhance the number of edited hepatocytes engrafted in the liver. To address this challenge, we will use
a novel approach for selecting edited hepatocytes using fever medicine acetaminophen (APAP). We
hypothesize that gene edited hepatocytes lacking NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (Cypor) will be
enriched in vivo by APAP administration without permanent liver damage. In the proposed studies, we will
directly compare LNPs, electroporation and AAVs for gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt Cypor and
Angptl3. We will then replace diseased hepatocytes with gene edited hepatocytes in an established mouse
model of FH (Ldlr–/– ) using APAP selection. In Aim 1, we will compare specificity and efficiency of multiplex
gene editing in Cypor and Angptl3 by electroporation, LNP, and AAV-mediated delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 in
primary mouse hepatocytes. For Aim 2, we will optimize transplantation and APAP-mediated selection of gene-
edited hepatocytes and evaluate the long-term effects of Cypor-knockdown in Ldlr-/- mice while comparing
LNP, electroporation, and AAV-mediated ex vivo delivery of Cypor-CRISPR-Cas9. In Aim 3, we will compare
the effects of nonviral and AAV-mediated multiplex delivery of Cypor and Angptl3-CRISPR-Cas9 on the
capacity of hepatocytes to lower plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels and circumvent Cas9 immunity in
Ldlr–/– mice subjected to transient APAP treatment. This project is the first to directly compare different nonviral
approaches to AAVs for engineering hepatocytes ex vivo and evaluate the extent that edited hepatocytes
clonally expand in vivo using APAP to treat FH. In addition, this study is the first to study the immunogenicity of
ex vivo gene edited hepatocytes."
10882893,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Insulin resistance in the vasculature is often linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). This occurs prior to
metabolic derangement as evidenced by endothelial dysfunction that, in turn, contributes to the rises in blood
pressure and glucose. However, the mechanism by which vascular dysfunction occurs throughout the
progression from obesity to T2D is unknown. A better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for
differences in vascular function between people with obesity and T2D compared to lean healthy controls can
provide critical mechanistic understandings into disease progression as well as potentially identify novel
therapeutic targets. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are produced by cells in the body that carry bioactive substances
in the blood to modulate signaling is distant tissues. Based on our preliminary work, not only does insulin promote
greater clearance of EVs, but the reduction relates to metabolic insulin sensitivity, arterial compliance and fuel
utilization. Consistent with this, we have seen that EVs from healthy controls promote vasodilation under insulin
stimulation in contrast to people with obesity that blunt this action via potential miRNA differences. Herein, we
propose overall that insulin acts on extracellular vesicles (EVs) to influence vascular insulin sensitivity. We
hypothesize that insulin will 1) promote EV uptake; 2) activate EV cargo (e.g., insulin signaling/miRNA/eNOS) to
3) foster vasoreactivity of blood vessels in response to insulin. In this longitudinal prospective trial, 40-70y T2D
patients will be matched-paired to adults with lean to obese BMIs with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Then
people with obesity and T2D will exercise for 16 weeks as a means of testing improved insulin sensitivity with
changes in plasma EVs physiology. First, we will examine how EVs mediate Insulin induced vascular effects
utilizing in-vitro and ex/in-vivo models (AIM 1). Then, we will identify EV cargo as effector of insulin mediated
signaling by performing highly sensitive targeted and unbiased EV RNA and protein cargo analysis (AIM 2).
Lastly, we will ascertain that exercise modulates EV mediated insulin sensitivity (AIM 3). These collective EV
measures will be related to insulin-stimulated arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity and augmentation index),
and nitric oxide-mediated arterial function in conduit (flow mediated dilation), resistance (post-ischemic flow
velocity) and microvascular (contrast enhanced ultrasound) vessels to translate mechanism to function in
humans. If these hypotheses are correct, they will indicate 1) insulin acts on EVs as a novel mechanism of
vascular function, 2) provide the first indication of whether EVs release cargo to impact endothelial function and
3) showcase a novel mechanism by which exercise contributes to CVD risk reduction. Thus, identification of EV,
insulin action and exercise interactions will lay foundation for improving precision medicine that corrects vascular
dysfunction in efforts to attenuate/prevent T2D and CV morbidity as well as mortality."
10880936,"Dysregulated inflammation contributes to retinal degeneration. Although inflammatory cells may initially
limit retinal damage by phagocytosing dying mutant photoreceptors and secreting reparative molecules,
excessive inflammation causes recruitment of additional reactive microglia, phagocytosis of viable
photoreceptors and toxic cytokine release, which accelerates retinal degeneration irrespective of the
primary mutation. Therefore, a central challenge for developing anti-inflammatory therapies for retinal
degenerations is to selectively suppress detrimental inflammation while maintaining beneficial
inflammatory responses. We recently demonstrated that the cytokine IL-27 regulates beneficial and
detrimental inflammatory signals in the retina and protects photoreceptors. IL-27 is a pleiotropic
cytokine that regulates tissue reactions to infection, neuronal disease and tumors. We found that higher
endogenous IL-27 levels were associated with photoreceptor protection induced by an innate immunity
inhibitor in the rd10 mouse model of inherited retinal degeneration. In studies directly testing IL-27
function, we demonstrated that intravitreal injections of IL-27 into rd10 led to reduced pro-inflammatory
cytokines, increased rod and cone photoreceptor survival and prolonged improvement in visual acuity.
Additionally, IL-27 increased markers of protective microglia and reduced neurotoxic microglia.
Because most research to date has focused on pro-inflammatory signals in the retina, a major
unanswered question is how anti-inflammatory regulators such as IL-27 reduce neurotoxic inflammation
during retinal degeneration. This proposed study will build upon our exciting data by defining
mechanisms by which IL-27 signaling regulates inflammation and promotes photoreceptor survival (Aim
1). Additionally, IL-27 is expressed in Muller glia and IL-27 receptors are in microglia but whether these
cells coordinate to regulate inflammation through IL-27 is not known. We will use conditional knockout
mice and gene overexpression to identify whether a novel Muller glia and microglia cytokine-cytokine
receptor signaling axis mediates IL-27-induced photoreceptor protection (Aim 2). The research team
combines the expertise of the PI, Abigail Hackam – retinal degeneration and neuroinflammation, and
collaborator Stefan Kurtenbach – scRNA seq and transcriptomics. The findings from this study will be
significant to identifying a novel regulatory signal that controls inflammation, which will be relevant for
precisely controlling inflammation and restoring tissue homeostasis during retinal degeneration. We will
also generate novel insights into the roles of Muller glia-microglia interactions in controlling retinal
inflammation. Finally, by characterizing a potential new therapeutic approach that is not dependent on
the primary mutation, this study will set the foundation for developing IL-27 as a therapeutic strategy for
protecting photoreceptors and rescuing vision during retinal disease."
10882087,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiac amyloidosis can be caused by a mutation in transthyretin (TTR) (e.g. valine 122 to isoleucine, VI) [ATTR-
CM] that will aggregate when taken up by the myocardium, resulting in cytotoxicity and ultimately dysfunction.
The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of ATTR-CM remain unknown. Further, methods to enhance the
degradation of dissociated and deposited transthyretin is a critical unmet need. We reported protein kinase G
(PKG) can enhance protein degradation via the proteasome and lysosome to attenuate cardiac disease. We
recently uncovered that PKG also phosphorylates a ubiquitin ligase/co-chaperone, Chip (carboxyl terminus of
Hsc70-interacting protein), at serine 19 (human; S20, mouse). Chip is a primary mediator of cardiomyocyte
proteostasis by ubiquitinating and shuttling proteins for degradation. With new and exciting pilot data we show
PKG activity and Chip S19 phosphorylation (pS19) are uniquely depressed in ATTR-CM patients. We also reveal
cardiomyocytes isolated from ATTR-CM patients have reduced myofibrillar function. The field has been stymied
by lack of models, especially in vivo, and access to human tissue. We addressed these limitations by creating
novel models and a biorepository of biopsies from ATTR-CM patients. In vitro, we developed engineered heart
tissue (EHT) and cardiac organoids formed from human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. To create
ATTR-CM in vitro we incubate EHTs in TTRVI (5 µM, same as ATTR-CM plasma) or culture cardiac organoids
with TTRVI hepatic organoids (excretes TTRVI at a similar concentration) in an interconnected microphysiological
device for 14 days, resulting in cellular uptake, protein aggregation, lower PKG activity, cell death, and (in EHTs)
reduced function. Our new TTRVI knock in mouse develops diastolic dysfunction, increased expression of fibrotic
genes, and decreased PKG signaling. Males and ovariectomized female mice, but not intact females, develop
ATTR-CM, similar to human ATTR-CM which affects men and post-menopausal women. Our pilot data shows
activating PKG or expressing a Chip pS19-mimic (ChipSE) facilitates the clearance of TTRVI to enhance cardiac
function (mice and EHTs) and reduce cytotoxicity (organoids). This project will provide new mechanistic insight
into ATTR-CM by testing the impact of PKG activity and Chip pS19 in vitro and in vivo, tests a new therapeutic
strategy, and determines the translational relevance in human patients. Aim 1 tests if PKG stimulation or ChipSE
attenuates markers of ATTR-CM in vitro and the degradative process (proteasome or lysosome) utilized to
remove TTR. We also developed and will further test a novel tool (PROTAC) specifically targeting Chip for TTR
to enhance TTRVI removal. In Aim 2, we test the ability of various PKG activators protect against ATTR-CM and
if this occurs in a Chip pS20 dependent manner. In Aim 3, we will test the relevance of PKG signaling and Chip
pS19 in human ATTR-CM. We further interrogate myofilaments isolated from ATTR-CM human myocardium and
test if PKG activation can improve contraction and relaxation. The work is highly translational, as it provides key
mechanistic insight into and potentially identifies a new therapeutic target for ATTR-CM patients."
10883442,"Summary:
The sense of smell in the mouse largely occurs through the main olfactory system (MOS) which
has the amazing ability to detect trace amounts of an infinite variety of volatile organic ligands.
With this sensory power why does the mouse, and most terrestrial vertebrates, also have a
vomeronasal organ (VNO)? Some think that since the VNO was lost during human evolution it is
not important to study. First, we expect investigating the VNO will further advance our
understanding of all types of chemosensation. The presence of a robust VNO across
evolutionary diverse species indicates that taste and smell have functional blind spots that the
VNO is filling. Understanding the VNO will enable us to know if humans are missing an animal
superpower and can search for ways to augment our sensation, or if we evolved beyond its
tether; perhaps losing this system partially accounts for our remarkable behavioral flexibility.
Second, as an experimental model, the VNO provides unprecedented access to activate and
study circuits critically important to humans. VNO mediated behavior has accelerated
identification of neurons, circuits, and the brain network that underlies mouse social behavior
and provides mechanistic insight to analogous circuits implicated in human social behavior.
Anatomically, accessory olfaction has direct and privileged access to the social behavior brain
network and genetic ablation of this system results in aberrant, dysfunctional social
communication. Although humans are not thought to use olfaction to access social behavior
circuits, the downstream network is critical and dysfunction leads to autism, ADHD, anxiety, or
depression, but much is still unknown. Upon successful completion of this research, we will
have created datasets quantitatively detailing and simultaneously bridging major unknowns
about the accessory olfactory system: what it senses, metrics of neural activity encoding the
environment, and properties of sensory coding in relationship to behavior. Together, our
proposed work will investigate properties of VNO sensation that are expected to differ and
complement the function of the MOS. Our method enables us to gain first insight about evoked
sensory activity in relationship to the environment and behavior during dynamic natural behavior
and is expected to generate new insight about chemosensory function."
10883443,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An urgent child policy question facing the U.S. concerns how much and in what way to invest in
early care and education, particularly pre-kindergarten (pre-k). Rigorous evaluations of pre-k
programs within states have produced positive, negative, and null findings that are difficult to
reconcile, necessitating an approach that can integrate data across time and contexts. We ask
whether variations in investments by the 50 states across the past 20 years are associated with
better child health, achievement, and family outcomes. Our study will build on our previous
work in North Carolina (NC), which examined the effect of variation in pre-k funding to counties
across years on child outcomes using econometric analyses of panel data. Our first aim is to
evaluate whether the beneficial impacts of investments in public pre-k generalize
across the nation and with other estimation approaches. We will use this rigorous
method at the national level by compiling the first state-by-year-level dataset that integrates
pre-k funding, pre-k program features, state characteristics, and child and family outcomes (e.g.,
NAEP scores, anxiety, disability, maternal employment), applying a state- and year-fixed effects
approach. We also incorporate new NC data for an instrumental variables approach, using the
interaction between a family's proximity to the nearest NC Pre-K center and funding for pre-k as
an instrument for pre-k attendance—providing innovative causally-informative evidence of pre-
k effects. The second aim is to determine whether statewide investments in pre-k
promote equity in children's well-being across race, ethnic, and income groups. In
our nationwide study, we will test whether state investment levels have differential impact on
subgroups of children, and in NC, we will test whether our new analytic approaches demonstrate
equity-enhancing impacts on child achievement. The third aim is to examine whether
features of state pre-k programs and children's environments are associated with
differential impact of states' investments, which we test through moderation analyses of
carefully collected pre-k implementation data in each state and year. The fourth aim is to
examine whether prior NC Pre-K exposure protected children from the adverse
impact of COVID-19, by contrasting academic achievement for NC Pre-K attenders with a
matched group of non-attenders during pre- and post-COVID periods, as well as moderation of
hypothesized protective effects by schools' pandemic instructional policies (i.e., remote, hybrid).
Together, this work will inform child development theory about the enduring impact of early
education experiences and optimal policy strategies for promoting equitable learning outcomes."
10881565,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 While primary, early-stage breast cancer is curable, metastatic breast cancer remains a clinically significant
problem. Recent analyses of clinical samples have shown that the increased infiltration of sympathetic and
sensory nerve fibers into the mammary tumors, a phenomenon known as tumor innervation, is highly correlated
with metastatic potential of breast cancer. Despite recent interests in understanding breast tumor innervation,
there still exists a critical gap in fundamental knowledge in the molecular and cellular mechanisms of breast
tumor innervation. The goal of this project is to address this gap in knowledge by studying metabolic regulations
of breast tumor innervation and subsequent effects on metastasis.
 A wealth of literature suggests that metabolic dysregulation could in fact be linked to tumor innervation and
heightened metastatic potential. For instance, metabolic rewiring such as aerobic glycolysis and glutamine
addiction of cancer cells leads to changes in the tumor microenvironment that increases secretion of
neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, as well as pro-axonogenic
extracellular matrix components. Despite the obvious implications of blocking tumor innervation to reduce
metastatic frequency, the therapeutic potential of targeting metabolic rewiring to prevent breast tumor innervation
and curb metastasis has not yet been carefully evaluated.
 Therefore, we hypothesize that aerobic glycolysis and glutamine addiction in breast cancer promotes breast
tumor innervation leading to heightened metastasis. To test our hypothesis, we will utilize our tissue-engineered
3D culture platforms that have been optimized in-house to study tumor innervation. Our platforms comprise
tumor-mimetic collagen fiber organization and breast tumor microenvironment-mimetic decellularized adipose
tissue matrices. Notably, our platform can be monitored longitudinally live using optical redox imaging to
determine cell type-specific metabolic changes and its correlation with innervation. We will evaluate the link
between metabolic rewiring in tumor cells and heightened innervation (Aim 1) and metastatic potential of breast
cancer cells as a function of the amount of tumor innervation (Aim 2). Aim 3 will focus on analysis of deidentified
patient samples from primary and metastatic breast tumors to unravel association among metabolic profiles,
innervation, and clinical metastatic outcomes. Mechanistic insights will be gained via pharmacological inhibitions
and genetic deletions of target metabolic enzymes and neurotrophin receptors. Outcomes of our research may
lead to not only knowledge gain on correlations among metabolic rewiring, innervation and metastasis, but also
novel strategies to curb metastatic breast cancer progression via interference on dysregulated cellular
metabolism and innervation. Importantly, our platforms can be broadened to study metabolic regulations of
cancer-nerve crosstalk in other types of non-neural cancers with proven malignant contributions from the nerves
via tumor innervation (e.g., lung, pancreas, colorectal, head and neck, skin, etc.)."
10884282,"Project Abstract
Intravenously injected nanoparticulate drugs are cleared by phagocytes and elicit immune reactions,
including cytokine release and pseudoallergy (up to 10% in Doxil® and 30% in Onpattro®). There is
substantial preclinical evidence on the involvement of the serum complement system in these
responses. Understanding the mechanisms of complement activation in patients and designing
preventive strategies can improve the safety and efficiency of nanoparticle-based drugs. We found
that cell membrane-derived inhibitors of complement can effectively shut off complement activation
and prevent the uptake of nanoparticles by leukocytes in the blood of healthy donors. Furthermore,
the inhibitors that are designed to target complement deposits on the nanoparticle surface showed
picomolar activity, for all nanoformulations we tested. The available data suggest a novel hypothesis
wherein less than 1% of nanoparticles act as initiators of the complement cascade. Our long-term
goal is to conduct a clinical trial of combination of nanomedicines with complement inhibitors. Such a
trial will provide the nanomedicine field with the ultimate answers on the role of complement in
hemocompatibility, clearance, and infusion reactions in humans. The main objectives of this proposal
are 1) to further understand mechanisms of complement initiation by nanoparticles; 2) to design a
rapid companion test to measure complement activation by nanoparticle-based drugs; 3) to study the
efficacy of nanoparticle-binding inhibitors in blood of defined cohorts of patients in vitro and in dogs.
This research will shift the existing paradigm of stealth design: it will enable the control and fine-
tuning of the biocompatibility of nano-sized drug delivery and imaging systems using specific
inhibitors."
10883457,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In June 2022, a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court ended the federally protected right to abortion established
by Roe v Wade almost 50 years ago. In response to this decision, 26 states are poised to limit abortion access,
affecting approximately 36 million women of reproductive age and an unknown number of trans men and non-
binary people capable of pregnancy. The consequences of this dramatic shift in access to legal abortion in the
U.S. are unknown, and comparisons to circumstances before Roe are insufficient for understanding the potential
implications of the momentous policy change. Today, residents of states that do not offer legal abortion services
are faced with the following options: travel to an out-of-state abortion clinic, potentially experiencing considerable
logistic and financial burdens; order medication abortion pills online to safely self-manage their abortions; attempt
less safe abortion methods; or carry their pregnancies to term.
This study is uniquely positioned to document these pregnancy outcomes and the immediate and long-term
effects of this shift in policy. Using rapid-response funds from private sources, we have launched a longitudinal
observational study to examine the health and economic consequences faced by individuals who sought
abortions immediately following the implementation of a statewide abortion ban compared with those who were
legally served just prior to ban implementation. Within days of the Supreme Court decision, we began collecting
data from both groups through self-administered online surveys and invited participants to complete follow-up
surveys every 2 months for 2 years. This proposal seeks support for an expanded mixed-methods study design
that will include longitudinal survey data analysis, expanded recruitment to from clinics and abortion-access
helplines that provide information and resources to people in states with abortion bans, and the integration of
qualitative in-depth interviews seeking to understand the nuances of people’s experiences and decisions in this
new legal landscape. We will address three aims. In Aim 1, we will examine the long-term consequences of state
abortion bans, using multilevel multivariable regression models to compare health and economic outcomes
among individuals who received an abortion prior to ban implementation, sought an abortion at an out-of-state
clinic, sought an abortion outside of the legal medical system, or carried a pregnancy to term. In Aim 2, we will
assess the effectiveness of abortion-access helplines for mitigating negative outcomes by examining
associations between participants’ reported helpline experiences and their decisions to continue seeking an
abortion, their success in obtaining an abortion elsewhere, and the timing of successful abortion attempts. In
Aim 3, we will deepen our understanding of people’s abortion ban experiences by conducting in-depth interviews
and integrating findings with survey responses, focusing on populations especially vulnerable to poor outcomes.
Achieving these aims will provide valuable evidence that can inform state abortion policy decisions and the
development of harm-reduction strategies for pregnant people in states without access to legal abortion."

Abstract
The National Resource for Translational and Developmental Proteomics (NRTDP) has invested significant
resources into a discovery pipeline that efficiently generates interesting candidate proteoforms for further
investigation. While these experiments produce valuable insight into cell and disease biology, they are labor
intensive and relatively low throughput, thus rendering application of this pipeline to larger sample cohorts
significantly challenging. Therefore, we propose the development of a complementary targeted quantitative
workflow enabling further interrogation of interesting proteoforms in a high throughput modality with enhanced
sensitivity. Automated immunoprecipitation will provide the foundation of this new platform. Here, we will draw
on the experience of our collaborators at Thermo Pierce, who have validated thousands of antibodies and
implemented automated immunocapture using the KingFisher Flex system. Once immunoprecipitated, samples
will be resolved via liquid chromatography, ultimately transitioning to the CESI 8000 capillary electrophoresis
system from Sciex for improved sensitivity. For each target, we will develop a proteoform reaction monitoring
(PfRM) assay that validates and quantitates all of the proteoforms present at stoichiometric levels. The resulting
data will be processed using a new software platform, PFRM VIEWER, with the finalized PfRM assays made freely
available to the scientific community through a portal on the Resource website. These combined innovations will
enable the Resource to advance further down the pathway to translational proteomics by confirming observations
in larger populations while also providing a roadmap for community members to implement these assays within
their own respective research initiatives."

More than 400,000 children present annually to emergency departments (EDs) in the U.S. with chief
complaints of headaches. A small but meaningful proportion (0.5-1%) of these children will have abnormalities
in the brain requiring emergent identification, such as tumors, bleeding, or strokes. However, a much larger
proportion undergo neuroimaging of the brain in the ED, with up to one-third of children with headaches being
unnecessarily exposed to the risks associated with neuroimaging. The most prominent of these risks is a lethal
malignancy due to radiation from computed tomography (CT) scanning. The primary reason for the overuse of
neuroimaging in the ED is the lack of clarity regarding which clinical characteristics, or “red flag” findings,
accurately identify children with headaches who are at risk of having emergent brain abnormalities. Current
red flag findings were discovered from studies that were limited in their methods and/or had small numbers of
patients; in fact, frequently used red flag findings (e.g. headache waking the patient from sleep) are common
and non-specific, with certain findings occurring in as many as 30-40% of children with headaches. The long-
term goal of our research is to widely implement a decision support tool that will help clinicians make balanced
and informed decisions based on precise estimates of the risk of emergent brain abnormalities in children with
headaches. The goal of the current study is to generate the definitive evidence that will allow clinicians to
identify the risks of emergent brain abnormalities in otherwise healthy children presenting to EDs with
headaches. The primary aim of our current study is to derive and internally validate a decision tool that
stratifies the risk for children presenting to EDs with headaches. This model will use clinically sensible and
reliable factors to identify children at near-zero risk of emergent brain abnormalities with near perfect accuracy.
We will accomplish this aim by conducting a prospective multicenter research study in which we enroll 28,000
children 2 to 17-years-old with headaches presenting to one of 18 EDs in the Pediatric Emergency Care
Applied Research Network (PECARN). We will prospectively collect a comprehensive list of history and
physical examination findings for these patients and use sophisticated statistical modeling analyses to derive a
model to stratify risk. We aim to derive a model which is highly accurate for identifying patients at near-zero
risk of emergent brain abnormalities. The availability of a decision tool which identifies children with near-zero
risk and higher risk of emergent brain abnormalities based on specific headache characteristics will
fundamentally improve how children with acute headaches are managed. This information will help optimize
the use of emergent neuroimaging, including the safe reduction of unnecessary neuroimaging in children."
10883192,"ABSTRACT
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) leads to severe brain damage, profound deficit, and death in ~40% of patients,
and aging is a key risk factor for poor outcome. At least 30% of ICH patients develop lung injury, including lung
infection and these patients have worse outcome. This implies that stroke, especially in aged population, affects
lung health, which may influence the stroke outcome. While the cause is multifactorial, aberrant immune (age-
and ICH-driven) responses play key role. Plasma CC-motif chemokine 11 (CCL11) increases with aging and the
principal receptor for CCL11 is CC-motif chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3). CCR3 expression on neutrophils (PMNs)
is low, however, under stress to lung and in presence of CCL11, the CCR3 on lung PMNs is induced. These
CCR3+ PMNs acquire “damaging” phenotype. With lung being one of largest reservoirs of PMNs, the CCR3+
PMNs upon release from lung could enter the ICH-affected brain and augment ICH injury.
Besides PMNs, CCR3 is expressed by microglia (MG), cells that are ultimately needed for hematoma clearance
and brain repair, but if polarized to the “damaging” type MG could contribute to adjacent tissue injury. Thus,
aging elevated CCL11 can robustly alter MG function impacting ICH.
Our preliminary results demonstrate: Elevation of CCL11 levels (by systemic repetitive delivery of CCL11 to
simulate aging) in mice increases PMNs in lung and increases their CCR3 expression. Lung PMNs from CCR3
knockout have suppressed “damaging” phenotype. Aging or ICH activates CCR3 expression on lung PMNs.
CCL11 delivered to lung of young mice subjected to ICH increases PMNs in the lung and aggravates neurological
deficits caused by ICH. PMNs from lung can infiltrate ICH-affected brain and PMNs depletion selectively in lung
of aged mice reduces brain infiltration of PMNs and mitigates neurological deficits after ICH. Systemic delivery
of a CCL11-neutralizing antibody (CCL11NA) into aged ICH mice reduces neurological deficits, PMNs influx to
ICH-affected brain, and it improves hematoma clearance. In the aged brain, CCR3 is mainly found in MG. In
MG, CCL11 reduces MnSOD expression and impairs phagocytic function by downregulating PPAR and its
target genes signifying a pro-inflammatory phenotype, and this is reversed with CCR3 inhibition.
Our hypothesis is: In aged animals, that have elevated CCL11, in response to ICH, (1) lung PMNs shift to
CCR3+ “damaging” type and infiltrate the brain after ICH, and (2) CCR3+ MG lose their “reparative” role
(phagocytic/anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidative). Together these augment ICH-induced damage. We predict that
inhibition of CCL11/CCR3 signaling will reverse this deleterious cascade and promote repair.
Our Aims are to define a role of age-enhanced CCL11/CCR3 signaling in lung PMN-mediated ICH pathology
and to determine if CCL11/CCR3 inhibition reveres age-associated “damaging” MG phenotype in ICH injury. We
stress that this study will establish a novel target for ICH treatment for elderly patients, based on understanding
pathological role of CCL11/CCR3 signaling."

Our proposal is in keeping with the objectives of the RFA to continue the excellent ongoing studies of the
consortium (CPDPC) to study the relationship between Chronic Pancreatitis (CP), Diabetes (DM) and Pancreatic
Cancer (PDAC). The Principal Investigators of this proposal (Drs. Chari and Maitra, both currently based at UT
MD Anderson Cancer Center, UTMDACC) have played key and substantial roles in the first cycle of the CPDPC.
First, they have served as co-leaders of the DM-PDAC working group, which has been responsible for the design
and conduct of the ongoing NOD study, which was inspired by a series of seminal observations made by Dr.
Chari in the 2000s. Second, Dr. Maitra has served as Co-PI of the Data Management and Coordination Center
(DMCC) of the CPDPC, which provides him with extensive familiarity with the inner workings of data
management and oversight required for accrual to NOD and other prospective cohorts. Third, Dr. Chari was
previously the site Co-PI of Mayo Clinic site, which has contributed to all aspects of CPDPC in the last cycle.
From the experience of the past 4.5 years, it is clear that successful recruitment of subjects to these studies
requires a mix of tertiary care hospitals (for PROCEED and DETECT cohorts), combined with access to large
primary care healthcare systems with integrated electronic medical record systems, information technology (IT)
support and infrastructure (for the NOD study). To this end, an Alliance of Texas and Louisiana investigators and
institutions overseen by the PIs at UTMDACC will recruit to ongoing CPDPC cohort studies. In addition, we
propose 6 ancillary studies that are ideally suited for performance by a collaborative consortium and significantly
advance our understanding of the interconnected pathologies of CP, PDAC and DM. In accordance with the
RFA, the Specific Aims of our proposal are to: Aim 1 a) Recruit subjects for PROCEED study: This will occur at
the University of Texas Health Sciences Center, Houston (UTHSC-H) and Memorial Hermann Health System,
both large volume gastroenterology practices that are well positioned to recruit patients for the PROCEED Study.
b) Recruit subjects for the DETECT study: The UTHSC-H will recruit patients for DETECT study c) Recruit
subjects for the NOD Study: The recruitment will occur through the Ochsner Clinic, Louisiana, a large, integrated
primary health system in Louisiana, which is also highly enriched for underrepresented minority population of
African Americans, who are known to harbor a preponderance of both DM and PDAC. Aim 2) Perform a series
of innovative ancillary studies to examine the association among CP, DM and PDAC: 6 such studies are outlined
in this proposal."
10883022,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Vitamin D deficiency is common in neonates born preterm and implicated the pathogenesis disease in several
organs, such as the lung and retina. In the kidney, vitamin D supplementation clearly prevents the loss of a
podocytes in animals with glomerular disease. The podocyte is a terminally differentiated cell vital to the integrity
of the glomerular filtration barrier, and podocyte loss leads to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Preterm birth is
associated with both increased podocyte loss and CKD. Despite the kidney being a major source for the active
form of vitamin D, little is known about either the effect of perinatal vitamin D deficiency on the developing kidney
or its association with long term kidney disease. The goal of this proposal is to understand the vitamin D pathway
in preterm neonates and the role of vitamin D in podocyte health in a preterm model. This goal is motivated by
our exciting observations of dysregulation of several components of vitamin D metabolism in a mouse model of
preterm birth. Preterm birth altered the expression of genes involved in vitamin D metabolism in the kidney
suggesting a local reduction of active form vitamin D (1,25 vitamin D) as well as decreased Nphs1 expression.
Nphs1 promotes podocyte differentiation, and its expression is regulated by vitamin D. The changes in gene
expression in the preterm kidneys support a novel mechanism for the lower podocyte number and CKD seen in
preterm neonates. We hypothesize that dysregulation of vitamin D metabolism (↓Cyp27b1, ↑Cyp24a1) in the
preterm kidney causes a local deficiency of 1,25 vitamin D, resulting in reduced Nphs1 expression, impaired
podocyte differentiation, deceased podocyte density and albuminuria. Potential therapeutic options to overcome
the vitamin D dysregulation in preterm neonates could include 1,25 vitamin D supplementation or maternal 25
vitamin D administration. To test our hypothesis, we propose two independent Aims investigating neonate and
maternal vitamin D dysregulation. In Aim 1, we will fully characterize vitamin D pathway by measuring systemic
and local (kidney) vitamin D metabolites along with a key regulators of vitamin D metabolism. To determine the
independent effect of activated vitamin D pathway on the podocyte, we will treat preterm mice just after birth with
active vitamin D or vitamin D antagonists. Our primary outcome will be albuminuria and secondary outcomes will
include podocyte density, urinary podocyte loss and glomerular number. We will assess the molecular
mechanisms by testing transcriptional changes at both single-cell and whole kidney resolution. In Aim 2, we will
determine the contribution of maternal vitamin D status on the kidney health of the offspring born preterm. We
will modify the vitamin D status of the dam with a vitamin D deficient diet or provide a high dose of 25 vitamin D
to the mother just before birth of the preterm pups to determine the effect on albuminuria in the offspring. Findings
from this study will provide the basis for a feasible clinical trial using nutritional modifications in neonates or
mothers to improve kidney health outcomes of those born preterm."
10881410,"The long-term goal of our research program is to define mechanisms regulating treatment responses and
disease complications in Crohn's Disease (CD). Persistent rates of ileal strictures requiring surgery despite
widespread use of anti-TNF therapy increase the urgency of this work. Interactions between intestinal
epithelial cells (IEC), macrophages, and fibroblasts mediate fibrostenosis in CD. The IEC NADPH oxidase
DUOX2 produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) to control mucosal microbes, while also regulating cellular
metabolism and repair via redox signaling. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase NOX2 complex produces ROS to
kill pathogens, while constraining inflammasome activation and excessive cytokine production. We found that
loss-of-function genetic variants in DUOX2, and loss-of-function genetic variants in CYBA, NCF1, NCF2, and
NCF4 comprising the NOX2 complex, were associated with higher rates of strictures. This suggested a novel
redox signaling mechanism constraining epithelial and macrophage dependent myofibroblast activation and
extra-cellular matrix (ECM) production. Our perturbagen bioinformatic analysis of the treatment naïve CD ileal
transciptome prioritized small molecules likely to inhibit inflammatory macrophage and fibroblast function and
prevent strictures.The overall objective of this project will be to utilize a novel induced pluripotent stem cell
(iPSC) derived macrophage:human intestinal organoid co-culture system to test mechanisms by which DUOX2
and NOX2 gene variants and candidate small molecules control intestinal epithelial cell and macrophage
mitochondrial function and inflammatory signals regulating tissue fibrosis. We hypothesize that DUOX2 and
NOX2 redox signaling regulates mitochondrial complex I assembly and function, thereby constraining
mitochondrial ROS dependent cytokines driving tissue fibrosis. Small molecules and monoclonal antibodies will
ameliorate pro-fibrotic effects of DUOX2 and NOX2 gene variants.
We will test this hypothesis in the following Aims:
Aim 1. Define mechanisms of tissue fibrosis in DUOX2var HIO. We will test DUOX2var regulation of epithelial
redox signaling, protein kinase A activity, and mitochondrial complex I respiration, and associated mitochondrial
ROS dependent TGFB secretion and HIO collagen production. The ability of candidate small molecules and
TGFB blockade to prevent pro-fibrotic effects of bacterial products upon DUOX2var HIO will be determined.
Aim 2. Define pro-fibrotic mechanisms of NOX2var macrophages. We will test NOX2var regulation of
macrophage redox signaling, protein kinase A activity, and mitochondrial complex I respiration, and associated
mitochondrial ROS dependent TL1A secretion and HIO collagen production. The ability of small molecules and
TL1A blockade to prevent pro-fibrotic effects of NOX2var macrophages upon isogenic HIOs will be determined.
These studies will advance precision medicine, by utilizing a platform we have developed to screen candidate
small molecules in patient-derived organoids with clinically important genotypes."

Asthma prevalence and morbidity is on the rise for recently migrated and multigenerational immigrant
communities. It is well established that length of stay in the U.S. and acculturation to be associated with
asthma in Latino/x/e communities. Yet, the mechanisms—in particular the environmental contributors— remain
largely unknown. North Richmond, South Fresno, and Southwest Stockton, California are three environmental
justice communities with large immigrant populations. As these immigrant-prominent communities reside near
environmental hazards, including frequented truck routes, there is an imperative to increase our understanding
of the short-term health effects of diesel exhaust pollution for individuals with asthma. In partnership with
community-based organizations from these communities, this proposal seeks to: 1) estimate the short-term
health effects of black carbon exposure on daily rescue medication use and symptom burden; 2) understand
how acculturative stress and discrimination may modify or enhance this association; 3) identify multilevel
protective factors that reduce the health effects of black carbon exposure in asthma; and 4) co-prioritize
protective strategies at the individual, household, and community level.
To accomplish these aims, we will enroll 300 Latine household with at least one residing child, 6–17 years old,
with asthma (100 households/community), use a GPS-enabled cap for inhalers to collect information on time
and place of rescue medication use, and set up a high-density black carbon sensor network and air quality
model to derive an hourly 100-meter black carbon concentration grid. We will then examine for health effects of
black carbon on rescue medication use and symptom burden using distributed lag models, examine for effect
modification by acculturative stress and discrimination markers, and identify multi-level protective factors.
These results will inform a community stakeholder engaged effort using a participatory action research
approach. This will involve working with our established Youth Council in Richmond, CA (to be extended to
Fresno and Stockton) to co-create and distribute a community-wide survey (n=600) and co-lead listening
sessions to iteratively prioritize promising protective strategies for consideration of inclusion in local community
emissions reduction plans.
At the conclusion of the study, we will have a nuanced understanding of the short-term health effects of diesel
exhaust pollution, measured as black carbon for this proposal, on daily asthma morbidity in Latine populations
residing near roadways and other environmental hazards. Furthermore, we will examine how acculturative
stress and discrimination may exacerbate this health disparity. Perhaps most impactful, we will not only identify
promising multi-level protective factors but also co-prioritize these strategies with our community partners."
10877484,"Bacterial infections pose one of the most significant global public health challenges, exacerbated by the
emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. As a result, treating these infections has become increasingly difficult.
Recently, the FDA approved cefiderocol, a siderophore-antibiotic conjugate, as a new treatment for urinary tract
infections (UTIs) caused by antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. This approval highlights the potential of
targeting the bacterial siderophore-mediated metal uptake process for pharmaceutical interventions. A crucial
step in this process involves the uptake of metal-chelated siderophores across the bacterial inner membrane,
facilitated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) importers. Unfortunately, the detailed molecular mechanisms
underlying these importers remains poorly understood, impeding the development of targeted drugs. This
proposal focuses on a unique example of these critical importers: the yersiniabactin importer YbtPQ from
uropathogenic E. coli, the leading cause of UTIs. Our preliminary studies have revealed that YbtPQ exhibits
folding characteristics similar to an ABC exporter, representing a novel type of ABC transporter. Building upon
this discovery, we expect to study the fundamental structure-function relationship of YbtPQ by pursuing two
specific aims: 1) Define the substrate selectivity and inhibitory mechanism of YbtPQ; 2) Understand the unique
structural motifs within YbtPQ. To accomplish these goals, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach,
combining mutagenesis, specifically-designed transport assays, microscale thermophoresis, circular dichroism,
native mass spectrometry, molecular dynamic simulations, and cryo-electron microscopy. Successful completion
of this proposal will yield valuable insights into the substrate/inhibitor selectivity and transport dynamics of YbtPQ.
This knowledge will serve as a solid foundation for future drug development targeting this importer, offering new
possibilities for effectively treating bacterial infections and addressing the challenges of antibiotic resistance."
10877483,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Neuropathy associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is frequently associated with pain and sensory loss. Our
incomplete mechanistic understanding of the pathophysiology of nerve injury in T2D hinders our ability to develop
more effective drugs and therapeutic strategies. Given the emerging role of myeloid cells, particularly
macrophages, across various types of neuropathy, their apparent involvement in diverse forms of nerve injury
pain and the known increase in production of the peptide hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) in diabetes, we posit
that elevated Ang II in T2D precipitates neuropathy, pain and sensory loss by disrupting myeloid cell development
and phenotype. However, many knowledge gaps persist.
 Our preliminary studies indicate that circulating immature myeloid cell numbers are increased in diet-induced
and genetic models of T2D, a change also associated with elevated levels of Ang II in lymphoid tissues.
Furthermore, the sensory gain observed in diet-induced T2D is reversible by inhibitors of Ang II production. The
overall goal of this project is to identify how Ang II disrupts myeloid cells in T2D, culminating in neuropathy,
sensory loss and pain.
 The first specific aim will assess the extent of alterations to myelopoiesis across the progression from
metabolic syndrome to early stage T2D to late-stage T2D, and whether increases in Ang II are causally related.
The second specific aim will determine the degree to which T2D modifies tissue-resident myeloid cell function in
ways that promote sensory dysfunction. Finally, the third specific aim will determine if opposing T2D-related
changes in angiotensin signaling can normalize pathological changes to myeloid cells, thereby reducing sensory
dysfunction.
 Our multidisciplinary approach involves preclinical T2D models, reflexive and voluntary pain-behavioral
studies, immunohistochemistry, in vitro live cell functional imaging, single cell RNA and ATAC-sequencing and
transcriptomic analysis of human skin biopsies. Our project will unambiguously dissect the nature of Ang II-based
myeloid cell disruption to determine the role of the renin-angiotensin system and macrophage-driven
inflammation in the development of peripheral neuropathy and chronic pain in T2D.
 Elucidating the mechanistic underpinnings of sensory loss and pain in T2D neuropathy is critical to advancing
our understanding of the underlying mechanism(s), as well as rapid translation into development of new-
generation, efficacious, non-opioid analgesics that target such neuro-immune crosstalk."
10874289,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacterial cells communicate through the language of molecular cues that are released into the
environment and detected by cells in nearby communities. While prevalent in every ecological
niche, pathogenic bacteria may exploit this molecular crosstalk to survive stress conditions,
escape immune detection, and evade the action of antibiotics. This project will investigate how
molecules that are derived from the bacterial cell wall regulate bacterial growth decisions using
the paradigm of bacterial dormancy in a prototypic uropathogenic strain of Escherichia coli. This
research will identify the pharmacophore of the cell wall signal, or cue, elucidate genes that enable
the bacterial response to the signal, and identify bacterial protein targets that engage the signal
to further understand the underlying mechanism of bacterial crosstalk. We propose an innovative,
multifaceted approach to understand this bacterial crosstalk by combining research methods in
synthetic chemistry, bacterial genetics, and ligand-capture proteomics. During the course of this
work, we will train undergraduate students majoring in Chemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology,
and Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences at Salve Regina University, a primarily
undergraduate institution (PUI), and the University of Rhode Island, a collaborating institution.
This training provides experiential learning objectives for undergraduate students, exposes them
to biologic-based interdisciplinary research, and promotes strong collaboration between faculty at

10876980,"Project Summary
For almost 50 years, scientists have investigated the relationship between eye movement control and the activity
of neurons in the frontal eye field (FEF), superior colliculus (SC) and lateral intraparietal area (LIP). The general
findings of these studies have been that neurons in all three areas are important for eye movement behavior,
but they have identified very few differences between the areas, implying that they all do similar things. Recently,
a small number of labs have started using more naturalistic free-viewing behavioral tasks and have found a
number of substantive differences in neural responses across these areas, suggesting that they each play a
unique role. Based on these data, we formed a hypothesis about the roles of each area and how they may
function as a network to generate behavior. Briefly, we have proposed that LIP acts as simple priority map that
is constantly accessible, FEF activity controls the timing of saccades and SC activity represents the final decision
about where to look. In addition, a subset of neurons in FEF keeps track of where the animal has looked. Building
on this previous work, the current proposal has two main aims. The first is to fill in two gaps of our knowledge
that are essential in finalizing our hypothesis. As part of this aim, we propose to record from SC neurons in a
free viewing visual foraging task to confirm that SC activity is not affected by stimulus identity in ongoing search.
We also propose to record from FEF neurons in an even more natural version of our task to make sure that
suppression we have previously seen during maintained fixation is a mechanism for controlling the timing of eye
movements as opposed to a mechanism related to reward expectation. The results of these studies will refine
our hypothesis and set us up for the second main aim of the proposal, which is to test whether our hypothesized
roles are functionally valid. This second aim is broken into 3 components. In each, we will causally test aspects
of our hypothesis. In the first experiment, we will microstimulate LIP at different times to test whether the
suppression we have identified in FEF controls the flow of information from LIP to guide saccades. In the second
experiment, we will inactivate LIP while recording from FEF and SC. The results of this experiment will test the
hypothesis that LIP activity drives saccadic behavior via FEF and SC and, if it does not, these recordings should
identify which area does play a role in guiding behavior. In the third experiment, we will inactivate FEF while
recording from SC. This will allow us to test three additional aspects of our hypothesis: whether FEF activity
guides behavior and whether this is also represented in SCI; whether the tracking signal in FEF in functionally
relevant; and whether the activity in FEF is involved in controlling the temporal flow of saccades. These results
will solve a decades-long question of why we have multiple brain areas by providing a clear indication of what
the roles of LIP, FEF and SC are in everyday visual behavior. Given that patients across a broad spectrum of
neurological diseases have abnormal eye movement behavior, these results may aid in the development of
pharmacological or behavioral methods to combat these problems."
10877099,"Project Summary
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) typically produces extensive central vision loss, leading to difficulty in
reading, navigating, and other critical tasks. Current assistive devices for vision with central scotomas, while
promising, are limited in effectiveness. This proposal aims to fill this gap by advancing understanding of
remapping, a method that improves the effectiveness of patients’ residual vision by shifting information from
inside the central blind spot (scotoma) to intact locations in the visual field. Only a handful of past studies have
examined remapping, including just a single study of patients. Our group recently demonstrated the method’s
promise, showing that it can improve reading substantially in observers with simulated field loss. Critically,
patients differ widely in the shape of their scotomas, and the quality of their vision across the visual field. This
variability imposes severe limitations on the “one size fits all” remapping approaches used in prior work, that
simply shift the image away from the scotoma center. If, for example, a patient’s preferred retinal location
(used for high acuity tasks) is near the lower left edge of their scotoma, shifting text upward or rightward may
not aid reading as much as shifting it downward, as the latter will place the text in regions of best visual acuity.
This proposal will test the value of personalized remappings, which shift the image in a way that is optimized
for each patient’s residual vision. The remappings are constructed using a novel letter recognition perimetry
task, which measures performance across the visual field: The personalized remappings are constructed to
shift text to maximize observers’ total letter recognition ability. Proposed work will first test the hypothesis that
personalized remapping can improve single word recognition. Single word reading will be measured with a
variety of scotoma sizes, shapes, and PRL locations. Performance with personalized remapping will be
compared to that with traditional remapping and no remapping in both control observers with simulated
scotomas and people with macular degeneration. Proposed work will also test the hypothesis that personalized
remappings can improve free reading. Reading speed, error rates, and eye movement patterns will be
measured in a sentence reading task, and in free reading of natural images containing text. Preliminary data
support the value of remapping generally, and the potential of the letter recognition perimetry task for building
personalized remappings. Results of this proposal will provide the first thorough testing of remapping, and will
also inform models of peripheral reading in patients and controls. The proposed studies will develop and
evaluate a novel method for assisting people with low-visions, tailored to their individual residual performance.
Personlaized remapping may also be incorporated into practical visual aids to improve daily visual function and
quality of life."

1. Enrich and Enhance the ROBOKOP graph knowledgebase. We will enhance the data and infrastructure
of the ROBOKOP KB. Aim 2. Provide tools to explore the ROBOKOP graph knowledgebase. We will
enhance the ROBOKOP KG by developing and employing novel reasoning tools for KG mining and edge
inference. Aim 3. Prove utility and promote use of the ROBOKOP graph knowledgebase through impactful
use cases. We will conduct several collaborative proof-of-concept research applications in diverse biomedical
domains and diseases. We will actively promote community engagement, user acceptance, and broader
impact of ROBOKOP. We expect that our diverse, cutting-edge approach to research, development, and
community engagement, coupled with our high-impact biomedical applications, will lead to the formation of a
core group of regular users, promote long-term sustainability, and generate impactful new scientific knowledge

Neuromodulation is a rapidly growing field of study that encompasses a wide spectrum of neurotechnology that
can manipulate neural circuits for treating nervous system disorders. To accelerate clinical translation of
neuromodulation therapies, there is a strong need to train the next generation of scientists, engineers, and
clinicians who have the knowledge base and circuit-interrogating tools to investigate nervous system disorders,
the principled biophysical understanding of how neuromodulation affects neural tissue, the communication and
scientific skills to work in multi-disciplinary teams, and the ability to navigate the translational pathways
necessary to bring new discoveries and technologies to clinical practice. The mission of this T32 program is to
train a diverse group of post-doctoral fellows, provide them with world-class opportunities to develop and
translate neuromodulation technologies, and launch their careers as the next generation of leaders in the field
of translational neuromodulation research. The training program will pair post-doctoral fellows with faculty co-
mentors from (1) fundamental neuroscience or neuroengineering fields and (2) clinical disciplines. Fellows will
conduct translational research with program faculty who are pioneers in the clinical translation of (a) deep brain
stimulation therapies for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, (b) spinal cord stimulation for post-injury
restoration of volitional movement and autonomic function, (c) peripheral nerve stimulation for treatment of
cardiometabolic and inflammatory disorders, and (d) techniques for manipulating the spread of brain cancer.
Fellows will participate in a clinical immersion and have the opportunity to integrate and lead aspects of
research projects that are already in human clinical trials or near the threshold for first-in-human studies. The
training program will also engage a cohort of resident- or fellowship-level physicians (“clinical associates”) who
can devote one year of protected and already funded research time. All trainees will further develop their skills
in rigorous statistical data analysis, experimental design methodologies, research quality assurance, and
responsible conduct of research through hands-on workshops. We will also train the cohort of fellows and
clinical associates through a translation and commercialization bootcamp with follow-up workshop sessions.

 There are >20,000 genes in the genome and though there has been progress in assigning many gene
functions, we still do not know the function of numerous genes or their specific roles in affecting disease. Genes
can direct diverse phenotypes in different cell types, cell states, or tissues, which makes gene annotation a
staggering task. Studies are needed to determine each gene’s function in different contexts, but the scope of the
problem is a challenge – it is necessary to assess many possible functions of 100s of genes and within the
context of a complex cellular and extracellular milieu whose spatial architecture is an essential component of
system behavior. In addition, some genes work coordinately or redundantly with other genes, making phenotypic
annotation more challenging. Establishing the role of every gene in different normal and disease states would
have an incalculable impact on biology and medicine. It would elicit novel intrinsic components of different
diseases and thus facilitate the development of drugs to treat some of these diseases.
 The objective of this project is to establish a first-of-its-kind platform for spatial functional genomics (Perturb-
map), which will enable 100s of genetic perturbations, including multi-gene knockouts, to be generated in parallel
in tissues and tumors, and the effect of each perturbation on multiple intrinsic and extrinsic biological processes
to be revealed at cellular, subcellular, and tissue level resolution. To reach our objective, we will develop novel
technologies, methods, and software tools that will permit 100s of CRISPRs, along with dozens of biological
phenotypes, to be spatially resolved within a tissue by high-dimensional imaging. To establish the potential of
Perturb-map to address urgent unmet needs, we will apply the platform to one of the most pressing questions in
immune oncology, namely how tumors prevent immune infiltration and subvert immunity. We will use Perturb-
map to identify factors that regulate immune recruitment and exclusion from the tumor microenvironment and
uncover genes controlling tumor resistance to immune clearance.
 The outcome of this project will be a transformative technology for functional genomics with spatial cellular
and sub-cellular resolution and high-dimensional phenotyping. This would have unmatched capabilities to
answer numerous questions in a broad array of biological areas, and to investigate entire classes of genes and
phenotypes that could not be studied with existing functional genomics approaches; enabling highly scaled
studies to identify genes that control processes such as: tissue and tumor organization, cell migration, invasion
and metastasis, cell-cell interactions, and local immune cell recruitment and crosstalk. By being able to
interrogate multiple gene perturbations within the same cell, Perturb-map will also enable genetic redundancies
and synthetic lethal relationships to be identified, a major area of interest for development of targeted cancer
therapies. Thus, the platform will have broad utility in numerous areas of basic and translational biology."

Naturally occurring bioactive compounds are extensively studied as anticancer agents, particularly for
therapeutic intervention. It is estimated that about 25% of all newly approved anticancer drugs are derived
from natural products. Although, several bioactive natural products were studied and proven to be efficacious
in preclinical models, their progress to clinic remains elusive due to lack of specificity toward one desired
clinically relevant interceptive target(s). Thus, UG3/UH3 RFA “Discovery and Development of Natural
Products for Cancer Interception and Prevention” takes the advantage of the world’s largest, most diverse
libraries of pre-fractionated natural products from NIH-NCATS resources to screen and identify bioactive
fractions which target clinically relevant interception pathways of colorectal cancer (CRC). These targets are
microsomal prostaglandin E synthease-1 (mPGES-1), 5-Lipoxygease (5-LOX) and ornithine decarboxylase
(ODC). mPGES-1, 5-LOX, and ODC are highly over-expressed in colonic preneoplastic lesions and their
metabolites PGE2, 5-HETE/Leukotrienes, and polyamines play a critical role in tumor progression. The
rationale to select these clinically relevant targets is based on the fact that, i) there is a lack of highly selective
natural agents which target mPGES-1, 5-LOX, and ODC at non-toxic doses; ii) targeting mPGES-1/5-LOX
may spare PGI2 (antithrombotic) and avoid cardiovascular risk; and iii) combining inhibitors of PGE2 and
polyamines would provide synergistic inhibition of CRC. Based on the above rationale, we propose the
following Aims/goals for UG3 and UH3 phases. Goals of UG3: 1. Establish optimal HTS assays for mPGES-
1, 5-LOX, and ODC using purified proteins and ~1,500 natural product fractions from NCATS;
2. Establish and test secondary assays for selectivity, and activity, using cell-based assays and further
validate targets and growth inhibition in organoid assays; and 3. Evaluate the off-targets and cellular toxicites
associated with natural product selective inhibitors mPGES-1, 5-LOX, and ODC.
Goals of UH3: 1. Conduct full scale evaluation of the Natural Products Libraries in collaboration with NCATS
through NCI assistance (350,000 - 500,000 natural product samples/fractions) in HTS as potential cancer
interception agents; 2. Isolation and structural elucidation by MicroED of active natural compound(s) based
on selective inhibition of mPGES-1, 5-LOX, and ODC. Followed by scaling up of lead molecules; and
3. Determine the Ex-Vivo and In-Vivo inhibitory effect of bioactive natural product compounds on mPGES-1,
5-LOX, ODC and its metabolism and efficacy in CRC interception."

 Since 2011, the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) has been working on
cooperative agreements with FDA and other partners to build training and certification for the
integrated food safety system (IFSS) as mandated by the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA).
 This work has created a wealth of valuable educational and training resources, including the
National Curriculum Standard (NCS). The NCS is an educational roadmap that can help build food safety
regulatory capacity from the entry level through leadership. Inside this map, the waypoints are the
knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to achieve the public health goal of keeping the food supply safe
and wholesome. There is still much work to be done in developing education and training for every
aspect of the NCS in human food, animal food, and laboratory regulatory needs. NEHA will continue to
bring expertise and cooperation to the table.
 As this development continues to take place, there is also a need to persist in teaching today’s
regulatory workforce on the scientific knowledge, tools, and techniques needed to regulate the food
supply with the goal of keeping food safe. This ongoing work will continue, using online resources for
the core knowledge elements, and face-to-face experiential learning that puts this knowledge into
practice. NEHA will continue to be a leader in this area as we refine adult learning principles such as
immersive teaching techniques, peer-to-peer learning, and kinesthetic experiences.
 To complete the lifecycle of learning, NEHA will continue to measure knowledge learned
through formative and summative assessments and will reach out to participants post-training to
determine retention and usage of knowledge. Information gained from this and course evaluations will
be used to hone the courses as part of a total quality improvement plan.
 In addition, the recent COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent stay-at-home orders have made it
clear that alternative education and training mechanisms must continue to be developed and refined to
not just impart information, but to reach adult learners with the same intellectual impact as interactive
face-to-face trainings. In fact, during the first week of April 2020, over 11,500 downloads of e-learning
content occurred on the NEHA learning management system (LMS). NEHA will continue to improve the
way we develop online resources and teach in a virtual environment as part of this cooperative
agreement."

Mutation of HCFC1 causes a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by inborn errors of cobalamin
metabolism, intractable epilepsy, intellectual disability, and motor dysfunction. Despite an implication for HCFC1
in these neurological impairments, a mechanism describing the function of HCFC1 during brain development
has not been completely elucidated. HCFC1 encodes for a transcriptional co-factor protein known to regulate
cellular proliferation of various progenitor cells including neural precursor cells (NPC). NPCs undergo rapid
expansion during early brain development and differentiate into all the major cell types in the brain (i.e. neurons,
glia). To begin to elucidate a putative mechanism for HCFC1 in NPC expansion, we created the Co60 allele
which introduces a loss of function mutation in the zebrafish hcfc1a ortholog. Through immunohistochemical
labeling and cell counts, we demonstrated that heterozygous carriers of the Co60 allele (Co60/+) had increased
proliferation of NPCs. We next used transcriptomics of Co60/+ whole brain homogenates to reveal a 14-fold
increase in the expression of asxl1, a transcription factor critical for cell proliferation and activation of AKT
signaling. We found that inhibition of PI3K, an upstream activator of AKT, in Co60/+ mutants restored asxl1
dependent NPC over proliferation. Moreover, preliminary western blotting and densitometry analysis of our
mutants confirm hyperphosphorylation of AKT (Thr308). We next used chromatin immunoprecipitation to confirm
a direct binding of human HCFC1 to the zebrafish asxl1 promoter. Together, these findings indirectly link for the
first time hcfc1a function and asxl1 expression with AKT activation and NPC proliferation. What remains to be
understood is the level of AKT signaling in isolated NPCs derived from hcfc1a mutants and which AKT
downstream signaling molecules, like mTOR, regulate proliferation. Completion of this study will help to identify
novel molecular pathways that regulate brain development downstream of HCFC1 and pinpoint mechanisms as
to how its dysregulation contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders. During the F99 phase of this award, I seek
to gain working knowledge of techniques in molecular biology that include protein isolation, western
immunoblotting, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), flow cytometry, advanced imaging, and behavioral
neuroscience. Additionally, I aim to refine my skills and obtain professional development in grantsmanship,
manuscript review and preparation, build and maintain my science network, and finalize my dissertation

10878900,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) remain one of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus (DM) and are
the leading cause of lower extremity amputation with every sixth individual suffering an early demise as a result.
Many complicating factors of DM contribute and interrupt normal physiologic healing processes. Five-year
mortality after DFU occurrence is 40% and is 10-fold higher than non-diabetic cohorts. Despite major scientific
advances in the understanding of wound healing physiology, only one-half of DFUs heal when standard of care
is met. This unfortunate truth highlights the need to identify modifiable risk factors for healing that may be the
cause of non-healing events in the treatment of DFUs.
 The DFU microbiome may represent these important modifiable risk factors in obtaining wound healing. The
DFU microbiome is comprised of the genetic material of all the microbiota that cohabitate the DFU. Past
observational studies have implicated one or more of these microbiotas as contributors to non-healing, but these
studies have suffered from significant design limitations and lack consensus assessment. Most studies were
only cross-sectional in design and focused primarily on non-infected DFUs. Furthermore, these studies did not
collect biospecimens consistently across studies. In this career development, we propose to understand the role
of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of DFU and understand the trajectories of the microbiome across DFU
wound progression in three aims. Aim 1 will perform a cross-sectional cohort of patients with DFU to compare
the microbiome of those with DFI to infection-free DFUs using metagenomics next generation sequencing
(mNGS). Aim 2 will leverage this initial cohort to longitudinally determine the temporal relationships and
interactions between pathogen presence, wound healing, and development of infection. Aim 3 will assess the
clinical feasibility of using mNGS to predict antibiotic therapy against identified pathogens in infected DFU in a
pilot clinical trial. The overall goal of this project is to identify modifiable risk factors in the DFU microbiome that
will lead to interventional clinical trials to prevent and/or treat DFUs.
 This proposal is essential to my career development. I will become an independent clinical researcher with
expertise in diabetic foot complications. The formal training in clinical trial execution and biostatistics will provide
practical experiences and will set the stage for successful completion of not only this project, but also of future
investigations. The clinical trial component of my career development will allow me to take the results from this
study and seamlessly transition into interventional studies that will lead to new treatments for patients suffering
from DFUs. Drs. Rodica Pop-Busui and Keith Kaye are ideally suited as mentors for this project with their
complementary expertise in diabetes, neuropathy, infectious disease, and clinical trial experience. The vast
resources of the University of Michigan, including the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research and
the School of Public Health, will significantly contribute to the successful completion of this proposal."

10904875,"Project Summary
Light-scattering opacities responsible for age-related cataracts are a result of aggregation and precipitation of
the lens crystallins (α, β, and γ-crystallins). The α-crystallins (αA and αB isoforms) assemble as polydispersed
oligomeric complexes and function as ATP-independent molecular chaperones (i.e., protein hold-ases). Both of
these properties are thought to guard against aggregation events that would disrupt the delicate proteostasis of
the lens. It is known that environmental stress and chemical modifications that accrue over our lifetimes
destabilize the lens crystallins, and induce complex forms of protein-protein interactions that lead to
aggregation (amorphous and potentially fibril). However, a major hurdle to understanding the aggregation
pathways associated with cataracts, has been the lack of structural information on the major lens α-crystallins.
This gap in knowledge is due to the lack of effective methods to characterize the inherently polydispersed
structure of α-crystallin, the heterogeneity of chaperone-client aggregate formations, and evasiveness of fibril
aggregation states identified under physiological conditions. In this proposal, we describe our multidisciplinary
team-based approach, centered around the PI's expertise in the enabling technology of single particle CryoEM,
that will finally allow us to interrogate the basis of α-crystallin molecular plasticity. Specifically, we aim to define
high-resolution structures of the α-crystallins in their intrinsic polydispersed states (Aim 1), resolve key
structural intermediates (aka “pre-aggregation states”) induced under saturating client conditions (Aim 2), and
characterize a novel mechanism of fibrillogenesis discovered by our laboratory that is accessible to αB-
crystallin under cellular conditions (Aim 3). Structural studies will be complimented by biophysical and
functional characterization, performed in collaboration with Prof. Kirsten Lampi (OHSU), with the aim of
illuminating mechanistic principles that define α-crystallin structure, polydispersity and stability – which are
critical to avoidance of aggregation in the lens and therefore key to future success of drug-design strategies
targeted at controlling age-related cataracts (and a range of other human crystallin-opathies)."

Our program includes close mentoring with selection of specific research projects within the first year of the program, well-defined course work, and unique training in the evaluation and treatment of patients with acute stroke and neurocritical care. Our post-doctoral training program has been training neurologists for 22 years and emergency physicians formally for 16 years with the goal of producing academic leaders and clinical researchers in the area of cerebrovascular disease and neurocritical care. The last 15 years of our program have included funding by this T32. Since the initiation of the T32, we have developed a very robust neurocritical care training pathway which we have included as part of this T32 training program. This innovative and multi-disciplinary training model has been advocated by the NIH roadmap and by the NIH-funded Centers for Clinical and Translational Science and Training (CCTST). Our training program is comprised of an extensive network of collaborators and mentors that has resulted in academic productivity among our graduates. Training draws on faculty with expertise in acute stroke therapy and clinical trial methodology/management, genomics, hemorrhagic stroke, animal models and in-vitro models of stroke and vascular physiology, traumatic brain injury, methods of neurocritical care, neuroepidemiology, biostatistics, neuro-interventional therapy (endovascular and surgical), neuroimaging, neurorecovery, neurosonology, neurotechnology development, outcome research, stroke prevention, ethical design of research, HIPAA compliance, and data-base management.

No prophylactic or therapeutic regimen is known for any prion disease. The BSE outbreak in cattle with
the subsequent emergence of a new and transmissible human prion disease (vCJD) highlights the public
health threat from prion diseases. The commonalities among mammalian prion diseases are quite
remarkable 1. The ongoing and expanding major threat from prion disease in North America is chronic
wasting disease (CWD). CWD is an emergent rapidly spreading disease in cervids 2 with uncertain zoonotic
potential 3. Approximately 9 million Americans hunt deer and elk 4 with an estimated 7,000-15,000 CWD-
infected cervids consumed annually (increasing 20%/yr) 5. As hunting is a roughly $26 billion (per annum) 4
industry, CWD also represents an enormous potential health and economic threat. We have developed novel
vaccine strategies which show promise in animal models 6-8 and have established a carefully-graded CWD
challenge 9,10 in tandem with a longitudinal monitoring system in our unique indoor-housed white-tailed deer
facility 10-14, permitting CWD vaccine assessment in the native host.
We propose 3 aims to determine the ability of homologous or heterologous immunization strategies to protect
deer from CWD infection and mitigate prion shedding. In Aim 1 we will determine the efficacy and safety of
CWD vaccines that have complementary targets, a highly innovative and rationally designed vaccine which
targets PrPSc 8,15 and a second vaccine strategy which aims at eliminating the substrate for prion conversion
 7,16, and whether combining the vaccines is more effective. In Aim 2 we will determine if these vaccine
strategies, alone or in combination, protect deer from CWD infection. Aim 3 will further determine if vaccination
reduces prion shedding in excreta and secreta (urine, feces and saliva) of CWD challenged deer, thereby
reducing infection between cervids and environmental contamination.
The translational impact of the results of these studies will:
 a) develop prototype vaccine candidates for prion diseases
 b) provide management tools for the cervid industry and wildlife management
 c) mitigate the risks of zoonotic transmission of cervid prions.
Thereby, this research will have immediate impacts in both human and animal health."

With the most people ever in history currently living with HIV, stopping the HIV epidemic remains imperative.
Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) limits viral replication, but is not curative. Thus, there is an urgent need
to design a functional cure via elimination of the viral reservoir. Timothy Brown, aka the Berlin Patient, and Adam
Castillejo, aka the London patient, were cured of HIV following leukemia-related, MHC-matched, allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a CCR5-deficient donor. Using our allogeneic HSCT model
in Mauritian cynomolgus macaque (MCM), we have demonstrated that the allogeneic immune response can
potently purge the latent reservoir, but is ultimately insufficient due to susceptibility to infection. This underscores
the need for CCR5 deficient donors to fully eradicate HIV in the setting of HSCT. During the course of our
previous studies we have demonstrated that the CCR5-specific antibody Leronlimab can mimic a CCR5 deficient
donor by occupying all available CCR5 molecules. We are now proposing to utilize Leronlimab in the setting of
allogeneic HSCT to definitely demonstrate the mechanism by which CCR5 deficiency achieves HIV cure. In
specific aim 1, we will measure the effect and determine the mechanism of Leronlimab administration during the
peri-transplant period in SHIV-infected, ART-suppressed MCM undergoing allogeneic HSCT. In specific aim 2,
we will measure if Leronlimab administered during the peri-transplant period in an HIV+ patient undergoing
allogenic HSCT for cancer treatment can replicate a CCR5-deficient donor and mediate an HIV cure. This work
would expand our knowledge of the mechanism of HIV cure in the setting of allogeneic HSCT and establish a
new therapeutic treatment for HIV cure."

Imagine baking a croquembouche, a new culinary challenge. How many steps ahead in the recipe will you bother
to remember? Of course, you can always refer back to the recipe itself, so you needn’t remember much.
Everyday tasks involve strategic trade-offs between sampling (utilizing the external resources provided by stable
objects and symbols in the visual world) versus remembering (utilizing the internal resources of working
memory). Here our goal is to answer the question: When it’s up to you, how much will you remember?
 Historically, working memory has been measured under ideal conditions – well-informed, motivated
participants doing simple tasks – to isolate best-case performance. Estimates of WM from these types of studies,
however, provide a challenge for generalization: real-world conditions are not ideal and performance is rarely
best-case. Our view, captured by our dynamic feedback model, is that an individual trades off sampling versus
remembering in order to strike a preferred balance between the subjective costs of using external
resources (the overhead of having to refer to information in the environment) with the subjective costs of
using internal resources (the cognitive effort required to maintain task-relevant information in WM).
 Nearly all of the previous empirical work investigating the sampling-remembering trade-off has been with
adults. This leaves a tremendous gap in our understanding since the optimal use of internal resources such as
WM is even more crucial when those resources are more limited, as in children. We developed an innovative
“Shopping Game”, a child-friendly, tablet-based paradigm where children are shown a shopping list, then
asked to select those items from a virtual store. Since the list is long, and the list and store are not visible at the
same time, the child must toggle back and forth between the two. Through the parametric variation of time delays
to access the store or the list, we will independently manipulate the subjective costs to use those internal and
external resources, and through pupillometry, we will track moment-to-moment cognitive effort deployment.
Importantly, we propose to study these mechanisms in a large longitudinal study of 6-7-year-old children,
during a period right after school entry, when children are first faced with cognitive tasks that require
memorization. Children’s steadily increasing WM capacity during this period provides a unique opportunity to
test predictions of our model that could not be tested in adults.
 Combining psychophysics, pupillometry, and standardized cognitive assessments, we will conduct a
critical multi-method, naturalistic test of how the cognitive control mechanisms of working memory use develop.
Our project will provide (1) the first model-based analysis of the sampling-remembering trade-off and (2)
the first direct, longitudinal study of the deployment of cognitive effort in children."

lived host protection from reinfection. Harnessing the functionality and longevity of memory T cells is the basis
for some vaccines and has become an attractive approach in cancer immunotherapy. However, the memory T
cell pool is heterogeneous, and it is currently unclear which subsets confer optimal protection during malignancy
or infection and how these subsets are transcriptionally programmed. We propose to define the transcriptional
and chromatin regulatory factors of memory T cell subset differentiation following infection and identify those that
promote accumulation and function of anti-tumor cytotoxic lymphocytes. Further, we will explore the relationship
between changes in chromatin configuration and memory T cell-specific transcriptional programs. We propose
highly collaborative Aims which leverage the expertise, infrastructure and technologies unique to the Crotty-
Pipkin-Goldrath laboratories and Cores. Specifically, we will: (1) Resolve the functional heterogeneity and
transcriptional programming of circulating CD8 memory T cell populations. (2) Define the transcriptional and
epigenetic programming of stem-like memory, effector, and tissue-resident CD8 T cell subsets in tumors. (3)
Resolve the roles of Blimp1 and Bcl6 in programming distinct CD4 memory T cell populations. (4) Dissect the
mechanism(s) by which the chromatin regulatory factor CTCF instructs memory T cell differentiation. By
developing an understanding of the factors that control differentiation and function of memory T cell subsets, it
may be possible to induce or regulate their activity in the context of infection, malignancy, and immunopathology."

The Data Management and Statistical Core (DMS) formalizes central data management and biostatistical
resources and functions for the Columbia Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC). The DMS will
continue to manage and expand a large, highly-structured relational database containing extensive clinical,
demographic and neuropathological information as well as key imaging and biospecimen indicators, including

10885050,"NEUROPATHOLOGY CORE PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The importance of human brain tissue in ADRD research cannot be overstated, both as a resource to explore
and define novel molecular pathways, as well as a critical resource for animal researchers who wish to validate
their findings in human tissue. The AMP-AD initiative recently launched by NIA is further validation of the
importance of human brain tissue in defining disease-relevant pathways, and has resulted in numerous
publications that have added to our evolving understanding of AD pathogenesis. The Columbia University ADRC
Neuropathology (NP) Core has a long history of serving the wider ADRD research community’s need for well
characterized human brain tissue, and we will continue this mission under this new P30 application. The chief
function of the NP Core is to provide state-of-the-art diagnostic services, and to collect, maintain, and distribute
optimally prepared brain samples to researchers at Columbia and throughout the world. The NP Core also has
a responsibility to train and educate the next generation of neurodegenerative disease researchers and brain
bankers. Finally, the NP Core will contribute to the investigation of the three pathways that are the scientific focus
of this application.
With regards to tissue banking and distribution, the NP Core has a well-established procedure for receiving and
banking brains, and we will continue this protocol for this new P30 application. Upon death of a donor, one half
brain is immersed in formalin and kept for thorough neuropathological evaluation, and the contralateral half is
extensively dissected at the fresh state and processed to yield up to 150 blocks and pulverized aliquots of
parenchyma. Our samples are barcoded and electronically tracked, which aids in organizing the samples,
maintaining them safely, and ultimately speeds the selection of samples for research. With regards to education,
the NP Core has a long-standing tradition of educating the next generation of neuroscientists and brain bankers,
through weekly brain cutting, monthly clinicopathological conferences, and periodic hosting of visiting
neuroscientists throughout the world (since 2001, our methodology has been fully or partially instituted at eight
other academic sites). Finally, we will use the resources of the NP core to inform on the three AD-associated
biological pathways. Specifically, we will use single-nucleus RNA-seq to ask the following questions: 1) What
cell types express the three established genes that relate to the three pathways (i.e. TREM2, APOE, SORL1)?;
2) Is there regional variation in the cell types that express these three genes?, and 3) Does this expression
pattern change during successive Braak stages?"
10885052,"OUTREACH RECRUITMENT & ENGAGEMENT CORE (ORE) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The ORE plays an essential role in achieving the proposed goals of the Columbia ADRC by meeting the
outreach, engagement, recruitment and retention needs of the ADRC, focused especially on our local Northern
Manhattan community. In the previous cycles of the Columbia ADRC, the ORE Core has successfully met
recruitment, outreach, and engagement goals, including the recruitment of ADRC participants from traditionally
underserved and understudied populations that reflects the diverse population of Northern Manhattan. In the
current application, the Columbia ADRC will focus on investigating Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-associated
biological pathways. Accordingly, we will prioritize the collection of biomarker data in the ADRC including
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and MRIs, posing new challenges for the ORE Core. To help meet these challenges,
and to continue to meet the outreach, recruitment, and engagement needs of our local Northern Manhattan,
larger New York, and national communities, we propose five initiatives: 1. Leveraging existing Columbia
recruitment resources. Columbia has several NIH-funded aging and dementia research and clinical programs
that we will collaborate with that have developed extensive recruitment programs; 2. Increasing community
outreach, including a new relationship with the largest Heathcare Workers Union in New York, and the
development of a new Community Advisory Board to assist us with planning and executing community
outreach; 3. Improving metrics and data management. In conjunction with the Data Management Core, we
propose to utilize a new registry of potential participants, including information that will allow us to determine
the relative recruitment success of different outreach activities; 4. Exploration of the ethical and logistic aspects
of return of biomarker results to research participants in conjunction with the Biomarker and Clinical Cores and
the Columbia Center for Research on Ethical, Legal & Social Implications of Psychiatric, Neurologic &
Behavioral Genetics; and 5. Increasing community education by expanding our English and Spanish
educational materials, especially materials on the risks, benefits, and information gained, by CSF, MRI, and
PET biomarkers. We are confident that the Columbia ADRC ORE Core can continue to meet the evolving
needs of the Columbia ADRC, including the continued involvement, engagement, and recruitment of
participants from traditionally underserved and understudied populations, and the outreach and engagement
needs of Northern Manhattan, the larger New York area, and the larger scientific community investigating

10885054,"BIOMARKER CORE PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The ability to study Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related disorders has been revolutionized by the development
and application of in vivo biomarkers. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), positron emission tomography
(PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow operational measurement of amyloid, tau, and
neurodegeneration (A/T/N), the major pathophysiological changes that define AD. Moreover, improved
sensitivity and specificity of instrumentation applied to biofluid data, of neuroimaging protocols, and of analytic
approaches both enable and necessitate the development, refinement, and discovery of novel biomarkers in any
comprehensive AD research program. The Columbia University ADRC Biomarker Core embraces these theme
and will derive standard biofluid and MRI biomarkers for all ADRC participants; serve as a central hub for human
biofluid, PET, and MRI-based biomarker research conducted within the cognitive aging and dementia community
at Columbia University; develop and implement novel biomarkers; and provide training opportunities for
investigators interested in incorporating AD-related biomarkers into their research.
The Biomarker Core leverages unique data sources, infrastructural, and intellectual strengths already in place
and comprises a team of close-collaborating investigators instrumental to the majority of ongoing AD biomarker
studies at Columbia University. The Biomarker Core will analyze research grade MRI scans acquired from
harmonized clinical scans, from ongoing studies, or de novo for neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular
markers. The Core features a newly-acquired single molecule array (Simoa) Benchtop Multiplexed Biomarker
Detection Analyzer and Mesoscale Discovery (MSD) platform for analysis of CSF and blood and development
of novel biomarkers. These resources will be used to derive existing blood- and CSF-based biomarkers and to
develop novel ones. The deep biomarker characterization of all ADRC participants and close interaction with
the other Cores will increase understanding of disease etiology and heterogeneity. The Biomarker Core has the
following aims: 1) To harmonize, bank, and disseminate fluid and neuroimaging biomarker data derived from
participants enrolled by the Clinical Core; 2) To quantitate biofluid biomarkers and MRI markers of
neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease, according to the A/T/N classification scheme; 3) To develop,
optimize, and implement biomarkers of the three thematic biological pathways: immune response, cholesterol
metabolism, and endosomal trafficking; 4) To provide intellectual, analytic, and infrastructural support to local
investigators interested in incorporating blood-based, CSF, MRI, and PET imaging biomarkers into their
Alzheimer’s-related research programs; and 5) To provide training and training opportunities for the next
generation of diverse scientists interested in incorporating biomarkers into the study of cognitive aging and
dementia."
10885056,"GENETICS CORE PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This new application will build on our work of the two previous funding cycles in which we established the Human
Genetics Core (HGC) as an essential part of the Columbia ADRC. The HGC provides a centralized resource for
the organization and analysis of genetic data within the ADRC and projects affiliated with the ADRC at Columbia
University by providing the full physical and intellectual infrastructure needed to coordinate genetic research
efforts and provide a platform for investigators to create a better understanding of genotype-phenotype

Specifically, the HGC will: (1) provide a genetic material repository to process, extract, store and distribute
genetic material from patients and controls, and track the collection and usage of genetic material; (2) provide
a genetic database for storage, handling, preparation and distribution of genomic data from ADRC subjects
and large-scale datasets available to the ADRC; (3) provide a high-end cluster environment and analytical
support in statistical genetics and bioinformatics to facilitate genomic data analysis; (4) provide genetic
counseling to patients and their families participating in the ADRC and ADRC affiliated studies; and (5) extend
the large-scale genomic data available on this ADRC sample (ie. GWAS, WGS/WES, eQTL maps), and
comprehensively characterize subjects for genetic variation in the amyloid, tau, immune response, cholesterol
and endosomal trafficking pathways. In line with our vision for precision medicine, this characterization will move
us forward to i) provide investigators with a backbone for more targeted research informed by genetic
background, ii) disentangle potential pathophysiologic heterogeneity in this cohort, and iii) explore a variety of
critical questions addressing the Thematic Aim by integration with the extensive translational data generated by
the Neuropathology, Biomarker and Neuroimmunology Cores."
10885982,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) Catalog’s mission is to provide a comprehensive and
complete resource of GWAS knowledge and to integrate the Catalog with appropriate resources, including
those that translate GWAS knowledge to improve human health and improve our understanding of human
variation in the context of complex disease and related traits. Over the next five years we will continue to
provide the most complete, curated, standardised and FAIR resource of GWAS data for an international user
community of biomedical researchers from academic and pharmaceutical companies. We will extend our
resource activities to closely link the GWAS Catalog with a major cognate application, that of Polygenic
Scores (PGS) and the Polygenic Score Catalog. We will continue to work with journals, consortia, charities
and other funders to ensure that data is accessible, federating elements of the data where it cannot be shared
due to ethical constraints. We will improve the data ingest, curation, visualisation and API components to
ensure we scale to increasing data and user volumes. Automation of curation, user deposition and literature
extraction will be automated and enhanced resulting in quality controlled, harmonised and FAIR knowledge
for users. By integrating data flows with PGS and Mendelian Randomisation (MR) resources, we will make
the data and necessary meta data readily accessible for analysis for a wider group of users and reduce
redundancy in data flow and acquisition across resources, consolidating our resource as the world’s primary
GWAS knowledge base. In Aim 1, we will deliver novel processes and support QC for author deposition of
significant SNP-Trait associations enabling scaling and leveraging existing author relationships. Our work to
acquire the community’s invaluable GWAS summary statistics will continue, with a target of 75% of all studies
linked to summary statistics, emphasising non-European ancestries and under-represented disease areas.
Aim 2 provides improvements for community uses of summary statistics by integrating data flows with PGS
and Mendelian Randomisation (MR) resources. Aim 3 addresses performance improvements for the
infrastructure ensuring it is portable and modular and enabling sharing of QC and harmonisation processes.
Aim 4 improves our graphical user interfaces, visualisation and data exploration tools and APIs, ensuring
they scale for unprecedented data volumes and are appropriate for evolving user needs. Together these
aims will serve our growing user community to both enable and enhance the aetiological understanding,
prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancers, psychiatric disorders and other
complex diseases."
10886010,"Project Summary: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia, and it is a major risk factor for
ischemic stroke and provokes morbidity and mortality along with a significant economic burden. Although AF has
been studied in various animals, the embryonic zebrafish has been the genetically tractable and optically
transparent model to investigate electromechanical coupling during cardiac development. Like in humans, the
action potential and the consequent myocardial contraction are also key indicators of cardiac function in the
zebrafish. By virtual of its transparency, optical mapping has been a primary means to investigate the interplay
between cardiac action potential and myocardial contraction to study the mechanisms of AF.
Dysregulation of electrical and mechanical coupling is a significant factor underlying the pathogenesis and
perpetuation of AF. Optical mapping of electromechanical decoupling in zebrafish is nontrivial because it requires
simultaneous recording of fast propagating voltage waves and myocardial contraction. Particularly in a beating
heart, the rapid myocardial contraction can easily blur the image—the motion artifacts superimpose the wave
patterns appearing in the optical maps and can prohibit further analysis of the imaging data. Pharmacological
uncoupling has been widely used to suppress heart motion. However, this makes studying electromechanical
coupling impossible. Alternatively, post-acquisition synchronization approach records a z-stack of movies, each
covering at least one cardiac cycle. After the recording is completed, one 3D cardiac cycle can be reconstructed
by synchronizing the movies in time. Nonetheless, this method is inapplicable to nonperiodic movements, such
as irregular heartbeats with AF. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop innovative optical techniques for
high-speed 3D mapping of electromechanical coupling in a rapidly and irregularly beating AF heart.
To solve this problem, we propose to develop a light-sheet light-field tomography (light-sheet LIFT) technique
for kilohertz 3D imaging of electromechanical coupling in zebrafish hearts undergoing AF. Our method has only
recently become possible due to two emerging technologies, light-field tomography (LIFT) and light-sheet
microscopy, both of which we have extensive experience with. We will integrate LIFT with light-sheet microscopy
and enable high-resolution 3D imaging with an unprecedented volumetric frame rate. The resultant system, light-
sheet LIFT, will provide enough spatiotemporal resolution to fully depict the interplay between voltage waves,
myocardial contraction, and intracardiac blood flow in a pitx2c zebrafish arrhythmia model. We expect our
method will advance the understanding of AF's fundamental mechanism from the electrical activities at a single-
cell level."
10885983,"Project Summary
Tetraspanins are an ancient and exceptionally well-conserved family of four pass transmembrane proteins –
numbering 33 unique members in humans – that have essential but poorly understood functions in many different
cellular contexts. Among tetraspanin proteins, CD81 and the C8 subfamily stand out as particularly important in
human biology. CD81 is a binding partner of CD19 in the B cell co-receptor complex, a key regulator of B cell
receptor (BCR) signaling. Relatively little is known, however, about how the dynamic association of CD81 with
CD19 regulates its association with the B cell receptor and ability to induce a signaling response, critical
knowledge gaps that impede therapeutic efforts to modulate or target this pathway. The subset of tetraspanins
with eight extracellular cysteine residues (the “C8” tetraspanins) facilitate the maturation and function of the
transmembrane metalloprotease ADAM10, which has numerous important roles in physiology and disease. In
the immune system, ADAM10 promotes T cell proliferation and cytokine production as the primary sheddase of
the low-affinity IgE receptor CD23, and it cleaves Lag-3 in response to stimulation of the T cell receptor. ADAM10
also catalyzes ligand-dependent physiologic Notch cleavage, an essential step in Notch signal transduction, and
is the protease responsible for constitutive alpha secretase processing of the Alzheimer’s precursor protein APP,
resulting in production of a non-toxic product instead of the toxic A-beta (Aβ) fragment produced by beta-
secretase. The objective of this work is to provide a deep and comprehensive understanding of the molecular
basis for the function of CD81 and the C8 tetraspanins using structural, biochemical, and dynamic approaches,
building from our recent progress in visualizing the structure of CD81 in its free and CD19-bound states. To
achieve this goal, we plan to elucidate the dynamics of the CD19-CD81 co-receptor complex in response to B
cell activation, determine the molecular basis for recognition of ADAM10 by C8 tetraspanins, and uncover how
C8-tetraspanin binding to ADAM10 modulates substrate selection and proteolytic activity. Together, successful
completion of these aims will provide a deep understanding of how CD81 modulates signal transduction by the
B cell co-receptor, and how the C8 tetraspanins influence ADAM10 metalloprotease function. These findings will
inform future therapeutic efforts targeting these important biological processes."
10885984,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The AR may be the earliest known example of a lineage oncogene: a master regulator of cell survival and growth
to which neoplastic cells derived from prostate epithelium are addicted. Recognizing this unique feature,
concerted efforts have focused on developing therapeutics capable of suppressing AR signaling. Androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT) and AR pathway signaling inhibitors (ARSI) produce dramatic responses in the vast
majority of patients with metastatic PC (mPC). Unfortunately, these responses are not accompanied by cures,
with near universal development of treatment resistance. Studies from our group and others have determined
that an increasing fraction of mPCs resisting AR pathway inhibition lose AR activity and gain a spectrum of new
phenotypes, each of which exhibit an aggressive clinical course with limited treatment options. The processes
by which tumor cells switch lineages under treatment pressure is not well understood. Determining the
mechanisms that permit or drive this lineage plasticity may identify new treatment strategies.
This proposal is designed to address a major clinical problem whereby AR pathway inhibition promotes tumor
cell plasticity. We will test the hypothesis that targeting permissive epigenetic factors or lineage determinants
together with AR pathway inhibition will prevent lineage-redirection, prolong response rates overall, and cure a
subset of advanced prostate cancers.
AIM 1. Identify the key determinants and permissive factors that promote a lineage switch from conventional AR-
driven prostate cancer to new phenotypes following AR-directed treatment.
AIM 2. Determine if modulating factors that drive or permit lineage specification can prevent, delay, or reverse
resistance to AR pathway inhibition.
AIM 3. Determine if co-targeting characteristics of re-directed lineages that emerge in the context of lineage
switching will prolong responses to AR pathway inhibition.
In order for effective therapeutics to be developed that can adequately address this new class of malignancy,
the pathways permitting or driving lineage conversion must first be clearly defined; this project aims to elucidate
those underlying mechanisms."
10886011,"Project Summary
The study of chemical mixtures is a high priority as mixtures represent the real-life exposure scenarios that
impact health. Mixtures are methodologically similar to studying the exposome (i.e. the study of all health
relevant exposures) and research on new methods to measure and analyze higher order mixtures will inform
future exposomic research. We have developed a tooth-based exposure biomarker that measures prenatal
and childhood exposure to elements and organic environmental chemicals that reduces exposure
misclassification and can accurately estimate both dose and timing of exposure. In our first grant cycle we
established the biomarker for a mixture of Pb, Mn, Zn, As and Cd in predicting neurodevelopment. In this
renewal we will longitudinally assess additional metals and more than 100 organic environmental chemicals
over the prenatal and early childhood periods. These early life stages are comprised of critical windows of
susceptibility when individuals are particularly vulnerable to chemical exposures. Current knowledge on the
effects of fetal exposure to chemical mixtures is limited. In reality, humans are exposed to a large number of
organic and inorganic toxicants simultaneously, but most studies only focused on one chemical at a time, and
while we know that elements and organic pollutants can interact biochemically, there are a lack of
comprehensive data on organic-element interactions. In addition, our biomarker can uniquely identify critical
windows that define heightened susceptibility with greater precision than blood or urine-based biomarkers.
Prospective birth cohorts that collect biomarkers during pregnancy and follow offspring into childhood can
provide evidence to assess the impact of exposures during key developmental windows, but this approach can
miss critical windows if biological sampling is mistimed. We propose to overcome these limitations by applying
precise tooth matrix-based biomarkers of organic chemical and elemental exposures at specific life stages that
comprehensively assess the prenatal and early childhood periods. Our overarching aim is to study the risk of
neurodevelopmental deficits due to high dimensional mixtures of elements and organic chemicals using a
single toxicant exposure biomarker. We will leverage 3 established and richly characterized birth cohorts in a
discovery–replication design. Our discovery cohort (called PROGRESS) and our 2 replication cohorts (called
ELEMENT and PRISM) were all recruited during early pregnancy and followed through late childhood. Two are
based in Mexico City, have similar designs and have multiple overlapping neurodevelopmental test data. The
3rd is based in New York City and allows us to better generalize results to the U.S.; thus, we replicate at
multiple levels. Finally, in preparation for this highly innovative proposal, we have collected deciduous teeth for
biomarker analysis in all 3 cohorts (80% of teeth are already collected) and have extensive rigorously collected
longitudinal neurodevelopment data, making our proposal time efficient (i.e. covers over a decade of life in one
grant cycle) and cost-effective."
10886013,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fibrotic disorders account for a significant source of global morbidity and mortality. Idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, and life-threatening lung disease most prevalent in elderly populations.
IPF impacts 100,000 patients in the U.S. alone and there are approximately 34,000 new global diagnoses each
year. Most patients with IPF succumb to respiratory failure within 3-5 years and the only clinically available
therapeutic treatments do not cure the disease. As the average age of the U.S. population increases, it is
imperative for researchers and practitioners to work together to identify new targets to halt or reverse IPF.
Discovery of new therapeutic targets for IPF through traditional cell culture techniques and pre-clinical animal
models has several limitations because these systems do not adequately reproduce key aspects of human
physiology. Most importantly, dynamic cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions that are difficult to recapitulate in
vitro drive the progression of fibrosis: it is not clear, for example, whether changes in the extracellular matrix
(ECM) composition or the subsequent alterations in mechanical properties of the surrounding tissues are the
more potent drivers of IPF, i.e., the best target for therapeutics. New tools and technologies that enable us to
dynamically study the pathogenesis of fibrosis over time remain an unresolved challenge.
My laboratory has developed novel methods to synthesize and microfabricate a new class of biomaterials to
conduct dynamic cell-ECM studies, not currently possible in traditional models of fibrosis. Our innovative
platform combines a phototunable poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) backbone with clickable decellularized ECM
(dECM) from healthy or diseased lung tissue so that we may decouple fibrotic tissue composition (e.g.,
increased collagen content) from subsequent changes in mechanical properties (e.g., increased stiffness).
Specifically, healthy or IPF lung dECM will be incorporated into soft (1-5 kPa) hydrogel matrices that mimic
healthy tissue, then exposure to focused light will dynamically initiate stiffening to fibrotic levels (>10 kPa).
Three aims are proposed to engineer and implement this biomaterials-based strategy for building novel, high-
fidelity in vitro models of IPF. AIM I: Engineer the structure, composition, and dynamic mechanics of PEG-
dECM cell culture platforms to recapitulate distal lung tissue; AIM II: Interrogate the impact of composition and
mechanical properties on fibroblast activation using dynamic PEG-dECM biomaterial platforms; and AIM III:
Identify druggable mechanosensitive targets of the fibrotic activity recreated in dynamic 3D models. Successful
completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the cellular and molecular drivers of IPF, building
the foundation for high-throughput discovery and screening of therapeutics for precision medical treatments."

10886002,"Abstract
After the completion of the Human Genome Project, thousands of experiments from ENCODE and Roadmap
Epigenomics projects have successfully proﬁled regulatory elements and epigenetic landscape along the genome.
More recently, over 2,000 chromatin organization datasets have been generated from 4D Nucleome (4DN) Project,
and they provide complementary information about how these genomic and epigenomic elements are spatially
organized in a nucleus. Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization with previously proﬁled 1D epigenome in
different cell types will be a key step to understand the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation over
long genomic distances. However, there are two challenges. First, there is a resolution mismatch between
chromatin organization data (e.g. Hi-C contacts) which are usually measured at 10k base pair resolution, and
epigenome-based chromatin state features (e.g. ChIP-seq peaks) whose signals are usually at tens to hundreds of
base pairs. Second, existing computational approaches for analyzing epigenome, such as annotating genome and
understanding regulatory elements, all treat the DNA sequence as one-dimensional data, leaving the important
3D structural information unutilized. We aim to develop the most cutting-edge deep learning approaches for
understanding the relationship between chromatin state features and chromatin organization, performing 3D and 4D
genome annotation, and identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors, respectively. After the completion of
the proposed work, we expect to have: (1) an accurate and interpretable computational model to predict chromatin
contact maps at nucleosome resolution for a wide range of cell lines, (2) 3D and 4D genome annotations over
dynamic chromatin organization, regulatory elements and epigenomic features, and (3) a computational method for
identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors which can help us understand the orchestration of noncoding
genetic variants. These results will provide fundamental understanding of disease-relevant genetic variation in the
light of the spatial organization of these genomic and epigenomic elements and their functional implications."
10886003,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective at reducing the acquisition of HIV; however, achieving the full
impact of this intervention is contingent on maintaining engagement in care throughout periods of high and low
risk. Currently, in the United States, only 270,000 out of 1.2 million individuals with indications for PrEP receive
it. Additionally, even for those who start PrEP, adherence, and persistence in comprehensive HIV prevention
care is poor, characterized by multiple discontinuations and restarts. Furthermore, HIV risk changes over time
and individual-level reasons for engagement, very early disengagement (<2 visits after initiation), early
disengagement (2-4 visits after initiation), and late disengagement (>4 visits after initiation) are not well
described; social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) like insurance, housing status, substance use,
and mental health, are increasingly recognized as key factors. As PrEP programs expand to meet the
projected need, the cost of providing support services will be substantial and thus identifying patients at highest
risk of loss-to-follow-up and selecting optimal services to support persistence in care and PrEP adherence is
essential. Furthermore, many individuals receiving HIV prevention services are known to receive highly
fragmented care typified by multiple providers and institutions, thereby creating a challenge to accurately
characterize persistence in care. Guided by the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model, we
propose to address this critical area of research by focusing on factors that are associated with very early,
early, and late disengagement from HIV prevention care. We will identify baseline factors through a
comprehensive questionnaire conducted at the time of enrollment into comprehensive HIV prevention care. We
will layer onto that longitudinal factors, such as social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH), which
can vary over time, to get a more comprehensive and precise picture of factors affecting persistence in
prevention care. To address the issue of fragmented care and better characterize persistence in care, we will
utilize information contained in a large Health Information Exchange (HIE), Healthix, to capture all health care
visits in New York. We propose to use machine-learning methods to design predictive models of
disengagement from HIV prevention care. This comprehensive assessment of persistence in HIV prevention
care will inform the development of high quality, scalable models of HIV prevention care, making it possible to
target limited resources towards individuals at the highest risk of disengagement."

 The human intestinal tract supports a complex microbial environment consisting of bacterial (or
microbiota) and fungal (or mycobiota) constituents. Although the role of each of these communities has been a
subject of multiple studies, the role of transkingdom interactions between fungi and bacteria in shaping host
immunity and physiology has been much less explored. The chemical basis for such interactions, critical for the
rational design of mechanistic studies with regards to host immunity and disease development, remain
completely uncharted territory in the literature. We have established a genetic manipulation pipeline to identify
gene transfer methodology and build a genetic tool for nonmodel human gut bacteria on a large scale. Via a
multifactorial optimization of their conjugation/transformation conditions and targeting bacterial conserved 16s
rRNA genes, this pipeline efficiently identified the gene transfer methods for multiple nonmodel gut bacterial
commensals and set up CRISPR-based or gene insertion tools in multiple of them. This library of genetically
targetable microbes comes from 5 different phyla. This genetic manipulation pipeline and this library of tractable
commensals will facilitate our investigation of trans-kingdom microbiota-mycobiota interactions at the molecular
level. A high throughput screening of bacterial metabolite libraries from gut bacteria identified metabolites with
direct effect on intestinal mycobiota. We identified bacterial species and corresponding gene clusters responsible
for the production of these metabolites. Our preliminary data suggest strong ties and specific molecular
interactions between fungi and bacteria in the gut that have previously unappreciated role in microbial dynamics,
metabolite production and immunity. We will utilize such bacterial strains and isogenic mutants in key
biosynthetic pathways to target metabolites with mycobiota modulatory properties. We will use several mouse
models and synthetic microbial communities to define the role of trans kingdom interaction between bacteria and
fungi in modulating host immunity and colonization resistance in the gut. We hypothesize that metabolites from
the human bacterial microbiota modulate the fungal communities in the gut to affect microbial composition, the
microbiome function and immunity. In addition to revealing novel mechanisms of fungal-bacterial interaction at
an unprecedented small molecule level, the results of this proposed investigation will illuminate potential new
strategies for targeting of fungal pathogens"

US national strategy to end the epidemic. Multiple individual, interpersonal, and structural vulnerabilities fuel the
HIV epidemic among TW, as well as fuel syndemic conditions (co-occurring and reinforcing diseases or other
health conditions, such as HIV, substance use, and mental health disorder, that are often a consequence of
social inequity). National cohorts are critical to monitoring epidemic trends and how major events (e.g.,
epidemics, policy change, new biomedical interventions) impact HIV and other health conditions; this is
particularly important for TW who are often excluded from national surveillance efforts. The objective of this
proposal is to use a novel, hybrid “community hub”-supported digital cohort (“hub-supported digital cohort”)
model to evaluate HIV incidence, risk factors, and syndemic conditions among TW in the US (N=3,000). In this
model, on-the-ground community “hubs” will support enrollment and retention of a racially/ethnically and
culturally diverse, nationwide digital cohort. We will refine optimal digital cohort methods while examining the
impact of structural and psychosocial syndemic experiences on HIV incidence and parameterizing mathematical
models to identify targets for future multi-level combination HIV prevention interventions. The specific aims are:
1) Determine the efficiency and acceptability of using a novel, hub-supported digital cohort model to enroll and
retain a sample of racially/ethnically diverse TW for HIV research. 2) Estimate the prevalence and characterize
patterns of syndemic experiences among TW. 3) Estimate HIV incidence in TW, followed every 6 months for at
least 24 months to identify tailored approaches for combination, multi-disciplinary HIV prevention interventions.
3.1) Examine the effect of syndemic experiences and contextual structural factors on HIV incidence among TW
in the US. 3.2) Characterize the PrEP continuum among TW and associations with HIV incidence over time,
including uptake of newly emerging formulations, longitudinal patterns of HIV risk and adherence, and the role
of syndemic classes and contextual factors in the PrEP continuum PrEP uptake, adherence, and retention. 4.)
Develop dynamic models of multi-level combination HIV prevention interventions and scale-up among TW to
simulate the impact of evaluated interventions on HIV incidence through 2030, corresponding to the National
HIV strategy. There is a need to refine and evaluate hybrid digital cohort models with attention to mitigating
selection bias and attrition of vulnerable populations – an area of research particularly important for an epidemic
underscored by social and health disparities. Our explicit efforts to develop a hybrid cohort model center on
equity to support research participation across diverse populations and provide representative and generalizable
data. Study findings will provide critical epidemiologic parameters for future HIV prevention research, provide a
platform for exploration of other research questions, and inform the development of evidence-based and
acceptable HIV interventions to reduce HIV acquisition among transgender women in the US."
10884098,"One in 10 Americans aged 65 and older (10%) has Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with prevalence increasing with
age. AD is a slowly progressive, irreversible neurodegenerative disease with a long preclinical phase. The
pathophysiology of AD is not fully understood but is likely to be multifactorial. One postulated contributor is
impaired glymphatic clearance. The glymphatic system is conceptualized as a system by which soluble proteins
and metabolites are eliminated from the central nervous system via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid
(ISF) exchange in the perivascular space (PVS). In rodent models, sleep and physical activity have been reported
to accelerate glymphatic clearance using invasive methods. During sleep, a nearly 60% increase in clearance of
brain waste was observed in rats, caused by expansion and contraction of the extracellular space. Glymphatic
clearance was transiently increased in aged mice by physical activity, and physical activity has been reported to
improve clearance of brain Aβ in rats. Although animal studies suggest that reduced glymphatic clearance is
important for cognitive function in aging, translation of findings from rodents to humans is limited because rodent
models do not fully capture the human experience. In humans, use of a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)
via intrathecal injection allows for observation of glymphatic clearance, albeit over a long period. However, this
method is limited by its invasiveness, and by the unknown effect of the GBCA tracer on the in vivo time-course
of glymphatic clearance. Using a novel, noninvasive, non-contrast 3D MRI technique, we have shown intrinsic
glymphatic clearance or CSF outflow metrics decreases with age using a single-tagged method. The intrinsic
CSF metrics decrease drastically over 60 years old. Thus, we will develop an advanced double-tagged method
from both brain hemispheres. Using the double-tagged method, we propose to study healthy older adults, mild
cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD patients on intrinsic CSF outflow metrics by segmenting various regions of
interest (ROI) such as upper, middle, and lower parasagittal dura (PSD), superior sagittal sinus (SSS), and entire
SSS region. Because CSF outflow is influenced by physical activity, we will monitor their activity level using
actigraphy. Our challenges include segmentation of these small ROIs, and measurement of subtle changes in
CSF outflow metrics in each ROI. To overcome these challenges, our aims of the project are i) identify the
detailed CSF outflow egress pathways; ii) obtain quantitative measures at each ROI from both sides of brain
hemispheres; iii) compare quantitative measures of intrinsic CSF outflow in MCI and AD patients to age-, and
sex-matched cognitively healthy adults; iv) investigate any preference of intrinsic CSF outflow metrics from the
right- and left-brain hemispheres; and compare with their physical activity level. We expect that intrinsic CSF
outflow will decrease with cognitive decline; that clearance pathways may be altered in MCI and AD patients
from healthy individuals."
10886034,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
This competing renewal to Suubi+Adherence study (R01HD074949) will examine the longitudinal HIV
antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and related outcomes, and the potential mechanisms of protective health
behaviors among youth living with HIV (YLHIV) who participated in an evidence-based family economic
empowerment (FEE) intervention in Uganda and are now transitioning into young adulthood. Sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA) has the highest HIV prevalence rate in the world. In Uganda, a poor SSA country hardest hit with HIV, the
prevalence of viral load suppression among adolescents and young adults (15 to 24 years old) is 44.9% for
females and 32.5% for males. For six years (2012-2018), the Suubi+Adherence study prospectively followed
702 YLHIV (aged 10 to 16 years at enrollment) randomized to two study arms across 39 clinics in Uganda: 1)
control arm consisting of bolstered standard of care (BSOC) and 2) intervention arm consisting of BSOC and a
FEE intervention. Study findings pointed to superior short-term viral suppression and positive child health and
mental health functioning among the intervention arm. This renewal (Suubi+Adherence-Round 2) proposes to
examine whether the results are maintained through young adulthood, an incredibly vulnerable transition period,
particularly in areas of adherence to HIV treatment, cognitive development, mental health, sexual risk taking
behaviors and alcohol/drug misuse. The renewal (2020-2025) will build on the Suubi+Adherence study to
conduct one of the largest and longest running studies of YLHIV in SSA during a developmental period marked
by profound biological and psychological maturation, and development transitional milestones. In this next
phase, we will add a qualitative component to examine participants' experiences with the FEE program as well
as long-term effects. Innovatively, we will also assess the impact of the FEE on cognitive functioning. The study
specific aims are: Aim 1. To examine the long-term impact of the Suubi+Adherence intervention on: HIV viral
suppression (primary outcome) and to explore the long-term impact of the intervention on key HIV treatment
adherence outcomes for YLHIV, including participants' ability to access and refill prescribed medication, adhere
to prescribed daily medication routines, and engage in HIV care; Aim 2. To elucidate the long-term effects of the
Suubi+Adherence intervention on potential mechanisms of change, including: a) economic stability, sexual risk-
taking behavior, adherence self-efficacy; b) cognitive functioning; c) mental health functioning; and d) young
adult transitions and social support; Aim 3. To qualitatively examine– prospectively and retrospectively: a) multi-
level factors affecting participants' maintenance of intervention benefits since Suubi+Adherence intervention
initiation (prospectively); and b) participants' experiences with the intervention (retrospectively), including multi-
level factors that may have influenced their engagement with the program and their decision-making in regard
to ART adherence; Aim 4. To examine the long-term cost-effectiveness of the Suubi+Adherence intervention.
The study is aligned with the National Institutes of Health Office of AIDS Research priorities."
10882957,"Project Summary
The long-term objective of this application is to understand the molecular pathways of myocardial infraction (MI)-
mediated cardiac fibrosis and eventually heart failure. In our last grant cycle, we elucidated thoroughly the role
of Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a multi-ligand receptor/adaptor and mediator of different signaling pathways including
TGFβ, in MI-induced cardiac pathogenesis, in particular fibrosis, and inflammation. Our preliminary data suggest
that conditional knockdown of NRP1 in the adult mice, either in cardiomyocytes (CM) or in endothelial cells (EC)
resulted varied phenotypes following cardiac injury (MI). In addition, our preliminary data from the single-nucleus
RNA sequencing (snRNA seq) using the cardiac tissues in a cell-specific manner and revealed marked changes
in gene expression patterns of key genes previously known to be associated with inflammation, cardiac
hypertrophy, fibrosis. In addition, we revealed microRNA (miR30s) showed differentially expressed in ECNRP1-/-
vs. CMNRP1-/- cells that correlated with HF genes. Hence, the scientific premise of this proposal is to reveal the
mechanistic role of divergent NRP1 spatiotemporal signaling in MI pathogenesis, and eventually to develop new
therapeutic targets and strategies to overcome progressive cardiac dysfunctions and overall heart failure. In this
regard, we will examine the spatiotemporal influence of NRP1 pathways for cardiac fibrosis following MI injury
as well as define the tissue-specific role of microRNAs regulated by NRP1 pathways on MI-induced fibrosis.
Finally, we will develop new therapeutic approaches to overcome cardio fibrosis following MI injury combining
novel NRP1 inhibitor (NRP1i) using novel targeted liposomal formulations. The current application is a multi-
disciplinary approach to reveal the spatiotemporal role of NRP1 in cardiac fibrosis/remodeling and identify new
targets to develop novel therapies to overcome one of the most common myocardial pathologies, which is an
unmet clinical need."
10883049,"Project Summary: While elevations of circulating pro-inflammatory modulators correlate directly with variables
of aggression, and direct application of cytokines to specific cortico-limbic regions in animals elicit aggressive
responding, no studies have tested the hypothesis that acute increases in pro-inflammatory modulators can/will
increase aggressive behavior in humans. We aim to demonstrate a causal relationship between pro-
inflammatory cytokines and aggression in human subjects by showing that an acute pro-inflammatory state, via
endotoxin challenge, will increase aggressive responding, anger ratings, and hostile social cognition, to a greater
degree in “aggressive” (n = 45), compared with “non-aggressive” (n = 45), individuals with mood/anxiety/ stress-
related and/or personality disorders. The proposed study is a double-blind comparison of endotoxin/placebo
challenge in the same individuals (within-subject) as a function of aggression status. Aggressive individuals will
have high lifetime aggression (> 12 on Life History of Aggression: LHA) and be positive for an average of two
anger attacks per week and/or three anger attacks per year that include physical assault of another person
and/or or non-trivial destruction of property. “Non-Aggressive” individuals will be similar diagnostically but will
have low lifetime aggression. “Aggressive responding” will be assessed using the Taylor Aggression Paradigm
(TAP), “Anger” will be assessed by self-reported assessments (POMS), and “Hostile Social Cognition” will be
assessed by the Video-SEIP (V-SEIP) paradigm. The primary plasma pro-inflammatory outcome measures will
be a composite of CRP, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α (as in our previous studies). MRI scans will including task-based
scans involving “explicit” and “ambiguous” social threat. We hypothesize that aggressive responding, anger
ratings, and hostile social cognition (Primary Outcomes) and Composite Plasma Pro-Inflammatory Marker levels
(Secondary Outcome), will be greater after endotoxin, compared with placebo, and will be greater in “aggressive”
than “non-aggressive” study participants. We also hypothesize that these variables will correlate with
dimensional measures of aggression. In addition, we hypothesize that amygdala responses to explicit social
threat (anger faces) will be enhanced (greater BOLD fMRI signal response) after Endotoxin, and that cortico-
limbic responses to ambiguous social threat (V-SEIP) will be reduced (i.e., lesser BOLD fMRI signal response)
in all study participants but reduced to a greater extent in “aggressive”, compared with “non-aggressive”, study
participants. Finally, we hypothesize that the pro-inflammatory effects of the endotoxin challenge will result in
reduced connectivity between the functional edges supporting higher aggressive behavior and that endotoxin
challenge will facilitate stronger connections among nodes associated with low aggressive behavior. If
supported, this study will provide a strong rationale for clinical trials of anti-inflammatory agents in impulsive
aggressive individuals."
10883105,"The goal of this proposal is to develop and integrate a high spatial/spectral resolution reproducible whole-brain
magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) framework on 3T scanners to improve our understanding
of metabolic changes that occur in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. While MRSI has been shown to
provide great utility to study metabolic changes associated with neurodegenerative disorders, its widespread
adaption as a clinical tool has not been realized due to several technical challenges, such as low sensitivity,
low spatial resolution (often just single voxel), B0 field inhomogeneity, and lack of complete integration with the
scanner. The goal of this study is to develop novel methods of acquiring, processing, quantifying, and
analyzing MR spectral data that overcome these technical challenges. This work will be undertaken by a
collaborative team of investigators from the University of Iowa, University of California San Francisco, and GE
Healthcare.
To achieve our goals, we are proposing the following specific aims: 1) Develop and validate a high-resolution
5D MRSI framework on 3T scanners; 2) Develop tools for quantitative regional assessment of MRSI data; and
3) Evaluate the reliability and utility of the MRSI tools in a cohort of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), early
Alzheimer’s disease, and a matched control sample without memory issues. Aims 1 and 2 will generate a
normative metabolic atlas for ages 40-80 years old, which is composed of equal representation by gender. The
resulting tools will also be applied to Aim 3 to evaluate brain metabolic profiles in MCI and early Alzheimer’s
disease as compared to the matched control sample. The successful completion of this proposal will result in a
whole brain MRSI protocol capable of collecting high quality data in less than 20 minutes, which can be used to
study metabolic changes associated with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. The tools developed
here will be distributed through the GE collaboration portal where they will be shared as a work in progress
(WIP) package where feedback from the broader user community will be gathered to further refine the tools. In
addition, the tools will also be distributed in an open format allowing them to be readily ported to MR scanners
from other vendors. Ultimately, the tools will provide the ability to identify metabolic changes that occur in the
brain associated with neurodegenerative disorders, which could be used to identify potential targets for new
therapeutic agents as well as a marker for response to such therapies."

Cognitive decline in the spectrum of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) including Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and
Parkinson’s disease with dementia (PDD) takes a severe toll on patients, family, and society in suffering and
cost. The memory and cognitive deficits observed in AD, DLB and PDD are attributable in large part to a loss of
cholinergic function and neurons in the brain, especially but not limited to cells in the nucleus basalis of Meynert
(NBM). The greatest unmet need for AD, DLB and PDD are therapies that can go beyond symptom treatment to
possibly stabilize or maintain cholinergic circuits. As part of clinical trials, we have been delivering mixed-cell,
pro-regenerative peripheral nerve tissue (PNT) to areas of the brain affected in neurodegenerative disease. Here
we propose a Phase I single surgical-center, double-blinded clinical trial involving bilateral autologous PNT into
the NBM to address “repair cell” support of cholinergic neurons. The major goal of this trial is to identify the
feasibility and safety of bilateral implantation of reparative PNT to the NBM with the eventual goal to improve
function of cholinergic neurons in dementias. Twenty-four participants, diagnosed with PD and who have
selected, qualified, and agreed to undergo DBS surgery of the globus pallidus internus (GPi), will be followed for
24 months as part of a trial to receive, at the time of DBS surgery, PNT implanted bilaterally into the NBM (twelve
participants) or an alternate target also affecting cognition in this population, the substantia nigra (SN). DBS will
be implanted and programmed to provide the standard of care. Feasibility objectives will be based on the number
of participants receiving PNT delivery and the number of participants completing the 12- month and 24-month
study visits. For the safety objective, the number of serious adverse events related to the procedure will be
collected for 24 months following surgery. Cognitive safety endpoints at 12 and 24-months following surgery will
be defined as ≥ 1.5 standard deviation decrement relative to the participant’s estimated pre-morbid functioning.
To aid in future trial designs, secondary outcome analyses will use neuropsychological testing of subjects (at 12
and 24-months after surgery compared to baseline) and Movement Disorder Society – Unified Parkinson’s
Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) evaluations and quality of life assessments at 6, 12 and 24-months after
surgery compared to baseline. We will continue to expand our brain bank activities in conjunction with the
University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to assess the histological effects of the investigational cell
therapy in participants who have donated their brain after death and to better characterize the disease process
in our study subjects. This study is a critical step for identifying the feasibility of this NBM vs. SN design for trialing
in subsequent multicenter, Phase II studies and for continuing to move this approach forward as an eventual
monotherapy for the treatment of the Spectrum of AD."
10883207,"The ability to diagnose and classify leukemias and lymphomas (LLs), in children and young adults is
limited in Kenya and most of Sub-Saharan Africa. LLs represent nearly half the cancers in this population. Flow
cytometry (FC) offers a major advantage in leukemia diagnosis. The only center that has implemented flow
cytometry in western Kenya to diagnose LLs is based in the AMPATH reference laboratory (ARL). A major gap
in cancer care in Kenya is the lack of cost-effective screening tests for leukemia and lymphoma. The only
option for patients with suspected LLs is to travel to the ARL in Eldoret and pay out of pocket for expensive
diagnostic services, including FC. The current FC workflow in the ARL uses a four-tube, ten-color fluorescent
antibody testing in which four separate assays are needed per patient. We hypothesize that we can convert
our current four-tube process on bone marrow, to a better process utilizing peripheral blood samples in a
single-tube FC screening assay, with additional testing for only a small minority of patients with evidence of
malignancy that cannot be resolved by our single tube assay. This low-cost test will increase accessibility, as a
blood sample can be transported to the lab instead of the patient traveling for a bone marrow procedure.
 Our aims for this proposal are to:
1: Validate and measure the concordance of three flow cytometry tests comparing bone marrow aspiration
and peripheral blood (PB) from patients in our hospital with suspected leukemia. We will measure the
concordance of our current gold standard, four-tube method for leukemia diagnosis on bone marrow samples
with a new, ten-color, single tube dry, unitized reagent assays (DURA) ClearLLab® LS single tube designed
for lymphoid and myeloid malignancy screening and diagnosis. Simultaneously, we will measure the
concordance of the LS single-tube assay on bone marrow with the same assay using peripheral blood to
demonstrate the equivalence of those two methods.
2: Establish and validate an adapted flow cytometry assay for leukemia diagnosis in distant, peripheral facilities
in Kenya. We will identify patients with suspected leukemia in our partner peripheral facilities and transport PB
samples to the ARL for analysis by flow cytometry and expand our reach for simplifying diagnosis without the
need for bone marrow sampling or transporting patients to the hospital first, thereby adding to the efficiency of
the process.
3: Develop a comprehensive educational model to ensure short- and long-term implementation of flow
cytometry in the region. With support from medical experts in the United States and Beckman-Coulter, ARL
staff will then implement a comprehensive training program featuring on-site training, continuous telehealth
education (Project ECHO), and an asynchronous learning management system (Kaluza, Cytobank) to ensure
continued effective utilization and sustainability of Flow Cytometry."
10882474,"ABSTRACT
The major life-saving treatment for severe acute liver injury (ALI) leading to acute liver failure (ALF) is a liver
transplant. However, there is an enduring shortage of healthy donor livers. Moreover, even when a suitable
liver can be obtained, transplant recipients face myriad life-threatening risks like graft rejection, infection, renal
failure, and vascular problems, leading to death in 10-20% within a year post-transplant. Clearly, better
treatments are needed. However, poor understanding of the mechanisms of regeneration specifically in ALI is
a major obstacle to achieving that goal. While prior work in tissue regeneration has focused on the roles of
proteins like growth factors and cytokines, our laboratory is interested in the underexplored effects of lipid
second messengers. In particular, our work has revealed that the glycerophospholipid phosphatidic acid (PA)
is a critical regeneration signal in the mouse model of acetaminophen (APAP) overdose, which is the most
common cause of ALF in the US. Our data show that PA mediates regeneration signaling by inhibiting
glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), which normally suppresses hepatocyte proliferation and therefore
tissue repair. Now, our objective in this R01 project is to improve understanding of the regeneration process by
determining exactly how PA regulates GSK3β. We hypothesize that PA accumulates specifically in lipid
membranes – especially in the endoplasmic reticulum – after ALI and coordinately recruits GSK3β and liver
kinase b 1 (LKB1) so that LKB1 phosphorylates GSK3β Ser9 and thereby inhibits GSK3β activity, which
removes the brakes on regeneration. We will test our hypothesis in two specific aims. Specific Aim 1: Detail
the temporal, zonal, and subcellular localization and physical interactions of PA and GSK3β. Our prior
work shows that PA deactivates GSK3β during regeneration after acetaminophen (APAP)-induced ALI. In
addition, our preliminary data indicate that GSK3β can directly bind to PA. Here, we will use mass
spectrometry imaging (MSI), triple quadrupole mass spectrometry, immunohistochemistry, and lipid-binding
tests to characterize the location and binding of PA and GSK3β in hepatocytes in vitro and after APAP
hepatotoxicity in mice. Specific Aim 2: Define the role of LKB1 in GSK3β phosphorylation and liver
regeneration in the mouse model of APAP-induced ALI. Our data show that LKB1 co-precipitates with
GSK3β. Furthermore, other groups have demonstrated that LKB1 binds to PA. Thus, it is highly plausible that
binding to PA brings LKB1 and GSK3β together. We will use similar methods from Specific Aim 1 to describe
the distribution of LKB1 during regeneration. We will then use genetic approaches to disrupt LKB1 signaling in
mice and explore the effect on both GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation and liver regeneration in APAP-induced ALI.
Finally, we will assess the relative contributions of PA signaling and conventional Wnt signaling for regulation
of β-catenin. Overall, the critical mechanistic insights produced in this project will be valuable to develop new
therapeutic approaches for ALF, as well as other high-priority diseases involving GSK3β."

Over 268,000 children entered foster care in the United States during fiscal year 2019 despite the existence of
evidence-based programs (EBPs) that can successfully prevent child maltreatment. Evidence-informed
decision-making (EIDM) can lead to the adoption of EBPs that are likely to be successfully implemented and
result in the intended impacts. Despite the existence of EBPs to prevent child maltreatment, EBPs are
underutilized in child welfare. Proposed study activities in this career development award respond to NIMH
Objective 4.2.c by developing, refining, and piloting an implementation strategy to increase EIDM when
decision makers are adopting EBPs to improve mental health and child welfare services. Activities leverage an
unprecedented federal policy opportunity to prevent child maltreatment and test implementation decision
support strategies in the real world: The Family First Prevention Services Act (FFPSA). FFPSA aims to prevent
child maltreatment and foster care entries by providing federal funding to states for implementing EBPs that
support child and parent mental health, reduce parental substance misuse, and improve parenting skills. This
project engages decision makers from four states implementing FFPSA to extend the candidate’s prior work
developing an innovative EIDM tool to support EBP adoption: Optimizing Responses through Collaborative
Assessments (ORCA). ORCA is based in multi-criteria decision analysis, which provides a structured approach
to reach quality, evidence-informed group decisions. Given that group decisions with tools such as ORCA
benefit from facilitation, this study will develop and test two facilitation modalities to accompany ORCA:
automated (ORCA-A) and live (ORCA-L). In addition, a web-based platform to host the ORCA tool and the
ORCA-A facilitation strategy will be developed with decision makers’ input (Aim 1). The impact of ORCA-A and
ORCA-L on quality of decision experiences, processes, and outcomes then will be tested (Aim 2).
Implementation process quality for each EBP adopted with ORCA-A and ORCA-L will be monitored (Aim 3). To
enhance her strong foundation in the implementation, decision, and systems sciences, the candidate, Dr.
Gracelyn Cruden, will leverage these research activities and training activities to expand her skillset to include:
leading implementation studies in service systems, employing a continuum of methods for engaging
community members, leveraging interdisciplinary approaches for eliciting members’ preferences, conducting
advanced simulation model testing, and using advanced statistics for multilevel, longitudinal studies. Cruden
will be mentored by an outstanding team led by Primary Mentor Dr. Lisa Saldana, who is accompanied by
Mentors Dr. Jason Chapman, Dr. Lindsey Zimmerman, Dr. R. Christopher Sheldrick, Dr. Jonathan Purtle, and
Consultants Dr. David Vanness, and Ms. Clare Anderson. Upon completion of these activities, Cruden will be
equipped to lead an interdisciplinary research team that will support quality mental health and child welfare
services by increasing decision makers’ use of EIDM."

The NIA Interventions Testing Program (ITP) is a multi-institutional study investigating interventions with the
potential to extend lifespan and delay disease or dysfunction in mice. Interventions are tested in parallel at three
sites (The Jackson Laboratory, University of Michigan, and University of Texas) using identical standardized
protocols. Such treatments include pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, foods, dietary supplements, plant extracts,
hormones, peptides, amino acids, chelators, redox agents, and other compounds or mixtures of compounds. We
propose to advance the Mouse Phenome Database (MPD) in response to emerging needs of the aging research
community, specifically the ITP, to continue being a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) that curates ITP data,
makes it available through a public database, and provides tools that enable users to visualize, analyze, and
download the primary and summary data from these studies. Our objectives are to provide a central repository
for data, documentation, and protocols, offering a unique and important venue for ITP investigators needing to
make their data public; to continually refine and develop tools and features to best locate, present, and analyze
those datasets; and to maintain, enhance, and promote this resource to further enable quantitative, standardized
and predictive phenotype studies and, in turn facilitate new scientific advances in the field of aging. We have
designed a publicly accessible website and data repository for the ITP. We have also curated and posted data
from numerous ITP studies. ITP plans for the next five years include additional lifespan trials, detailed analyses
of agents found to increase lifespan, and continued growth in data on health outcomes. To help support these
goals, our specific aims are to: 1) maintain information on experimental designs, protocols, and SOPs, 2) create,
maintain, and update a publicly accessible electronic inventory of samples in the Interventions Biospecimens
Repository (IBR), 3) coordinate data collection among the three ITP Centers and members of the research
community conducting focused, ancillary studies on specific interventions, 4) provide a statistical core for
independent analysis of data collected by ITP, 5) implement interactive and dynamic visualization tools for
statistical analyses and data reuse, and 6) maintain a public-access interactive website and machine accessible
data repository for ITP. Successful completion of our Aims will yield a widely useful and sustainable system for
public access to experimental details and analysis of ITP data. The resource will have a modern interactive
environment and expose the data for many applications that support replication, extension, and interpretation of
ITP studies in the context of lifespan, health span, and disease biology research. This will help maximize the
value of these data and provide the traceability and reproducibility required for extension and translation of the
outcomes of ITP testing."
10874268,"The objectives of the Administrative Core of the proposed Penn Roybal Center are to provide infrastructure
and governance in support of behavioral economics and health research at the University of Pennsylvania and
among affiliated faculty at other universities. There are tremendous opportunities to apply insights from
behavioral economics to health behavior change and delivery science, but significant challenges remain. Chief
among these are the challenges of bringing promising interventions to scale. There are numerous places along
the NIH Stage Model of Behavior Change where the path to scaling can be disrupted, from the generation of
mechanistically well motivated ideas that are shown to be feasible and acceptable in Stage 1 studies to proof
of efficacy in research or real-world settings (Stages 2 and 3), proof of effectiveness (Stage 4), and
dissemination and implementation (Stage 5).
A goal of our Roybal Center is to reduce `voltage drops' along this pathway by embedding user-center design,
allowing for self-service customization to increase both initial efficacy and the ability to engage broader
populations for effectiveness studies; incorporating use of scalable platforms in testing to support potential
translation of research into dissemination and implementation; and by leveraging dynamic adaptation to
increase efficacy and effectiveness. In all of this we plan to work closely with testing and implementation
partners who have wide reach, collectively with access to more than 100 million Americans including diverse
populations.
The Specific Aims of the Administrative Core of our Roybal Center are to:
1.) Provide central administrative support to plan, coordinate, and manage the Center's activities;
2.) Manage the External Advisory Committee that oversees the scientific direction of the Center;
3.) Oversee identification, review, development, and monitoring of pilot projects using the NIH Stage Model;
4.) Encourage and facilitate the development of networks among researchers;
5.) Build strategic collaborations with private and public sector entities to support testing of promising ideas"
10874269,"The goal of the Behavioral Intervention Development Core (BID Core) is to conduct innovative pilot research
aligned with the goals of the NIA Roybal Centers for Translational Research on Aging and with scientific
direction provided by the External Advisory Committee (EAC). We will support pilot studies in Stages 0-IV of
the NIH Stage Model for behavior change, focusing on Stage IA pilots to modify, adapt, and refine existing
interventions and Stage IB feasibility pilots, and will advance to later stages as appropriate. Pilot testing will be
concentrated in our thematic focus areas for this funding announcement including Utilizing Behavioral
Economic Approaches to Improve Individual Behavior and/or Institutional Processes, Targeting Mechanisms of
Behavior Change Common to Multiple Health Behaviors, Leveraging Technology to Ensure Fidelity and/or
Scalability, and Promoting Adherence and Maintenance of Long-term Behavior Change. In addition, our pilots
will leverage human-centered design to improve the user experience, deploy technology platforms that
facilitate testing ideas at scale, and use artificial intelligence (AI)-informed dynamic adaptation to improve the
effectiveness of interventions under resource constraints.
The primary aim of the BID Core is to support mechanistically-grounded pilot projects with the potential—
through rigorous design, refinement, and feasibility testing, followed by efficacy and effectiveness testing—to
translate ideas from behavioral economics into practice and to improve health among middle-aged and older
Americans with modifiable risk for morbidity and mortality. We will prioritize the mentorship and training of
junior faculty and trainees, interaction between investigators at Penn and other universities, and the building of
effective collaborations with organizations that can translate research finding into results at scale.
In addition to the pilots supported through this proposal, we will continue to utilize other sources of support,
including federal and private sources, to advance a broader portfolio of research of high relevance to the
Roybal mission. Our BID Core will emphasize pilots that advance us towards success in bridging the efficacy-
to-effectiveness gap and solving for scale. We will also leverage the three strategic foci of our proposal:
design thinking, digital platforms, and dynamic adaptation. Our strategic foci will inform all funded pilots,
and will increase our ability to engage diverse populations, to do so at scale, and to “learn as we go” for rapid
and relevant results."

also facilitate the protection of human subjects by developing and deploying secure hardware and software
solutions for storage and transmission of data containing private health information. In conjunction with the
Developmental Core, we will offer opportunities for training and mentorship in data collection, management and
analysis.
The BDMC, which is embedded in the Regional Data Center of the East Africa Regional Consortium of the
International Epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA), will use its expertise with advanced analytical
methods and management of data generated from multiple programs, hardware and software platforms and
countries in the region to accomplish the following three inter-related Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Provide statistical leadership in study design, data analysis and presentation of results for all
projects proposed by the Consortium.
Specific Aim 2: Offer informatics and data management expertise in the collection, harmonization, validation,
integration and overall management of data generated by all research projects proposed in this application.
Specific Aim 3: Serve as focal point for mentorship and training in informatics, data management and analysis
for all members of the Institute, build technical and research capacity in informatics and statistics and develop a
culture of rigorous study design, experimentation and reproducible research.
Through these efforts, the BDMC will enable a culture of openness, sharing and reproducible research by
developing operating procedures for collection, management, secure storage of research data and archiving of
data and analysis software and will contribute to capacity building in the region by providing training and
education with respect to study design and data literacy"
10875480,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
This is the second competing renewal application for a Ruth L. Kirschstein Institutional National Research
Service Award (T32), which was originally established in 2009 to provide closely mentored, multidisciplinary
postdoctoral research training to highly promising physician-scientists and PhDs and prepare them for careers
as independent cardiovascular investigators. Since its inception, we have enrolled a total of eighteen trainees,
including two under-represented minorities. Almost all graduates of our program have contributed significantly
to the cardiovascular literature and a substantial proportion have obtained full-time academic or industry
positions engaged in biomedical investigation. Four graduates of the program have been recruited to the
faculty of our Division of Cardiology as full-time physician-investigators and all have competed successfully for
independent NIH or AHA funding. There are two major changes in this competing renewal application. First,
reflecting the growing cadre of faculty at NYU School of Medicine investigating cardiovascular complications of
diabetes and metabolic disorders and the tight integration of research in our Divisions of Cardiology and
Endocrinology, in this renewal we have renamed this T32 the Training Program in Cardiometabolic Diseases
and have named Dr. Ira Goldberg, Director of Endocrinology to the role of co-Program Director (PD). Second,
as an anticipated consequence of implementing the ABIM Research Pathway and Clinical Investigator
Pathway into our Internal Medicine residency program, we have a growing pipeline of highly talented MD and
MD/PhD fellows seeking intensive postdoctoral research training program as the next step in their goal of
launching independent research careers. Therefore, we are requesting an expansion of this T32 training
program to six positions each year. As in the past, the training program is built upon a foundation of highly
accomplished and experienced NIH-funded primary faculty members. The curriculum includes rigorous
didactics, a personalized mentoring plan, and an intensive research experience. The training program begins
with a broad-based educational curriculum that provides all trainees with a fundamental knowledge-base that
stresses research tools and the interface between biomedical research and important manifestations of
cardiovascular disease. Trainees will then pursue more specialized coursework and embark upon a substantial
laboratory-based or clinical research project under the guidance of a Primary Mentor in one of several areas of
institutional strength: Myocardial/Ion Channel Biology and Disease; Vascular Biology and Disease; Metabolic
Causes of Cardiovascular Disease, and Clinical Research. Given our track-record, we are confident that
continued support for this program will produce a steady pipeline of highly talented and motivated investigators
who are committed to enhancing cardiovascular/cardiometabolic health in the United States and elsewhere."

 This new proposal seeks continuing support for a proven and thriving T32 Molecular Biophysics
Predoctoral Training Program at the University of Colorado, Boulder (CU), currently in its 19th year. The
goal of the Biophysics Training Program is to provide exceptional training to a diverse cohort of promising
trainees, thereby preparing them for leading-edge research careers at the interface of Biology, Chemistry,
Engineering and Physics – or for a broad range of other careers. The 39 training faculty include
internationally recognized established investigators and rising young stars from 5 PhD-granting
departments: Biochemistry, Chemical & Biological Engineering, Chemistry, Molecular, Cellular &
Developmental Biology, and Physics. These faculty and their students use state-of-the-art biophysical
approaches to elucidate fundamental aspects of macromolecular structure, dynamics, mechanism, and
regulation in systems ranging from single molecules to live cells, with direct relevance to human health.
 Biophysics is one of the core areas of research on the Boulder campus. Of the 39 training faculty, 22
were hired since the program began, including 10 in the last 5 years. The Biophysics Training Program
has been a key driving force behind this growth. The training program, jointly supported by NIH and CU
Boulder funds, has established a thriving biophysical community with extensive collaborations and large
numbers of joint between biophysicists in different laboratories and departments. Moreover, the program
provides highly robust, innovative training for predoctoral students of biophysics, ensuring they receive a
broad, interdisciplinary foundation needed for current and future success. The newly enhanced training
program combines successful features of the existing program with new elements designed to further
increase program diversity and prepare students to effectively navigate the constantly evolving modern
workforce. Trainees focus on their home PhD program in year 1, then are appointed as Biophysics
trainees in years 2-3 of their graduate studies. Required program elements include core Biophysics
courses and training in Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) and Rigor and Reproducibility (R&R).
An array of other program activities, many newly added, provide training in critical thinking, self-efficacy,
technical expertise, social proficiency, ethical grounding, sound scientific method, professional skills,
teamwork, and leadership skills. The Biophysics trainees, faculty, courses and other program elements
are regularly assessed to enable timely, effective responses to excellence and challenges as they arise.
 Strong outcomes indicate that the program provides highly effective training and support to
Biophysics trainees, as demonstrated by 1) recruitment of high quality students and faculty, 2) increased
participation by underrepresented groups, 3) strong trainee publication, graduation, and career
placement rates, 4) extensive collaborations between training laboratories, and 5) training innovations."

Despite recent advances in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, heart failure (HF) following myocardial
infarction (MI) continues to be the leading cause of death in the U.S., and the rest of the western world. One of
our goals is the development of new, minimally invasive tissue-engineered therapies for the treatment of MI.
While cell therapies have been extensively studied for the treatment of MI and HF, meta-analyses of initial cell
therapy trials suggest only a modest effect on cardiac function. Injectable biomaterials that stimulate endogenous
repair are an attractive, potentially more effective alternative since therapies could still be delivered minimally
invasively via catheter, yet could be off the shelf and have significantly reduced costs and complications
compared to cell products. The PI’s lab developed the first cardiac specific injectable hydrogel, a myocardial
matrix hydrogel, which is derived from decellularized porcine myocardial extracellular matrix (ECM) and is
deliverable via a transendocardial injection catheter. This material is liquid at room temperature and forms a
porous and fibrous scaffold upon injection, which we have shown promotes pro-remodeling immune cell
polarization, other endogenous cell infiltration and cardiac repair in subacute and chronic MI models. This initial
work led to a successful Phase I clinical trial in post-MI patients. However, this approach is not amenable to
treating acute MI patients because of safety issues related to transendocardial injections. Therefore, significant
damage and remodeling of the heart will occur before a patient is even eligible for this therapy. In contrast to
transendocardial delivery, intracoronary infusion can be performed in acute MI patients as interventional
cardiologists are already performing a balloon angioplasty. We therefore recently developed a new infusible form
of ECM (iECM) that can be delivered via intracoronary infusion to coat and fill gaps of damaged vasculature to
heal the tissue. We have already shown this is effective when delivered immediately post-reperfusion in a rat
acute MI model and in a pilot pig study. In acute MI, we hypothesize that iECM promotes endothelial cell survival
and polarization of infiltrating immune cells to a pro-remodeling phenotype, which secondarily along with an
already demonstrated reduction in vascular permeability results in improved cardiomyocyte survival. Our
preliminary results provide strong support for the use of our new iECM technology for treating acute MI. In this
proposal, we will better understand the immunomodulatory and regenerative potential of our iECM technology
and perform translational studies with the goal of developing a novel therapy for acute MI."
10875496,"ABSTRACT:
Keratoconus and related corneal ectatic diseases cause significantly decreased quality of life, are the leading
cause for full thickness corneal transplant in the US, and are significantly more prevalent than previously thought.
Corneal cross-linking (CXL) has emerged as a clinical technique to halt keratoconus progression by stiffening
the corneal stroma. Despite being used clinically for more than a decade, it is currently impossible to assess
CXL protocol efficacy or predict the long-term stability and because we lack quantitative biomechanical measures
to inform predictive models. Currently available metrics to characterize CXL responses are morphologic and
have not proven predictive of clinical outcomes. The major gap is the lack of measurement techniques that can
accurately and non-perturbatively characterize corneal mechanics with three-dimensional (3-D) resolution in
vivo. To address this need, in the past decade we have pioneered Brillouin microscopy, a high-resolution optical
technology that can measure corneal longitudinal modulus in situ in 3-D without contacting or perturbing the eye.
Brillouin microscopy has provided the first and only direct mechanical evidence of decreased modulus in
keratoconus corneas in vivo and the only 3-D maps of CXL-induced corneal stiffening. The overall goal of this
research program is to combine 3-D Brillouin corneal maps and finite element (FE) modeling to quantitatively
predict corneal shape outcomes after CXL protocols. In strong preliminary data, we demonstrated that, by
accounting for tissue hydration, we can establish the quantitative relationship between Brillouin-measured
longitudinal modulus and Young’s modulus. Thus, our central hypothesis is that spatial maps of corneal Young’s
modulus derived from quantitative Brillouin microscopy will enable accurate prediction of corneal shape behavior
via FE modeling. The development of this noninvasive measure of corneal stiffness also enables us to use a
rabbit model to evaluate, for the first time, both morphologic and mechanical evolution in longitudinal studies in
vivo, validated by direct mechanical analysis using experimental protocols that cannot be performed in human
subjects. We will test our central hypothesis through the three specific aims: 1) Validate in vivo Brillouin
mechanical measurements after CXL; 2) Quantify the in vivo mechanical outcomes of novel CXL protocols; and
3) Link CXL biomechanical impact to morphologic outcome with Brillouin imaging and FE modeling. This
research is significant because accurate nondestructive, nonperturbative elasticity-based metrics will drive a
paradigm shift in how CXL protocols are evaluated, developed, and performed clinically as well as ultimately
allow us to develop individualized CXL treatment protocols."

This competitive renewal application for the University of Pennsylvania’s (PENN) Ruth L. Kirschstein National
Research Service Award T32 Cancer Center Research Training Program seeks continued support to train and
mentor physician scientists to develop a productive career in basic, translational and clinical research relevant
to cancer medicine, acquiring skills that facilitate new discoveries with potential for direct translation to patient
care. Our Training Program provides the critical protected time, mentorship, resources, educational experience,
and environment necessary to achieve this goal. The Program is bolstered by the remarkable physical and
human resources and strong institutional commitments of PENN and its Abramson Cancer Center, along with
the Center for Childhood Cancer Research at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The supporting
infrastructure and the physical facilities create an environment that is designed to nurture and produce physician
investigators committed to careers in academic medicine. Our Program, continuously funded for three decades,
has been highly successful in developing the careers of young physician scientists. We currently have six training
slots, all for post-doctoral trainees, and have focused on providing research training for adult and pediatric
oncology MD and MD/PhD fellows in their 2nd and 3rd year of ACGME-accredited fellowship training programs at
CHOP and PENN. Since inception, this ACC T32 has trained approximately one hundred outstanding young
investigators, who have and are continuing to produce seminal advances in the field, including current world
leaders in cancer research such as John Maris (CHOP) and W. Kimryn Rathmell (Vanderbilt), and emerging
leaders such as David Barrett (CHOP), Shannon Maude (CHOP) and Alfred Garfall (PENN). Over the past twenty
years we have supported 68 trainees, including 6 current trainees. Of the 61 living trainee graduates, 36 hold
faculty positions as an Assistant (20), Associate Professor (12), or Professor (4) in academic medicine, 9
continue as an Instructor (8) or advanced subspecialty fellow (1), 10 hold leadership positions in the
pharmaceutical industry, 1 is an FDA Medical Officer, and only 5 are in community-based oncology practices.
We select trainees based on their demonstrated commitment and promise for cancer research. Once enrolled,
our trainees develop a tailored curriculum based on their specific research interests, the core of which is a
research project conducted in the laboratory of their mentor, supplemented by didactic coursework and research
seminars. Trainee progress is closely monitored with an individualized plan that is customized for each Trainee
by their Scholarship Oversight Committee. The T32 Executive Committee and a new Advisory Committee review
overall programmatic performance and individual Trainee success as measured by publications, funding, and
independent careers in cancer research. This allows us to continually assess whether we are achieving program
goals, and identifies opportunities for program modifications to meet the needs of our Trainees, which have
evolved over time with the field of cancer medicine."

We are requesting NINDS support for a Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Mechanisms of Epilepsy
and Neuronal Synchronization and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for young investigators to be held
August 17-23, 2024 at the Mount Snow Resort in West Dover, Vt. This will be the ninth Epilepsy Gordon
Research Conference, and the third Epilepsy Gordon Research Seminar. The overall aim of this GRC is to
bring together established and early career researchers, students, and postdoctoral fellows for 5 days in an
intensive, interactive environment to present and discuss state-of-the-art, unpublished findings related to basic
mechanisms of epilepsy, current translational studies and synchronization of neuronal activity in cerebral
networks. The conference is designed to involve extensive discussion, and the environment is specifically
geared towards fostering interactions between graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and established
researchers, and to facilitate intense in-depth discussions and generate collaborations between investigators
in the interest of furthering the field. The GRS, a 2-day conference which precedes the GRC at the same site,
provides additional opportunities for students and postdoctoral fellows to present their work and engage in
intensive scientific and career mentoring with established investigators in the field. Another critical goal of this
GRC and its associated GRS is to increase the representation of women, racial/ethnic minorities, persons
with disabilities, and other individuals who have been traditionally underrepresented in the epilepsy research
workforce by engaging them as attendees and assuring that they are well represented as speakers and
discussion leaders at both the GRC and GRS.
The specific theme of this GRC is “Multiscale Dynamics in the Emergence of Epilepsies”, and the GRS
program theme will be “Transformations in Epilepsy”, both focusing on how basic science discoveries
regarding the complex mechanisms that underlie the abnormal, synchronous, electrical discharges in
hyperexcitable neuronal networks during seizures can be effectively utilized to develop new therapies for the
70 million people worldwide suffering with epilepsy. The conference will bring together geneticists, molecular
biologists, developmental neuroscientists, immunologists, electrophysiologists, clinician-scientists and
computational neuroscientists working on the full spectrum of epilepsy research from studies of basic
mechanisms through preclinical and human research. Our goals are to disseminate the latest scientific
advances, to foster productive new insights and collaborations, to stimulate an interest in epilepsy research
among young investigators and to increase the diversity of the epilepsy research workforce, with the ultimate
goal of accelerating the delivery of desperately needed new therapies to people with epilepsy."

Candidate: My career goal is to develop an independent research program that examines how hierarchical
transformations of auditory information downstream of core auditory cortex supports sound-driven decisions. My
previous training experiences has provided me with technical and intellectual skills on auditory neurophysiology,
behavioral neuroscience, and hearing loss-induced deficits in auditory processing and perception. I propose to
expand my skill set with additional training by conducting wireless cortical recordings while gerbils simultaneously
perform a complex auditory task, pharmacological and chemogenetic attenuation of neural activity in awake-
behaving animals, and statistical modeling of psychophysical and neural data. During the K99 phase, I will
prepare my transition to independence by developing the necessary skills for producing a successful chalk talk,
plan job interview strategies, and gain effective lab management applications. By the end of the R00 phase, I
plan to have a strong publication record and ample preliminary data that will lead to a successful R01 application.
Environment: The K99 phase of this will be award will take place in the Center for Neural Science at New York
University; an ideal location for the proposed training phase of this award. My primary mentor, Dr. Dan Sanes,
possesses 30+ years of experience in developmental plasticity and auditory neuroscience. His laboratory utilizes
innovative physiological, pharmacological, and anatomical techniques that include in vitro slice physiology,
wireless extracellular awake-behaving recordings, pharmacological manipulation of neural activity, optogenetics,
and anatomical tract tracing with viral vectors. Additional mentoring will be provided by Dr. Xiaoqin Wang (John
Hopkins University), who has 25+ years of experience as an expert in the neural coding of acoustic information
along the auditory neuroaxis and neurophysiological recordings in awake preparations, and Dr. Roozbeh Kiani
(New York University), who is an expert in the neural mechanisms of perceptual decision-making.
Research: The neural representations of acoustic signals are transformed at each locus of an ascending
auditory pathway. An example of a principal characteristic of this hierarchical processing is the increase of
integration time (i.e., the time required to fully encode a sensory cue) across higher auditory cortices. Currently,
it is less certain how auditory information is transformed downstream from core auditory cortex (ACx) where it
becomes integrated with other sensory inputs, and supports sound-driven decisions. Perturbations of neural
activity in parietal cortex (PC), a region downstream of ACx, will be made in animals performing an auditory
temporal integration task to determine whether PC is necessary for the observed behavioral temporal integration
times (K99). Wireless recordings will be made in ACx and PC from awake-behaving animals performing an
auditory temporal integration task to reveal the neural representations that support perceptual integration times
(K99). Similar approaches will be used to determine whether the neural representation of PC correlates and
supports task performance during a combined multisensory condition (R00)."

The ability to perform rapid, goal-directed movements accurately and efficiently is critical for interacting with the
environment. These movements have provided a key behavioral paradigm for experimental and clinical study,
helping to establish theories of sensorimotor control and to characterize motor impairments in many neurological
disorders. The accurate execution of rapid, goal-directed movements is enabled by the characteristic, reciprocal
activation of opposing muscles that accelerate and decelerate the limb in a temporally precise manner. Many
sensorimotor disorders across the nervous system (e.g. sensory deafferentation and cerebellar disease) disrupt
this characteristic muscle activation, leading to impaired motor performance. Therefore, the emergence and
disruption of this stereotyped pattern of muscle recruitment offer theoretical and clinical insights into how
sensorimotor circuits enable speed and accuracy. Yet the neural mechanisms that establish and control this
reciprocal muscle recruitment remain elusive, in large part because the relative contribution of proprioceptive
feedback from the muscles has not been clearly established. Although behavioral observations and
computational models have implicated proprioceptive feedback in coordinating limb movements, the direct
causal role of these sensory pathways in driving temporally precise muscle activation in intact, behaving animals
has been difficult to investigate. The challenge is due, in part, to the inability of traditional experimental methods
to perturb specific neural circuits in a temporally precise and reversible manner. To address these issues, this
proposal will combine a computational model of the spinal sensorimotor system with temporally precise, circuit
specific manipulation of the following: a) selective proprioceptive afferent pathways and b) a set of inhibitory
spinal interneurons that modulate the strength of proprioceptive feedback in behaving mice. Specifically, two
Aims will address key outstanding questions: 1) What are the specific proprioceptive feedback pathways that
contribute to stereotyped muscle activation patterns during the acceleration and deceleration phases of limb
movement, and during which phases of movement is proprioceptive feedback required (Aim 1)? 2) How does
temporally precise modulation of feedback strength (gain) by spinal interneurons ensure appropriate muscle
activation patterns (Aim 2)? The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that the amplitude and timing of
agonist and antagonist muscle activity depend critically on temporally precise tuning of selective proprioceptive
feedback pathways, and disruption of such feedback causes aberrant and inaccurate movements. Answering
these questions will help to uncover the computational logic implemented by sensorimotor pathways for the
accurate and efficient execution of rapid movements and reveal how disruption of these pathways produces
motor deficits. In addition, by defining spinal circuit mechanisms that control limb movement, this work will lay
the groundwork for future studies investigating how descending motor systems recruit spinal circuits to ensure
appropriate muscle activation patterns."
10877528,"Summary
Generating the appropriate numbers of cells in a particular lineage is critical for normal
development of the brain. Progenitor cells of both neuronal and glial lineages are present in the
postnatal subventricular zone (SVZ) of rats, with a period of gliogenesis that is maximal during
the first two postnatal weeks. We find that the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is abundantly
expressed in intermediate progenitor cells in the rat SVZ. Deletion of this receptor elicits an
overproduction of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and precocious maturation of these cells with
abnormal myelin development during the early stages of myelination, suggesting that p75NTR
normally acts to restrict premature differentiation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells. This
expression of p75NTR in the SVZ has been observed in rat and human, but not mouse, and we
suggest that this may be a mechanism that evolved to regulate the timing and balance between
generating cells of a particular lineage while maintaining a pool of progenitor cells in an
immature state. We will create a cell-specific rat line to delete p75NTR (p75NTRfl/fl) specifically in
oligodendrocyte progenitors (PDGFRa-CreERT2), and use this line as well as the global p75NTR
KO rats to investigate mechanisms by which p75NTR regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation
and maturation. Additionally, we will determine whether deletion of p75NTR impacts the
persistence of the oligodendrocyte progenitor pool in the SVZ. We will assess whether the
altered regulation of oligodendrocyte progenitors during development in the p75NTR KO rats
impacts the ability to remyelinate after a demyelinating lesion in adult rats."
10877530,"ABSTRACT
The development of the cochlear implant (CI) has revolutionized the treatment of severe hearing loss. Despite
its overall success, not every patient who receives a CI will benefit from this technology. The limitation lies not
within the technology itself, but primarily within the high level of diversity in the population of people who qualify
for CI surgery. Each CI recipient has a distinct hearing-loss profile and clinical background, which imparts
unique deafness-induced changes to each level of their auditory system, including the brain. Currently, it is
unclear how individual differences within the cortical auditory system, specifically in speech-evoked brain
activity, contribute to individual variability in CI speech-recognition outcomes. One reason for this gap in
knowledge is that the electromagnetic signals emitted from a CI can disrupt traditional neuroimaging methods.
A new optical neuroimaging tool, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), offers a CI-compatible imaging
option that is non-invasive and unaffected by electromagnetic artifact. The knowledge gained from recent
fNIRS investigations has not yet translated into clinical practice because results are often only reported at the
group level; the reliability of fNIRS measurements remains somewhat poor on the single-subject level. The
proposed research addresses this issue of reliability by controlling for the interference from systemic
physiological signals in single-subject fNIRS recordings. In Aim 1, we will determine the contribution of
naturally occurring, non-neural physiological signals to the within-subject variability in fNIRS recordings using
systemic physiology augmented fNIRS (SPA-fNIRS). In Aim 2, we will determine the relationship between CI
speech-recognition ability and speech-evoked brain activity measured via SPA-fNIRS using naturalistic
connected speech signals. This investigation will use an individualized approach to examine cortical-speech
processing in adult CI recipients. The findings from this proposal have the potential to reveal underlying
sources of individual variability in CI recipients due to differences in their cortical processing of speech. The
use of novel connected-speech passages to elicit brain activity in individual CI users will increase the
ecological validity of our approach, which is an important step toward translating research findings into clinical
practice. Our proposal aims to improve the tools used to objectively measure speech-evoked brain activity in
single subjects so that personalized auditory-rehabilitation training can be prescribed to help individuals
engage more effective speech-processing strategies."
10883485,"Maternal substance use disorders are a substantial public health concern and the neurological consequences
of prenatal exposure are a major threat to the long-term health of offspring. Globally, prevalence of Fetal
Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000,
respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high
as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central
nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood and followed
through into adolescence. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early
intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to
address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum
to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories, and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed
prospectively from birth to age 12 years. Data: Our cohort includes a highly characterized subsample of
children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South
Africa, who have been scanned as neonates, 2-years, and 6 years of age. Preliminary published data shows
highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes at each of these
timepoints as well as altered white matter maturational trajectories. An additional longitudinal assessment at
12-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 4 distinct time points (infants, toddlers, children and
adolescents), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this
previously understudied full childhood range. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the
presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity
in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 12 years, and the relationships with
facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as
neonates, 2–years and 6 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-
point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented
opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical
years through early adolescence, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term
clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental trajectories
leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting
interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early
diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers."

 Only the microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) human colorectal cancer, which accounts for 10-15% of all
human colorectal cancer cases, responds to PD-(L)1 blockade immunotherapy. The vast majority (85-90%)
of human colorectal cancer is the microsatellite stable (MSS) subtype that does not respond to PD-(L)1
blockade immunotherapy. PD-(L)1 blockade immunotherapy works through blocking PD-1 function to activate
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The activated CTLs then target tumor cells to activate the death pathways to
induce tumor cell death. Therefore, two factors are essential for the efficacy of PD-(L)1 blockade
immunotherapy: CTLs must be activated and the target tumor cells must be sensitive to cell death induction.
Human colorectal tumor cells, especially the metastatic colorectal tumor cells, are highly resistant to cell death
induction. Literature and our published data indicate that, although MSI-H human colorectal cancer has high
level of tumor-infiltrating CTLs, CTLs are also present in the MSS human colorectal carcinoma. Our published
data further determined that tumor-infiltrating CTLs are functionally impaired in human colorectal carcinoma.
SUV39H1 is a histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) site-specific histone methyltransferase that catalyzes H3K9me3.
Literature and our preliminary studies determined that the SUV39H1-H3K9me3 epigenetic axis represses both
the death receptor FAS expression in human metastatic colon tumor cells and Gzmb expression in colon
tumor-infiltrating CTLs. To target SUV39H1-H3K9me3 axis, we have developed a small molecule SUV39H1-
selective inhibitor (termed F5446). We determined that F5446 is effective in: 1) decreasing H3K9me3
deposition at the FAS promoter in metastatic human colon tumor cells to increase tumor cell sensitivity to
FasL-induced cell death; and 2) decreasing H3K9me3 deposition at the Gzmb promoter to increase Gzmb
expression in tumor-infiltrating CTLs to suppress colon tumor growth in immune competent mice. To achieve
tumor-selective delivery for improved safety and efficacy, we have now developed the expansile nanoparticle
encapsulated F5446 (termed eNP-F5446). Our hypothesis is that eNP-F5446 is an effective and safe agent
for overcoming colorectal cancer resistance to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy. Three specific aims will be
pursue to achieve our objectives: 1) determine the tumor/cell/subcellular localization, trafficking, and
biodistribution of eNP-F5446 in the syngeneic mouse colon tumor liver metastasis and human colon cancer
xenograft liver metastasis models; 2) conduct pharmacokinetics and toxicology studies of eNP-F5446 in
tumor-free and colon tumor-bearing mice; 3) determine the efficacy of eNP-F5446 in overcoming human
metastatic colorectal cancer resistance to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in vivo."

Increased glucose and fat metabolism are essential for tumor progression. Recent work showed that cold-
induced activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT), a unique adipose tissue which produces heat via glycolysis
and fat metabolism, suppressed tumor progression in several cancer mouse models due to competition for
glucose and fat resources. White adipose tissue (WAT) is an endocrine tissue that functions as the main energy
storage organ in our body, storing lipids and secreting hormones that regulate various biological functions,
including appetite, glucose and fat metabolism, and insulin hemostasis. It is commonly used in clinical
procedures such as liposuction and fat transplantation in plastic surgery. Thus, WAT could be readily
used for cellular therapy. Here, we propose to showcase the utility of this approach, which we term as Adipose
Manipulation Transplantation (AMT), for cancer therapy. We plan to bioengineer WAT and adipose organoids
to become more BAT-like, which will increase their glucose and fat utilization, along with having increased
glucose uptake and fat storage. This will be done using CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) to upregulated genes
that are involved in BAT function and glucose and fat metabolism. Our preliminary results already show that co-
culturing CRISPRa engineered BAT-like adipocytes with five different cancer cell lines suppresses their
growth. Furthermore, implanting engineered adipose organoids with xenografts or in two cancer genetic
mouse models (breast and pancreas) significantly reduces cancer growth. Finally, engineering
adipocytes from eight different human breast cancer patients surgically resected tissue and co-culturing
them with cancer organoids significantly reduced organoid growth. Here, we plan to build on these results.
We will engineer adipocytes and organoids to have increased glucose and fat utilization by upregulating
combinations of genes not only involved in browning, but also in glucose and fat metabolism and glucose
transport and test their ability to reduce cancer growth in various cancer cell models (Aim 1). We will also test
the ability of these CRISPRa gene combinations in adipose organoids to suppress cancer in xenograft cancer
models from various cell lines (breast, colon, pancreas, prostate) and in several genetic mouse models (breast
and pancreas) (Aim 2). Finally, to further dissect the translational potential of this approach, we will use surgically
resected tumor tissue from breast cancer patients, isolate and engineer their adipocytes and then co-culture
them with their respective tumor to assess their therapeutic potential (Aim 3). This will be done across the full
spectrum of human breast cancer stages, including different stages of breast cancer (adjuvant, late recurrence,
metastasis, challenging-to-treat breast cancer subtypes and BRCA mutations). Combined, this project will
develop a novel ‘CAR T like’ therapeutic approach to treat cancer utilizing bioengineered adipocytes, having
tremendous therapeutic implications for cancer treatment."

interfere with daily functioning. It is also associated with comorbid diagnoses such as posttraumatic stress
disorder, depression, pain, dementia, and suicidal ideation. As such, early detection and coordinated treatment
are critical for preventing chronic dysfunction, disability, and early mortality among Veterans with TBI history.
The VA Polytrauma/TBI System of Care (PSC), through a regional, integrated structure, serves this function by
overseeing and providing screening, evaluation, education, and evidence-based treatment for those in need of
TBI-related care. The PSC will care for this substantial patient population for decades to come.
Since the 2014 passage of the Veterans Choice Act and, more recently, the VA MISSION Act, the VA has
been outsourcing larger amounts of healthcare to non-VA providers (“Community Care”). VA Community Care
may improve Veterans’ access to care; however, dual use of healthcare systems and providers can lead to
poor outcomes due to fragmentation of care. Preliminary work has suggested that higher proportions of
Veterans with TBI diagnoses, relative to those without TBI, are receiving VA Community Care services, and
that this may be leading to the receipt of therapies that are not recommended for patients with TBI.
Significance/Impact: This study will inform the development and implementation of strategies to enhance the
care received by Veterans with TBI who use VA Community Care services. This work will identify gaps in the
provision of evidence-based TBI care in a timely manner, as VA Community Care services continue to expand
under the new MISSION Act. Our results will help ensure that Veterans with TBI receive care that is
coordinated, interdisciplinary, and evidence-based, and that promotes their optimal health and functioning.
Innovation: This project will develop new knowledge about Community Care utilization and outcomes among
Veterans receiving care for TBI, a high-priority, clinically-complex patient population. It will be the first, to our
knowledge, to measure patient-reported health and functional outcomes among Veterans who receive
Community Care. Additionally, we will link to multiple VA and Department of Defense (DoD) databases to
objectively account for differences in characteristics between those who do and do not use Community Care.
Specific Aims: Our aims are to: (1) Describe utilization of VA Community Care (rates and types of; reliance
on) among Post-9/11 Veterans with TBI; (2) Estimate associations between Veterans’ reliance on Community
Care and their health and functional outcomes; and (3) Understand Veterans’ need for, perceptions of, and
experiences with VA Community Care.
Methodology: This 4-year, mixed-methods project will link data identifying Post-9/11 Veterans with TBI to
administrative data identifying VA healthcare use including Community Care. For Aim 1, we will examine
patterns of Community Care use (rates and types of; reliance on) over time and by Veterans’
sociodemographics, military history, TBI severity, medical complexity, and PSC utilization history. For Aim 2,
we will survey a stratified, random sample of 1,800 Veterans with TBI to estimate associations between their
reliance on Community Care and their health and functional outcomes, while accounting for potential
confounders and sources of bias. For Aim 3, we will interview 100 Veterans to examine factors related to their
access to, satisfaction with, trust of, and actual and perceived quality of Community Care.
Implementation/Next Steps: This work may identify subgroups of Veterans whose healthcare needs are not
being met and who are at risk of poor outcomes. Results will inform strategies to ensure continued delivery of
coordinated, high-quality care across the entire spectrum in which Veterans with TBI are receiving VA care."
11118785,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a deadly malignancy with survival <35% at 5 years and occurs across the
lifespan afflicting both young and older male and female veterans. Current treatment options of surgery,
mitotane and chemotherapy are inadequate. The mechanisms underlying ACC tumorigenesis are poorly
understood. Patients with genetic syndromes have an increased risk of ACC; however, the majority of cases
are sporadic. To date, no pathway has been successfully targeted in ACC in clinical trials. Lack of progress in
the field has been attributable to the lack of cell and animal models of ACC. Until recently, only one ACC tumor
cell line and no animal models were available. We have approached this unmet need by the development of
4 new human ACC cell lines and the first patient derived xenograft (PDX) animal models (N=5) with a strategy
to use these pre-clinical models to test bioinformatically identified targets for novel therapeutics. Our
overarching goal is to understand the diverse molecular pathogenesis of human ACC and identify novel targets
to test in our new cell and animal models. We analyzed multiple publically available genomic databases for
candidate genes that are dysregulated and noted that ACC tumors harbored a consistent dysregulation of cell
cycle control and DNA damage pathway constituents. We identified PBK (PDZ binding kinase) as the highest
dysregulated candidate. PBK has been identified as a master regulator of mitotic proteins and is critical for
cytokinesis. Its downstream effectors are cell specific. Although low or undetectable in most normal human
tissues, it is overexpressed in diverse cancers including breast, colon, lung, prostate and lymphomas. Our
preliminary data show that PBK controls the tumorigenic phenotype in ACC and that targeting PBK with either
shPBK or the PBK inhibitor, HITOPK032, reduced cell proliferation and tumorigenic growth in our pre-clinical
models. This application will dissect the mechanisms by which PBK inhibition or targeting exert their anti-
tumorigenic effects. In addition, we propose to test the effects of PBK targeting in combination with Mitotane
therapy, the only FDA approved drug for adrenal cancer. These studies will test the hypothesis that disruption
of specific components of cell the cycle in conjunction with Mitotane, a known ER stress inducer, will enhance
the anti-tumorigenic responses. Our novel ACC cell lines and PDX models provide a unique opportunity to
advance the understanding of the diverse mechanisms of adrenal cancer tumorigenesis as well as test for the
first time relevant ACC targets that will allow translation to our patients in the clinic. Our studies will fill an
unmet need in the area of endocrine tumorigenesis that afflicts veterans of all ages and shed light into the
biology of this poorly studied cancer. In addition, the data will provide insight into other cancers with these
mitotic kinase drivers which affect veterans every day."
10883496,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Muscles are highly plastic tissues that respond rapidly to a wide variety of stimuli by altering their
composition, contractility, and metabolism. For example, myosin is the most abundant protein in muscle, and
during development, 50% of embryonic myosin is replaced in 3 hours by adult myosins. This is remarkable
given that the average half-life of muscle myosin in vivo at baseline can be >1 month. Also, in terminally
differentiated cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, protein turnover is essential to repair and replace damaged
proteins. Little is known about the rates and mechanisms of protein exchange and turnover in different
muscles. We propose to study these processes in cardiac, fast and slow skeletal muscles, and determine how
they are influenced by biological sex, activity, and disease-causing sarcomeric mutations.
 We have developed two powerful methods to measure protein homeostasis in muscle cells. First, we
will use multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry electron microscopy (MIMS-EM) in mice to define the
spatiotemporal distributions of old and new sarcomeres. MIMS-EM will be complemented by stable isotope
labeling to determine turnover rates of individual proteins. Our data indicate muscle-specific differences for
sarcomeric protein turnover. The fastest rates occur in cardiac muscle, followed by slow skeletal muscles and
then fast skeletal muscles. In a second approach, we developed single myosin molecule live cell imaging in
muscle cells to directly measure sarcomere dynamics. We will also measure the contributions of the ubiquitin
(Ub) proteasome system and autophagy to exchange and turnover. We will investigate which factors
(biological sex and muscle use) regulate turnover rates between different muscles. We will determine the
impact of ubiquitination of myosin on sarcomere dynamics. We will focus on myosin since it is a major
determinant of muscle physiology and function. Moreover, >500 mutations in myosin genes cause a variety
of cardiomyopathies or skeletal myopathies. Our data show that myosin is heavily ubiquitinated in the
human heart, with 68 unique sites. We will carry out Ub-proteomics on human hearts with and without myosin
mutations to assess whether ubiquitinated myosin and sarcomeric proteins are altered in disease. We have
mutagenized the two most heavily ubiquitinated lysines to arginines and have shown that these mutations
delay turnover in cardiac myocytes. Finally, we will define the mechanisms whereby the R1500P MYH7 rod
mutation causes skeletal myopathy while R1500W causes cardiomyopathy. We have shown that the R1500P
mutation affects myosin conformation energetic states and used a small molecule myosin inhibitor in our
R1500P mouse model that improves its phenotypes. We will determine the turnover rates of both mutant
myosin proteins in cardiac myocytes and skeletal myotubes. Finally, we will quantify sarcomere dynamics in
these two cell types using single myosin molecule imaging. The long-term goal of this work is to understand
how muscles remodel their sarcomeres to meet the demands of changing environments."

 Physical activity has been shown to enhance children's executive function (EF) that is fundamental for
reasoning, problem solving, and academic achievement. High-intensity interval training (HIIT), a form of
exercise consisting of short intense exercise bouts separated by recovery intervals, has gained considerable
attention due to its time-efficiency for increasing physical activity and fitness in an enjoyable and reinforcing
manner while generating chronic and acute EF benefits in children. However, none of the existing programs
utilized the recovery intervals during HIIT, which typically consist of passive and mindless breaks, despite
evidence indicating larger cognitive benefits from exercise combined with cognitively engaging activity. The
recovery intervals during HIIT provide an opportunity for mindfulness (MF), a mental exercise of self-
awareness and self-regulation that improves EF. Repeated practice on the flexible regulation of attentional
focus and bodily movement between mindful recovery and exercise bouts is theoretically sound for
maximizing long-term cognitive gains because the added MF activity provides enriched experiences and
cognitive challenges that stimulate the development of EF. HIIT and MF also have similar acute benefits to EF
yet differential impacts on neuroelectric correlates of conflict processing and updating of mental
representation. Thus, HIIT and MF may be complementary as they alter differential functional neural
underpinnings of EF. This proposal aims to test the effectiveness of a novel mindful HIIT intervention for
improving EF in 10 - 12 years old children. By using two active control interventions delivering HIIT without MF
and delivering MF without HIIT as well as a passive control intervention delivering sedentary activities without
inducing MF, we will further determine the unique effects of HIIT, MF, and their combination on children's EF.
Specifically, this proposal will conduct a 12-week school-based cluster-randomized controlled trial and a
laboratory-based acute intervention cross-over trial to investigate the long-term and short-term effects of
mindful HIIT intervention on children's EF. Our central hypothesis is that integrating MF into HIIT will generate
larger long-term and short-term positive effects on children's EF than MF or HIIT intervention along. Outcomes
consistent with our hypotheses will provide novel evidence indicating the effectiveness of chronic and acute
engagement in mindful HIIT for enhancing children's EF. The successful completion of this study will serve to
guide future randomized controlled trials testing the mechanisms and dose-response associations of the long-
term and short-term mindful HIIT interventions with behavioral and neural outcomes of childhood EF. This
research agenda will support the development of scalable and sustainable interventions that uses MF
technique to maximize the positive impacts of exercise on childhood cognitive and brain development while
counteracting many health issues centered around physical inactivity."
10881004,"Extramedullary infiltration of leukemic cells to the meninges (CNS disease/relapse) is a poor prognostic factor
for patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). To date, few studies have investigated the roles
of chemokine receptors and other mediators of signal transduction in driving T-ALL influx to the meninges.
The CXCR3-CXCL10 signaling axis plays a critical role in regulating the entry of specific leukocyte subsets
into inflamed meninges. However, its role in regulating leukemic cell migration and trafficking to the meninges
remains poorly understood. The focus of this proposal is on a unique mechanism by which leukemic cells
hijack an inflammatory pathway to pave the way to the meninges/CNS. We discovered upregulation of CXCR3
chemokine receptor levels in a subset of high-risk T-ALL with CNS disease. Our preliminary findings provide
strong evidence that CXCR3 potentiates T-ALL cell migration and meningeal infiltration. We have compelling
evidence that, in the meningeal microenvironment, T-ALL cells migrate to the meningeal pericytes, which
induce CXCL10 in response to leukemia-derived cytokines. The goal of this study is to address how the
CXCR3-CXCL10 axis mediates T-ALL trafficking to the meninges. We hypothesize that T-ALL exploits the
inflammatory CXCR3-CXCL10 pathway to facilitate meningeal infiltration. Our rationale is that leukemic cells
may adopt pro-inflammatory signaling governing normal T-cell influx during meningitis and neuroinflammation
to trigger meningeal colonization. Using ΔE Notch1-induced T-ALL mouse model and a panel of well-
characterized T-ALL patient derived xenografts we propose to study how the CXCR3-CXCL10 signaling axis
regulates T-ALL cell migration and influx into the meninges. In addition, we will seek to establish a proof of
principle for the therapeutic potential of targeting this signaling pathway for the treatment of CNS-involved T-
ALL. Furthermore, we propose to use microfluidic 3D cell culture systems to model T-ALL cell migration in the
meningeal niche. In Aim 1, we will determine the roles of CXCR3 in T-ALL trafficking to the meninges and will
conduct mechanistic studies unraveling the roles of USP7/TAL1 in regulating CXCR3 expression in migrating
T-ALL cells. In Aim 2, we will investigate how leukemic cells induce a pro-inflammatory phenotype in meningeal
pericytes and how pericyte-derived CXCL10 confers T-ALL tropism to the meninges. Our goal will be to
demonstrate that disseminated leukemic cells induce pro-inflammatory chemokine CXCL10 in the meningeal
microenvironment, forming a supportive niche for leukemic cell influx and colonization. The identification of
the mechanism by which leukemic cells infiltrate the meninges will lead to the development of novel therapies."
10882147,"The overall goal of this proposal is to characterize senescent cells (SnCs) and their communication networks
during fibrosis induced by the foreign body response (FBR), specifically with respect to biomaterials, across the
lifespan. SnCs are rare but impactful cells that contribute to multiple biological processes; to date, their identity
and function in vivo, including interactions with the immune system, remain elusive. We recently discovered
that SnCs contribute to fibrosis induced by the FBR in young animals. In preliminary studies, we found
senescent pericytes and fibroblasts in the FBR that each had a unique senescence-associated secretory
phenotype (SASP) and that communicated with different macrophage subpopulations. We also found
differences in SnC induction and phenotype in older animals, and sex differences in the immune response to
implants in both young and aged mice. In older animals, for example, SnC communication shifted toward
increased communication with T cells. We developed an approach that defines senescence signatures
(SenSigs) from transgenic p16-Cre reporter mice that can be used in combination with transfer learning
methods to predict which cells are senescent in single-cell datasets. Using these transgenic tools and
computational approaches, the proposed research will address long -standing questions of SnC phenotype,
heterogeneity, function, and immunological interactions in the context of fibrosis in the foreign body response.
We anticipate that this will enable development of more sophisticated and targeted senolytic therapies for the
FBR and for fibrosis in general. Our Aims are:
Specific Aim 1. Define senescent cell types and their senescence signature in the FBR across lifespan in
male and female p16-reporter mice.
Specific Aim 2. Define SnCs and their communication patterns in the FBR.
Specific Aim 3. Determine the functional role of SnCs and SnC-subtypes on immune response and tissue
structure."

Infection with Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) for which there is no vaccine is a significant cause of human
morbidity both in the United States and worldwide. Current understanding of humoral immunity to HSV-2 is based
on bulk metrics of antibodies circulating in bloodstream, however everyday battle between virus and host occurs
in microscopic tissue microenvironment which represent a unique immunological niche. Our premise is that study
of local humoral responses will reveal critical, currently unidentified mediators and mechanisms for immune
control of HSV-2. After primary infection, HSV-2 establishes latency in sensory neurons. Clearance and
subsequent control of constantly reactivating HSV-2 in tissue are believed to depend on T cells, but clinical
observations and mathematical models present evidence consistent with essential role for local humoral
responses required to achieve efficient virus control, Our preliminary data has shown that antibody secreting
cells (ASCs) are actively present in genital skin during HSV-2 reactivation and long after virus outbreak is
contained. Using the power of having sequential samples in individual tissue biopsies over time combined with
recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing we demonstrated that these clonally expanded cells commit
to the long-lived plasma cell lineage implying possible tissue residency, Isolation of antibodies from these unique
cells has shown they recognize HSV-2 suggesting they may be directed to as yet unidentified HSV-2 antigens
and/or provide functions important for virus control in the tissue. Therefore, the goal of this project is to thoroughly
define the immunoprotective role of skin antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) against reactivating HSV-2. Underlying
our proposed experiments is the idea that tissue resident ASCs have the ability to contain the virus over long
timeframes via secreting HSV-2 specific antibodies that are essential for virus control due to their specificity
and/or effector functions. Therefore, we focus on critical features of ASCs such as antigenic specificity, gene
expression profile, clonal structure and functional activity of cognate antibodies during symptomatic HSV-2
reactivation and at multiple time points following clearance of a genital skin virus within microscopic sites of
infection. We will also evaluate frequency of essential clones of skin ASCs among circulating B cells that have
direct implication for rational vaccine design allowing targeted vaccination strategies. Ultimately, our goal is to
use the gained insights to develop strategies that will allow for novel approaches to design successful herpes
vaccine and development of immunotherapeutic approaches to treat chronic HSV-2 infection."
10882012,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent advances in cancer immunotherapies have revolutionized lung cancer treatment paradigms. However,
many patients derive little or no benefit from FDA approved immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). A host of clinical
studies have shown that pre-existing tumor-reactive T cells are critically important to achieve benefit from ICI.
Therefore, augmenting the number and functionality of tumor-reactive T cells could pave the way for more
effective cancer treatments. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) have been developed for their ability to specifically replicate
in cancer cells leading to cancer cell lysis but not cytotoxicity towards normal cells. Recent studies indicate that
stimulation of host anti-tumor immunity is also a key mechanism of action of OVs. Using a novel conditionally
replicative adenovirus type 5 that expresses two powerful innate immunity stimulators, the studies proposed here
can lead to the development of highly effective OV-based therapeutic strategies to kill tumor cells and
simultaneously enhance an anti-tumor T cell response. Engagement of CD40 expressed on dendritic cells (DCs)
by CD40 ligand (CD40L) leads to acquisition of crucial cross-priming function to activate CD8 T cells. MEM40 is
a chimeric CD40L engineered for stable cell surface expression. In addition to pro-inflammatory and anti-viral
functions, type 1 IFNs also function as crucial activators of DCs. Our preclinical studies in mouse melanoma and
lung tumor models indicate that intralesional administration of MEM40 + IFNβ expressing oncolytic adenovirus
(MEM-288) we developed induces a robust systemic T cell response that in synergy with ICI is capable of
significantly curtailing abscopal tumor growth. A key effect of CD40L and IFNβ expression in the tumor
microenvironment (TME) was the enhancement of DC activation and migration to draining lymph nodes to induce
T cell priming. These findings prompted us to develop a novel conditionally replicative oncolytic adenovirus
(MEM-288) that expresses a membrane-stable CD40L (MEM40) and IFNβ. A phase 1 first-in-human dose
escalation clinical trial of single agent MEM-288 is nearing completion while a combination trial of MEM-288 with
ICI in NSCLC patients is expected to begin in Fall 2023. A primary goal of studies proposed here is to define
MEM-288 clinical activity in NSCLC patients from both trials and assess immune stimulatory effects of MEM-288
in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and ability to generate a systemic anti-tumor T cell response. Two Specific
Aims are proposed: Aim 1: Defining impact of in situ activation of CD40 and type 1 IFN signaling on DC and T
cell responses in tumor models. Aim 2: Impact of oncolytic virus (MEM-288) induced CD40 and type 1 IFN
signaling on TME remodeling and systemic T cell responses in NSCLC patients."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major health problem in the US and worldwide, causing high morbidity and mortality.
According to the CDC, in 2017, ~32.5 million had T2D, and an estimated 88 million adults in the United States
had prediabetes. Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death and has become the number one biomedical
financial burden in the US, with an estimated national economic cost of $327 billion in 2017. Currently, there is
no radical cure for T2D.
Studies have demonstrated that glucose induces insulin secretion in a biphasic pattern: an initial first-phase,
which develops rapidly but lasts only a few minutes, followed by a nadir, then a sustained second-phase. Loss
of first-phase insulin secretion and reduced second-phase secretion are characteristic features of T2D. It is well
known that a decrease in the first-phase insulin secretion is the earliest and detrimental defect detected in
impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes) and T2D. Although studies have highlighted the existence of two intra-
pancreatic axes of communication between the endocrine and exocrine pancreas (the insular–acinar axis and
the acinar–insular axis), little attention has been paid to any direct effect of the exocrine pancreas on β-cell
function. We recently designed a surgical mouse model wherein a pancreatic ductal infusion of 1% acetic acid
(AcA) led to complete ablation of the exocrine pancreas, but importantly with complete sparing of the islets. This
model allows us to study β-cell function in-situ in the pancreas, with the islets retaining their native innervation
and vasculature, but in the absence of the exocrine pancreas. We also established a genetic model that uses
the diphtheria toxin receptor selectively expressed in acinar cells via the elastase promoter to quickly ablate
acinar cells using diphtheria toxin. Our preliminary data in mice, and now in non-human primates, show a
significant improvement in glucose tolerance and first-phase insulin secretion to supranormal levels following
exocrine pancreas ablation. Observing a similar phenotype with both acinar-only ablation in the genetic model
and global exocrine (acini and ducts) ablation in the surgical model supports our hypothesis that it is the acinar
cells that are specifically detrimental to the β-cells.
This proposal aims to understand the improvements in the physiology of glucose homeostasis in this model by
performing the hyperglycemic clamp. It also aims to test the potential translatability of this study by examining
the effect of exocrine pancreas loss in a mouse model of obesity-induced hyperglycemia and identifying the
underlying causes of the improved insulin secretion following the loss of the exocrine tissue. Also, an important
aim of this study is to try to identify the acinar-secreted factor that has an adverse effect on β-cell function.
Successful completion of this project will provide the basis for the ultimate objective of this study of generating a
therapeutic target for T2D that can physiologically increase insulin secretion, particularly the first-phase, without
causing hypoglycemia."

Disruption of the molecular circadian clock is indicative of poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancers
(NSCLCs), but direct evidence for a causal link between circadian clock deregulation and malignancy in human
cancer is missing. We found that BMAL1 is downregulated in human NSCLCs, indicative of circadian
disruption, low BMAL1 is an indicator of aggressive disease and poor prognosis. In addition, deletion of
BMAL1 in a mouse model of NSCLC accelerates cancer progression. These data suggest that BMAL1, and by
extension, circadian rhythms, exert a tumor-suppressive role in lung cancer. However, how BMAL1 restrains
tumorigenesis and the mechanisms involved in suppression of BMAL1 remain unclear. A potential cause for
BMAL1 suppression is the upregulation of MYC-family oncoproteins, which are amplified 50% of NSCLCs. We
were the first to show that the molecular clock is disrupted by amplified MYC. In addition, our preliminary data
suggest that, even in the presence of glucocorticoids, MYC suppresses BMAL1 expression in both NSCLC and
normal lung epithelium, and thus disrupts circadian clock oscillation. To date, MYC amplification is the only
identifiable cause of this circadian disruption in NSCLC. While CLOCK-BMAL1, and thus, oscillation of the
molecular circadian clock, are necessary to maintain normal lung architecture and identity, we found that MYC
activation led to loss of normal lung alveolar epithelial identity and induction of inappropriate proliferation.
Notably, glucocorticoids have been shown to slow or halt the growth of some NSCLCs in preclinical and clinical
studies, and our preliminary data suggest that glucocorticoids fail to suppress proliferation of lung cells when
MYC is overexpressed. Taken together, we hypothesize that BMAL1 suppression and circadian disruption by
MYC in NSCLC is critical for loss of alveolar cell identity, the emergence of malignancy, and resistance to
glucocorticoids. To test this hypothesis, we propose two Aims. In our first Aim, we will interrogate the degree
to which MYC suppression of BMAL1 and disruption of the clock drive loss of lung alveolar cell identity and
malignant cell transformation. To test this, we will restore BMAL1 expression in MYC-amplified lung organoids,
mouse models. As part of this Aim, we will test the hypothesis that MYC prevents BMAL1 from binding its
typical DNA targets. We will also test the association between MYC, BMAL1, and malignancy in human tumor
samples. This will for the first time demonstrate that MYC disruption of the clock is critical in driving the earliest
stages of NSCLC development. In the second Aim, we will test the degree to which MYC and circadian
disruption suppress NSCLC response to glucocorticoids. We will determine, using in vitro and in vivo models
of NSCLC from mice and human patients, whether MYC overrides glucocorticoid-mediated growth suppression
via suppression of BMAL1. We will also determine the mechanism by which MYC controls the glucocorticoid
receptor and molecular clock response to glucocorticoids. Overall, these experiments will demonstrate that
BMAL1 is a tumor suppressive protein in NSCLC that is disabled by MYC to drive malignancy."

Down syndrome (DS), which is caused by full or partial trisomy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21),
presents various neurological features, including intellectual disability, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). Although some Hsa21 genes have been identified as key contributors to some of these diseases, the
pathogenetic mechanisms that link the triplication of HSA21 genes to most DS-related diseases remain
unknown. Particularly, very little is known about whether any of these diseases share common mechanisms.
For example, we do not know whether the increased risk for epilepsy and cognitive deficits share common
molecular and cellular basis. This is a major gap in our understanding and impedes the development of
effective treatments of DS-related diseases. Many of the DS-related neurological conditions are related to
dysregulated GABAergic systems. Previous studies by others and ours have shown that excessive
functions of GABAergic synapses impair synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and the cognitive
performances in DS mouse models. On the other hand, dysregulated GABAergic systems are also a major
contributor to epilepsy. These results indicated that GABAergic dysfunction and altered connectivity might
be key to the comorbidity of cognitive deficits and epilepsy in DS. Recently, we found that the triplication of
Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) is a major cause of the increased GABAergic synapses
and enhanced GABAergic synaptic transmission in the neocortex of DS mouse models. DSCAM variants
are strongly associated with cognitive abilities, raising the possibility that DSCAM contributes to the
comorbidity of DS diseases that are caused by dysregulated GABAergic systems. The objective of the
proposed study is to identify molecular regulators of GABAergic systems that underlie comorbidities in DS.
The central hypothesis is that DSCAM triplication enhances GABAergic synaptic transmission by increasing
GABAergic synaptogenesis and contributes to the comorbidity of cognitive deficits and epilepsy in DS. The
collaborative team has complementary strengths and is in a unique position for the proposed study. The
proposed research is innovative because it will (1) identify a novel molecular mechanism that underlies the
comorbidity of cognitive deficits and epilepsy in DS; (2) provide the first complete characterization of the
activity dynamics of cell-type specific populations of the DS hippocampus in vivo; (3) apply cutting-edge
spatial transcriptomic techniques to provide a unique transcriptomic profile with spatial resolution in a DS
mouse model. This research is significant because its successful completion will identify the molecular
regulators of the GABAergic system in the DS hippocampus and discover them as common contributors to
the comorbidities between epilepsy and intellectual disability in DS. This knowledge will offer insights into
the development of therapeutic treatments that target these DS-related conditions. The knowledge will also
provide insights into other neurological disorders."

 Neutrophils are a key drivers of immune mediated reperfusion injury in the heart after ischemia-reperfusion
(MI/R). They rapidly infiltrate the heart within minutes, directly cause damage through effector functions, and
dictate subsequent inflammatory events through environmental alterations, cytokine release, and interactions
with other immune cells. We performed single cell RNA sequencing on cardiac-infiltrating neutrophils to
uncover the diversity in neutrophil populations as well as novel pathways. We identified neutrophils with a type
I interferon (IFN-I) signature, a pathway traditionally associated with host viral defense. The role of IFN-I in
cardiac neutrophils is unknown. In preliminary experiments, we document that inhibiting the IFN-I pathway
during the peak of neutrophil activation in the first 24 hours after MI/R improves cardiac recovery. We also
found that cardiac infiltrating neutrophils express IFN-I and have upregulated interferon sensitive genes (ISGs)
suggesting they may both produce and respond to IFN-I.
 In order to precisely study this pathway, we have made two unique mice strains lacking the ‘stimulator of
interferon gene response’ (STING) or the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR1) only in neutrophils. STING is a
key activator of IFN-I transcription and IFNAR1 is the receptor for IFN-I. In this proposal we will first explore
the effects of IFN-I on neutrophil biology using human neutrophils in ex vivo assays, as well as mouse in vivo
studies. Next, we will subject neutrophil-specific STING knock out mice to MI/R and precisely characterize
changes to acute inflammatory events, sub-acute, and chronic inflammatory events, and cardiac recovery.
Inflammatory events such as immune cell phenotypes, local and systemic cytokines, and neutrophil function
will be precisely characterized. Lastly, we will explore the same endpoints in mice lacking the ability to detect
IFN-I due to neutrophil specific IFNAR1 knockout. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is as follows:
Neutrophil initiation of and response to IFN-I are key early drivers of neutrophilic inflammation and set off
detrimental inflammatory cascades culminating in impaired cardiac function after MI/R.
 If correct, an IFN-I targeted therapy administered during neutrophilic inflammation early after MI/R may
improve recovery and be a clinically feasible intervention. An IFN-I antagonist has recently been approved as a
treatment for lupus and could be repurposed for this indication. Treatment for only 24 hours would be required
to fully cover the timeframe of neutrophilic inflammation but could greatly influence downstream inflammation
and optimize the heart for maximal recovery."

Abstract
The goal of community engagement within the National Resource for Translational and Developmental
Proteomics (NRTDP) is to promulgate the research developed within the Resource and enable scientists across
the nation to perform top-down proteomics (TDP) in a robust and reproducible way. We understand that there
are still impediments to the wide-scale adoption of top-down, proteoform-resolved measurements. Through
Community Engagement, coupled with TR&D 5, 6 and 7, presented in this renewal, we aim to break down
those barriers where they exist and develop and export the methods and techniques that will bring wide-spread
adoption of TDP.
In the initial application, Community Engagement was split into three separate sections: Collaboration
and Service (CS), Training, and Dissemination. We feel that these distinctions are still valuable and for this
renewal, we retain each of these sections as specific aims within the Community Engagement section.
Specific Aim 1 (Collaboration and Service). Here we provide NRTDP users direct access to TDP, performed
by our scientists within the NRTDP. We do so in two subaims, developing robust service lines focused on
targeted top-down proteomics and quantitative label-free top-down proteomics (TDQ).
Specific Aim 2 (Training). In this aim, we provide direct, hands-on education in TDP. We have proposed two
methodologies: a quarterly, top-down proteomics course and our NRTDP Scholar Exchange Program.
Specific Aim 3 (Dissemination). Finally, we aim to provide enduring resources for top-down proteomics through
the NRTDP by providing tools that can be easily accessed and reused for years to come. We will do so through
software that we develop as well as publishing robust, standardized methods and protocols."

Traditionally, researchers have been trained in either neuroscience or immunology, whereas the
Neuroimmunology Training Program (NITP) at the University of California, Irvine seeks to develop and train the
next generation of researchers in both fields with a cross-disciplinary approach focused on the interplay between
the immune and nervous systems during disease. This application requests support for 4 pre-doctoral trainees
who will be selected from an outstanding pool of candidates within our relevant graduate programs. Moreover,
UCI has a diverse graduate student population and expects at least 50% of trainees supported with NIH funding
will be underrepresented minorities in the biomedical sciences. This application is the result of ongoing
collaborations between high-caliber faculty on campus who recognized the need to develop a training program
specific to the challenges of neuroimmunology. The NITP will formally bring together 24 faculty members from
across the neuroimmunology research spectrum to participate in mentorship and program-wide activities to
share expertise and further develop the neuroimmunology field. The training program will be overseen by two
faculty directors and an advisory committee focused on selecting and supporting trainees who are highly likely
to exhibit continued success within the diverse field of neuroimmunology research. The NITP program directors
will initiate programming at UCI to enhance the quality of research and mentoring experiences of trainees and
set them up for career success. All in all, UCI’s NITP proposal demonstrates the exceptional training record of
our faculty mentors, unique resources to support research, and robust institutional support. From this strong
foundation, the NITP will provide an outstanding opportunity for trainees to develop intellectually, advance and
optimize their thesis research projects, create a valuable network of colleagues, and prepare for a highly
successful research career focused on the crossroads of immunology and neuroscience."
10877477,"The human fungal pathogen C. albicans causes life-threatening systemic infections and severe
morbidity from mucosal infections. Morphology switching between budding and filamentous growth
is central to C. albicans pathogenesis. The transition to hyphal growth makes C. albicans a more
aggressive pathogen that can infect a broad range of host niches by crossing epithelial and
endothelial barriers and growing invasively into tissues. However, most previous research has
focused on identifying upstream regulators and genes that promote hyphal growth in liquid culture,
which are often not important in vivo. Therefore, little is known about the mechanisms that directly
promote invasive growth of C. albicans in the host. To address this gap, a genetic screen was
used to identify mutants that are strongly defective in invasive growth. The proposed studies will
focus on three sets of these mutants that revealed new mechanisms that are critical for invasion.
Aim 1 will focus on mutants that identified an important role for endocytosis in invasive growth in
vitro and in vivo. These studies are expected to reveal which stages of endocytosis are important
and how they promote plasma membrane organization that is needed for invasive growth. Aim 2
will focus on two other newly discovered functions that mediate novel mechanisms for invasion.
One new function is carried out by Pxl1, which is similar to paxillin proteins that bind stressed actin
filaments to mediate mechano-sensing in mammalian cells. The pxl1D mutant will be investigated
to determine how it plays a role in sensing the surrounding matrix and mediating invasive growth.
The other new function needed for invasive growth involves pathways that regulate trafficking of v-
SNAREs, which are needed for secretion. Defining the role of these trafficking pathways will be
significant because polarized secretion is fundamentally important for hyphal growth. The new
mechanisms will be tested in mouse models of oropharyngeal candidiasis and bloodstream-
disseminated candidiasis to determine how invasive growth is regulated at these very different
sites. Identifying the mechanisms that promote C. albicans invasive growth will create new
avenues for the development of therapeutic approaches."

Our proposed research is expected to identify genetic factors that underlie disordered sleep associated with
Alzheimer's disease (AD), and determine if they are intervenable to stave off cognitive symptoms. Detection
and validation of these genes will promote possible treatments through discovery of new targets and biological
pathways that may aid in alleviating disease burden and improving quality of life in humans. The data
generated in this proposal will also be cross-checked with available datasets from human cohorts and
postmortem samples, such that advances in our current understanding of the networks and mechanisms in
mice can be understood in the context of human AD. We will leverage advanced mouse models to
identify
molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the bidirectional relationship between AD pathology and
disruptions in sleep. In Aim 1, we will identify genes and molecular networks associated with sleep loss in a
large population of AD mice that better model human AD. In Aim 2, we will translate genes and networks
underlying variation in sleep loss to human AD cohorts. Finally, in Aim 3, we will validate genetic and
modifiable factors associated with sleep loss and dysfunction, and determine their effects on onset and
progression of memory deficits in powerful AD models."
10877216,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Epilepsy, a condition characterized by chronic, spontaneous seizures, is the fourth most common neurological
disorder, affecting nearly 1 in 27 individuals in the United States. In addition to the seizures themselves, chronic
epilepsy is associated with cognitive deficits, structural changes, and devastating negative outcomes. For as
many as half of all epilepsy patients, seizures are not controlled with current treatment options. There is an
urgent need to uncover how chronic epilepsy impacts overall function as well as advance new avenues for
therapeutic intervention. Despite not being traditionally associated with epilepsy, the cerebellum is emerging
as a potentially critical node in the seizure network; cerebellar structural alterations in epilepsy are associated
with comorbidities and negative outcomes, and interventions targeting the cerebellum can powerfully attenuate
hippocampal seizures in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. This bi-directional influence of seizures on
the cerebellum and vice versa clearly outline the cerebellum area as a potentially key player in epilepsy, whose
yet unknown exact role carries major implications for patients. This proposal leverages a novel technique for
mesoscale imaging of the cerebellar cortex to probe how diverse seizure networks alter cerebellar activity, as
well as determine whether targeting cerebellar outputs can attenuate seizures arising in structures beyond the
hippocampus. By uncovering how the cerebellum interacts with different seizure foci, we will not only gain
critical insight into the impact of seizures and chronic epilepsy on cerebellar function, but also potentially
uncover new targets for therapeutic modulation in the treatment of different epilepsies.
My overarching research interest is to understand computations performed by the cerebellar cortex and how
they contribute to healthy behavior and disease. My career goals include becoming an independent researcher
studying cerebellar network dynamics and interactions with forebrain structures during motor and non-motor
behavior, as well as epilepsy and seizures. My previous training background has given me a solid foundation
in electrophysiological recordings, behavioral analyses, optogenetic manipulations, and the implementation of
rodent models of epilepsy. However, to fully realize my independent research goals, the training outlined in this
K99 will equip me with new skills in experimental techniques and analysis strategies to characterize cellular
and network dynamics using calcium imaging. In addition to new technical expertise, this K99 will provide me
with a broadened scientific network, improved laboratory management skills, and augmented grant writing
expertise. Combined with my prior experience, the additional training and expertise provided by this K99
provides key additions that will help me establish a successful, independent laboratory incorporating innovative,
cutting edge research techniques to explore cerebellar computations and their specific contributions to healthy
behavior and disease."
10876781,"Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and disability. Exercise is a first-line component of care for
knee OA. However, the majority of individuals with knee OA are inactive, and exercise-based physical therapy
(PT) is underutilized across health care systems. There are no established processes or pathways for
systematically integrating exercise-based therapies into clinical care for knee OA; this is a major contributor to
underutilization. We recently developed and tested a STepped Exercise Program for Knee OA (STEP-KOA) as
a systematic approach to delivering exercise-based therapies. STEP-KOA begins with a home-based exercise
program, supported by evidence-based and behaviorally informed tools (Step 1). After 3 months, patients are
evaluated for clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function; patients not meeting criteria for
improvement “step up” to telephone-based coaching (Step 2). After an additional 3 months, patients still not
meeting criteria for clinically relevant improvement progress to PT visits (Step 3). Patient-centeredness and
efficiency are hallmarks of STEP-KOA, as the interventions are based on patient needs and improvement, and
the more resource-intensive interventions (particularly PT) are reserved for later stages. In our randomized
controlled trial conducted within the Department of Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, STEP-KOA resulted in
significant improvements in self-reported pain and function compared with an Arthritis Education control group.
We are preparing to conduct a multi-site hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial
(RCT) that will take important steps toward enhancing and implementing STEP-KOA in different health
systems. We will add physical activity monitoring, behavioral messaging and tailored exercise prescriptions
(that emphasize progression to ensure a sufficient training response) to STEP-KOA. We specifically plan for a
2-site RCT in which individuals with symptomatic knee OA are randomized to STEP-KOA or a usual care / wait
list control group., with outcomes collected at baseline, 9 months (end of intervention period) and 15 months
(6-month maintenance period). In this planning period, we will: 1) Finalize the scientific details and
intervention tools for the multi-site STEP-KOA RCT; this will include enhancing the STEP-KOA patient tools
to incorporate the new components, refining tools for STEP-KOA coaches and physical therapists, finalizing
training materials and fidelity assessment plans, establishing procedures for telehealth delivery of PT visits,
finalizing assessment plans, and establishing the randomization scheme and statistical analysis plan. 2)
Finalize the logistical and practical aspects of the multi-site STEP-KOA RCT; this will include identifying
referring clinics and PT clinics, addressing regulatory and logistical details, building the study database and
developing data management plans, finalizing recruitment and enrollment processes, finalizing the trial budget
and preparing the protocol, manual of operating procedures and study timeline. The proposed planning period
will ensure our team is prepared to conduct a rigorous and efficient multi-site RCT of STEP-KOA."

The success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in solid tumors requires antigen targets with no
on-target, off-tumor toxicity, effective tumor infiltration, cytotoxicity and proliferation in an immunosuppressive
environment, and revival of antigen stress-induced exhausted CAR T cells. We translated CD28-costimulated
CARs (M28z) that target mesothelin (MSLN), a cancer-associated antigen that we have documented
expression in majority of solid tumors; 64 patients have been treated to date, with no on-target, off-tumor
toxicity. Having demonstrated that regionally administered CAR T cells avoid pulmonary sequestration and
benefit from early antigen-activated CD4 helper CAR T-cell function, we delivered CAR T cells intrapleurally in
patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), promoting tumor infiltration. To address T-cell
exhaustion, we either treated patients with anti-PD1 agent after CAR T cells or employed tumor-specific
checkpoint blockade by CAR T-cell intrinsic PD1 dominant negative receptor (PD1DNR); 34 patients have
been treated to date, with no CAR- or PD1DNR-related toxicities and with responses by imaging, and
increased survival. To promote IFNγ-mediated cytotoxicity shown to be essential for solid tumor killing, we
exploited a c-KIT mutation, D816V (KITv), as a costimulatory domain. KITv CAR T cells show antigen-
activation induced IFNγ signaling, enhanced cytotoxicity, and when added as signal 3 to CD28 (signal 2),
provide a synergistic function, resist TGFβ-mediated suppression, and prolong functional persistence.
Clinically available kinase inhibitors provide an on/off, tunable safety switch for KITv CAR T cells. To effectively
deliver these next-generation CAR T cells to solid tumors, we developed a translational strategy of non-
ablative, tumor-targeted radiation therapy (RT) to generate a chemokine gradient that facilitates systemically
administered CAR T-cell chemotaxis, tumor infiltration, proliferation, and persistence. Herein, we seek to
translate the M28zKITv-PD1DNR CAR T cells to address key limitations in solid tumor cell therapy. In UG3
phase, we will explore the hypothesis that PD1DNR checkpoint blockade extends beyond tumor cells and
counteracts PDL1-expressing M2 macrophages with immune suppressor function (Aim 1). We will define
optimal regimen of non-ablative, tumor-targeted RT to promote tumor infiltration of systemically administered
CAR T cells, achieving efficacy similar to that with regional delivery. In Aim 3, we will submit an IND
application, a process with which we are familiar and have track record of success. In UH3 phase, we will
conduct a phase I study to investigate the safety, functional activity and efficacy, and markers of response in
patients with MPM. The significance of our approach lies in its effective combination of solid tumor-specific–
scFv that is on-target and safe (MSLN), costimulatory domains (CD28, KITv), checkpoint blockade (PD1DNR),
and a strategy of promoting solid tumor-infiltration (RT) of CAR T cells. The impact of our proposal extends
beyond MPM (>150,000/year pleural cancers in the U.S.); majority of aggressive solid tumors express MSLN."

The Model Systems Core (MSC) will leverage the institutional strengths of Washington University School
of Medicine (WUSM) in genetics, neuroscience, bioinformatics and neuroimaging to address key
questions on the causes and treatments of IDD with particular reference to genetic abnormalities and
environmental factors. The MSC will be organized into two units – the Cellular Models Unit (CMU) and
the Animal Assessments Unit (AAU), the latter being composed of three subunits including Animal
Behavior, Neuropathology, and Neurophysiology. Through its team of interactive scientists, the MSC will
pursue its specific aims by providing seamless expertise, resources, and assessments to committed
WUSM investigators for the purpose of: (1) promoting the discovery of the basic molecular and cellular
pathways shared by diverse causes of IDD; (2) determining the neural signatures associated with IDD at
the neural circuit level and whole brain; (3) characterizing core neurobehavioral features of IDD and
clarifying their causal origins; and (4) developing interventions to ameliorate the effects of genetic or
environmental insults on the developing brain. To achieve these goals, the MSC will use an integrated
model systems approach to synergize the strengths of its own units as well as those of the Clinical
Translational Core and the Developmental Neuroimaging Core. Additional aims for each unit will also be
operative. For example, reprogrammed somatic cell models of human disorders provide fundamental
insights into biological pathways as well as disease processes; therefore, the MSC will now offer
renewable patient-derived human IDD cellular models to link genetic alterations with disease
mechanisms and phenotype via the CMU. The MSC will also continue to provide consultation and
comprehensive assessment of brain structure, pathology, physiology and behavior of IDD animal models
through the AAU. Reaching across cores, the CMU will work closely with the Clinical Translation Core’s
human genomic characterization unit to develop IDD patient registries that will be directly used as a
recruitment source for derivation of patient-derived cellular models. Similarly, the AAU depends upon the
Developmental Neuroimaging Core for imaging relevant preclinical models to investigate mechanisms
underlying developmental pathology potentially providing a bridge to clinical studies. Using these
strategies, the overarching mission of the MSC is to identify new treatments, biomarkers and/or
interventions that can prevent or reduce the impact of IDD-linked diseases. As more genomic data
becomes available and WU investigators capitalize on this information, another critical role for the MSC
will be the integration of new and existing information across the IDDRC@WUSTL cores and other
existing facilities within the University."

Perinatal mental health conditions are the most common complication of pregnancy and childbirth (1 in 8
women). When left untreated, perinatal depression and anxiety adversely affects the entire family. Significant
racial/ethnic, rural/urban, and socioeconomic status disparities exist in the diagnosis and treatment of perinatal
depression and anxiety and these inequities are often intersectional. Our previous and extensive work with
multilevel stakeholders including well-established community advisory boards, underrepresented and minority
birthing people in rural geographies, and state departments of public health demonstrates the importance of
social support as a mechanism for reducing disparities in perinatal depression, particularly in rural
geographies. Home visiting programs (HVPs) can provide the social support needed to improve mental health
outcomes in pregnant and postpartum women. Despite the known benefits of HVPs and the high rates of
moderate to severe depressive symptoms among HVP recipients, home visitors report that clients with
depression are more difficult to engage; a specific need exists to address perinatal mental health in HVPs.
Mothers and Babies, trialed in HVPs by our co-investigator, is an evidence-based cognitive behavioral
intervention that has been shown to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms, but barriers remain for
maximizing adoption and fidelity within HVPs. Using an evidence-based implementation strategy that tailors
implementation delivery to the needs of the specific populations and context may improve fidelity and adoption,
particularly in rural states where residents have limited access to care. Our long-term goal is to improve uptake
of an evidence-based maternal mental health intervention to reduce disparities in adverse maternal outcomes
and improve community health. The objectives of our study are: Aim 1: Adapt implementation facilitation to
support uptake of Mothers and Babies using stakeholder input; Aim 2: Analyze the effects of the adapted
facilitation on implementation outcomes (i.e., adoption and fidelity) using mixed rapid ethnographic methods;
and Aim 3: Determine the effect of adapted facilitation on the clinical outcomes of severity of depressive
symptoms and perceived stress. We will conduct a hybrid implementation-effectiveness-context cluster
randomized control trial to test the adapted facilitation strategy compared with implementation as usual (i.e.,
standard education) and will examine the mechanisms of change (i.e., contextual determinants) related to
outcomes. The immediate impact of this research will be to show whether adapted facilitation can improve the
uptake and fidelity of a maternal mental health intervention like Mothers and Babies across multiple HVP
models and thus positively affect depressive symptoms and perceived stress of recipients. Further, our
implementation protocol can be used by other states to better integrate other maternal mental health
interventions into HVPs, leading to further improvements in maternal mental health and further reductions in
adverse outcomes for mothers, children, and families."
10881521,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Congenital hydrocephalus (CH) is the leading cause for brain surgery and is associated with marked
neurodevelopmental disability. CH is traditionally considered a primary disorder of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
homeostasis and thereby treated with surgical CSF shunting or endoscopic third ventriculostomy procedures to
reduce CSF accumulation. One glaring concern is that ventriculomegaly often persists even after surgical
intervention, and shunting does not consistently improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in many CH patients.
While extensive research has identified new CH risk genes and highlighted their convergence in embryonic
neuroepithelial stem cells, the causes of approximately 80% of CH cases remain unknown. This is partly due to
genetic heterogeneity, reduced penetrance, and small sample sizes. Of note, non-European populations have
been significantly underrepresented in existing genetic studies. Moreover, the impact of non-coding variants,
structural variants, and somatic variants on CH mechanism remains largely uncharacterized. Additionally, the
significant clinical variability observed among different subtypes of hydrocephalus has not been thoroughly
evaluated at the molecular, cellular, and neuroimaging levels. Therefore, our objective is to establish a large
and diverse cohort of primary CH patients, with a particular focus on non-European populations. Leveraging
our expertise in genomics, neuroscience, neuroimaging, and pediatric neurology, we will enhance patient
recruitment, generate and harmonize genomic and clinical data, and use WashU’s Central Neuroimaging Data
Archive to automate quality control and image processing. This will create the largest CH cohort to date with
whole-exome sequencing (WES; n = 2,879 [2,697 trios]) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS; n = 1,020 [648
trios]) data linked with comprehensive phenotypic and neuroimaging information to identify any remaining
germline variants associated with CH. We will also perform integrative analyses of WES, WGS, transcriptomic
data, and protein-protein interaction networks to uncover additional CH risk genes, pathways, and disease-
associated cell types. To characterize somatic variants, we will conduct 500X WES on unaffected and affected
brain tissues from approximately 100 patients and study their effects on gene expression and transcript
splicing using bulk RNA-sequencing. Furthermore, to enhance diagnostic accuracy and establish a clinical and
neuroimaging signature for CH, we will reevaluate neuroimaging, clinical, and genomic data and analyze
genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in known and
candidate genes associated with CH. To investigate factors influencing clinical variability, we will compare
patients with CH and P/LP variants to controls without CH but with P/LP variants in the same genes. To
facilitate data sharing, visualization, and analysis, we will establish the HYDRO-Seq Genome Browser and
integrate it with the WashU Epigenome Browser. Together, this work will provide a comprehensive
characterization of genomic, clinical, and neuroimaging variations in CH."

One out of seven women suffer from chronic pelvic pain, a syndrome leading to depression, social isolation,
sexual dysfunction, physical inactivity, and progressive pain-related disability. Unfortunately, few clinical
treatments for chronic pelvic pain are supported by rigorous evidence of efficacy, and most have limitations
that decrease their safety or accessibility for many women in the community. Women with chronic pelvic pain
also have high rates of exposure to sexual and interpersonal trauma, which can complicate their engagement
with clinical treatments. As a result, many women are anxious to identify alternate management strategies for
pelvic pain that are not only effective but better tolerated, more patient-centered, and more accessible.
Yoga is a set of complementary physical and mental practices with the potential to improve pelvic pain in
women through multiple mechanisms. When practiced in a way that emphasizes careful practice of yoga
postures, mindful awareness of body structures (such as the pelvic floor), deep breathing and relaxation
techniques, and trauma-informed care principles, yoga can be used to help women improve pelvic floor
dysfunction, correct maladaptive postural and physical behaviors, decrease comorbid anxiety and perceived
stress, and overcome deconditioning associated with chronic pain. Furthermore, yoga as a complementary
treatment modality does not require intensive supervision by clinician specialists or repeated visits to
healthcare facilities. With the rise of videoconference-based yoga instruction, women do not even need to
travel back and forth to brick-and mortar yoga studios, but instead gain access to specialized yoga instruction,
maintain regular yoga practice, and interact with others with the same indication from their own homes.
To evaluate the feasibility of pelvic yoga as a complementary management strategy for women with chronic
pelvic pain, our team collaborated with an expert yoga panel to develop and refine a structured pelvic yoga
program grounded in a biophysiological model of female chronic pelvic pain. In a randomized feasibility trial,
women with chronic pelvic pain recruited from multiple locations in California were randomly assigned to a
study yoga program consisting of twice-weekly group classes conducted by videoconference supplemented by
once weekly individual practice, or a control program of time-equivalent group instruction and individual
practice of non-specific muscle stretching and strengthening exercises. Following the successful completion of
this pilot, we now propose to conduct a full-scale, fully remote trial in women recruited nationally, to rigorously
evaluate the efficacy of remotely delivered pelvic yoga and to explore potential mediators of treatment benefit.
This research is designed to provide rigorous evidence of the efficacy and safety of a remotely delivered pelvic
yoga program as a potentially patient-centered, scalable, community-based self-management strategy for
chronic pelvic pain, as one of the most burdensome, complex, and common pain syndromes in women."

 Exposure to social disadvantage is the most salient determinant of population health disparities. Although sub-
stantial progress had been made in understanding how social disadvantage becomes biologically embedded, crucial
knowledge gaps remain. Biological embedding has been described primarily at the level of differentiated cell types and
tissues. Based on the consideration that a) social disadvantage’s long-term effects extend well beyond the lifespan of
differentiated cells, whose replenishment occurs only from stem/progenitor cells, and b) can be perpetuated across
generations, we advance the novel hypothesis that the origins of health disparities may extend all the way down to the level
of stem cells, and specifically to the effects of maternal social disadvantage exposure on offspring stem cells during
embryonic/fetal life. Our proposed study will focus on disparities between Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic
White mothers and their newborns in obesity and metabolic phenotypes; on mesenchymal progenitor/stromal cells (MSCs) and MSC-
derived adipocytes as the stem and differentiated cells of interest; on mitochondrial function, adipogenic propensity/activity and
insulin sensitivity as the key intracellular processes of importance; on newborn adipose tissue mass and glucose-insulin regulation
as the outcomes of significance; and on maternal-fetal gestational biology as the proximate transmission pathway. We will
conduct this study in a cohort of N=240 child-mother dyads; isolate and culture fetal MSCs from newborn cord
tissue; perform high-resolution cellular experiments; and characterize neonatal phenotypes in vitro in MSC-derived
adipoctyes, and in vivo using whole body densitometry. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that maternal exposure to social
disadvantage is associated with newborn mesenchymal stem cell characteristics, i.e., reduced mitochondrial efficiency,
increased adipogenic propensity, and reduced insulin sensitivity. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that variation in ma-
ternal and fetal gestational biology (composite measures of endocrine, immune/inflammatory, and metabolic ligands)
mediates the effects of social disadvantage on newborn mesenchymal stem cells. Aim 3 will establish the clinical
significance of variation in MSC characteristics for neonatal obesity-related phenotypes at the a) cellular level (MSC-
derived adipocyte size and fat content; mitochondrial function; adipogenic activity), and b) whole-body level (percent
fat mass and systemic insulin sensitivity). Aim 4 (exploratory) will elucidate potentially modifiable maternal psychosocial
and behavioral factors that relate to the specific components of social disadvantage that are associated with new-
born MSC biology. Aim 5 will establish a shared repository (biobank) of MSC, cord blood, cord and placental tissue
samples for future studies of molecular mechanisms (gene expression profiles, epigenetic characteristics) and in vitro cell
differentiation analyses. Significance and impact: 1) Our study will define novel measures (with norms) in human
newborn stem cells that profile the earliest vulnerabilities for health and population health disparities; 2) broaden
understanding of novel cellular targets and molecular mechanisms underlying biological embedding of social disad-
vantage, that, in turn, may inform risk identification, prevention, early diagnosis, and personalized intervention; and
3) provide a unique and valuable shared resource (human newborn stem cell culture biobank)."
10871965,"The Overall Objectives of this proposal are to define the mechanism of liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) endotheliopathy and its pathogenic role in portal hypertension and liver inflammation in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). MASH pathogenesis involves both lipotoxicity (toxic lipid-induced cellular stress) and sterile inflammatory responses. Lipotoxicity in LSEC triggers aberrant signaling, resulting in LSEC dysfunction and a proinflammatory phenotype, which we refer to as endotheliopathy. Emerging data implicate LSEC endotheliopathy in liver inflammation. Furthermore, LSEC dysfunction leading to subclinical portal hypertension in non-cirrhotic MASH patients has been recognized as a driver of liver fibrosis\o ""Baffy, 2022 #36"". However, the molecular mediators of LSEC endotheliopathy and functional consequences in MASH are largely unknown. We identified glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3β as the top kinase in LSEC phosphoproteomics and focal adhesion and transendothelial migration (TEM) as the major pathways of multiomics integration on LSECs from mice with MASH. Our preliminary data indicate that during lipotoxicity: 1) GSK3β phosphorylates myosin light chain 2, generating contractile stress fibers and increasing cellular stiffness, thereby augmenting vascular resistance; 2) GSK3β increases the LSEC expression of the adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) and enhances myeloid cell adhesion and TEM; 3) pharmacological GSK3 inhibition reduces liver inflammation and fibrosis, and endothelial cell-specific Gsk3β deletion reduces portal pressure in mice with diet-induced MASH. Based on these novel observations, we formulated the CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS that lipotoxicity-induced GSK3β activation in LSEC increases vascular resistance and mediates TEM of myeloid cells, thereby promoting portal hypertension and liver inflammation in MASH. The proposal will test this hypothesis and provide insights into two independent and integrated specific aims. First, we will study the in vitro mechanism and functional outcome of GSK3β-mediated LSEC cytoskeletal rearrangement and increased cellular stiffness. Using mice with diet induced MASH, and a novel GSK3 inhibitor, or mice with conditional deletion of Gsk3β in endothelial cells, we will define the LSEC vs hepatocyte specific role of GSK3β in MASH, and the potential for therapeutic targeting. Second, we will define the mechanism and functional outcome of GSK3β-mediated ICAM1 transcriptional upregulation and the therapeutic potential of ICAM1 pharmacological inhibition and endotjelial cell genetic repression in mouse models of MASH. We will then validate the human relevance of LSEC endotheliopathy and myeloid cells TEM in MASH by spatial transcriptomics."
10873724,"Project Summary
Squamous cell lung cancer, a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is the second most common type
of lung cancer. Also known as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung, SCC is responsible for ~85,000 new
cases of lung cancer each year and ~50,000 deaths in the United States alone. SCC is distinct from the other
major subtype of NSCLC (adenocarcinoma) in terms of its histology, biomarker expression, genomic alterations,
immune microenvironment and response to therapy. SCC has limited therapeutic options that are confined to
chemotherapy and more recently, immunotherapy, which is only effective in a subset of patients. A major unmet
need for the treatment of SCC is the identification of new therapeutic targets and treatment strategies to combat
this disease. SCC has a unique histopathology and a complex microenvironment that is rich with desmoplastic
stroma, keratinization and immune cells. Specifically, tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) are enriched in
mouse and human SCC, and neutrophil abundance correlates with poor prognosis and poor response to
immunotherapy. Relatively little is known about how TANs impact SCC tumor progression and therapeutic
response. It is notoriously difficult to model SCC in cell culture, which lacks the three-dimensional architecture
of tumors, an intact immune system, and vasculature. Genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) provide
a complex living system that can highly recapitulate the human disease. Our laboratory pioneered the
development of the first SOX2-driven SCC GEMM. We recently developed a rapid new GEMM based on
alterations in Sox2/Lkb1/Nkx2-1 (SNL) where SCC tumors highly resemble the human disease in terms of
histopathology, genetics, and immune microenvironment. This new SNL model represents a unique immune-
competent tool to investigate how TANs shape tumor progression and therapeutic response. The objective of
this study is to elucidate the role of TANs in squamous lung cancer development, progression and response to
therapy. We hypothesize that TANs promote squamous cell fate by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS),
which are implicated in tumor transdifferentiation, and by promoting neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis). To
test these hypotheses, we will: 1) Determine the mechanism by which TANs alter tumor cell fate. 2) Determine
whether TANs promote squamous lung cancer progression via ROS and/or NETosis. 3) Determine whether
neutrophil depletion enhances response to chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. This approach is innovative
because we will employ: 1) our novel immune-competent SCC GEMM that recapitulates key features of the
human disease, 2) neutrophil depletion strategies that are in clinical trials, and 3) state-of-the-art technologies
including single cell RNA-sequencing and natural cancer-associated inhibitors of NETosis. This research is
significant because TAN function in SCC is almost completely unexplored and TANs may represent a new
therapeutic target for this intractable disease."

cells, atherosclerosis and other tissues studied within the Program Project will substantially enhance the
scientific progress of the four individual projects."
10874525,"Diabetes is associated with greater cardiovascular disease (CVD), likely due at least in part to increased
circulating levels of atherogenic lipoproteins. The most common dyslipidemia in patients with diabetes,
especially Type 2 diabetes, is hypertriglyceridemia (hyperTG). Moreover, recent human data also implicate
genes associated with hyperTG such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL), apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3), and
angiopoietin-like protein (ANGPTL)3 with CVD. Despite more than 4 decades of investigation, a mechanistic
understanding of the relationship of hyperTG and CVD has not been clearly defined. Project 3 of this Program
Project proposes to develop and use new animal models to assess how hyperTG and diabetes interact to alter
vascular pathobiology. Our studies will focus on changes in arterial LPL using models that increase and
decrease lipolysis within and likely along the arterial wall. Monocyte/macrophages are the only white blood
cells that highly express LPL and they are the primary source of vascular LPL. Using single cell RNA
sequencing, we have found that arterial macrophages have a cluster of high LPL expressing cells and our
studies will uncover how LPL itself and LPL in the presence of hyperTG and diabetes alter cells in this and the
other clusters. This Project has two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine how hyperTG and local lipolysis affect
vascular disease. To do this, we will transplant bone marrow from mice that have an inducible deletion of either
LPL (to reduce lipolysis) or ANGPTL4 (to increased LPL activity) into animals that have either normal or
increased circulating levels of triglyceride (TGs) due to induced global deletion of LPL. Both atherogenesis and
regression will be studied using a novel method we developed to delete and then replenish LDL receptors. In
addition, we will test whether changing the composition of circulating TGs by feeding mice an omega 3 fatty
acid-rich diet, recently shown to reduce CVD risk, will modify the vascular effects of altering macrophage LPL
expression or levels of remnant lipoprotein particles. Aim 2 will test how changes in hyperglycemia/insulin
actions and altered lipolysis products affect atherosclerosis regression, endothelial cell lipid accumulation and
gene expression. We will create models with insulin deficiency and defective insulin sensitivity due to high fat
diets. We were the first to show that defective regression is a robust vascular disease manifestation of
diabetes. These studies will involve extensive interactions with the other projects of this Program and use of
Cores B and C."
10874527,"Our research program aims to identify modifiable factors that promote atherogenesis by increasing levels of
atherogenic lipoproteins and/or by impairing HDL’s ability to remove cholesterol from artery wall macrophages.
In contrast to most investigators, we first identify proteins and lipoproteins that predict cardiovascular disease
risk (CVD) risk in humans and then perform mechanistic studies in mice based on those results. A major
component of this approach has been to devise high-throughput state-of-the-art analytical methods for use in
clinical studies. We have a particular interest in diabetic atherosclerotic disease because there are no well-
established lipoprotein risk factors in type 1 diabetic patients (T1DM) and because type 2 diabetic patients
(T2DM) treated with statins still have a substantial risk for CVD.
Our compelling preliminary data suggest that small HDL particles altered by the diabetic milieu strongly predict
future CVD events in healthy T1DM patients (n=181, P=0.0008). In parallel, we isolated HDL from 19 T2DM
subjects and 20 control subjects and showed that small HDL’s cholesterol efflux capacitya proposed metric
of HDL’s cardioprotective effectswas markedly impaired in the T2DM subjects. These observations point
to two specific defects in HDL of T1DM and T2DM patients—size and inability to remove cholesterol
from the artery wall—that may increase CVD risk. The demonstration that small HDL particles are markedly
elevated in healthy T1DM patients who subsequently experience CVD events contradicts the dogma that high
levels of HDL are always cardioprotective. A major goal of this proposal is to identify the mechanisms
underlying the association of small HDL with CVD. First, we propose to confirm and extend our findings in
two large clinical studies of T1DM and T2DM subjects. We also plan to explore the hypothesis that lipolysis of
triglyceride-rich lipoproteins couples the generation of highly atherogenic remnant lipoproteins (RLPs) with
remodeling of HDL into small, dysfunctional particles. Second, we will use a mouse expressing human APOA1,
HDL’s major protein, to test the role of phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) in the formation of RLPs and small
HDL particles in diabetic mice. We base this approach on the demonstration that PLTP drives the generation of
both small and large HDL particles in mice, that PLTP increases hepatic production of VLDL (the precursor of
RLPs), and that PLTP associates in Mendelian randomization studies with increased CVD risk in concert with
increased HDL-cholesterol levels and a larger percentage of small HDL. Importantly, PLTP also predicted
incident CVD in our study of T1DM patients. Collectively, our proposed experiments will provide a powerful test
of the hypothesis that a high level of small, dysfunctional HDL is a marker, and perhaps a mediator, of
increased CVD risk in patients with diabetes."
10874532,"The etiological risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its precursor lesion (cirrhosis) in the US have
dramatically changed in the past decade from predominantly active chronic viral hepatitis (hepatitis B and C) to

metabolic disorders (e.g., obesity and diabetes) that define MAFLD and their chronic incurable nature, the focus
on HCC prevention related to MAFLD is paramount. Prevention of HCC requires better understanding of the

1. Identify metabolic risk factors for HCC in a large contemporary prospective cohort of patients with
cirrhosis. We will examine associations of existing and novel metabolic candidate markers including (1) MAFLD
phenotypic features: body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, triglyceride level, HDL cholesterol level, diabetes, and
markers of insulin resistance, (2) select novel metabolic biomarker candidates identified using metabolomic and

2. Identify demographic, lifestyle features, genetic risk factors, and liver imaging markers associated
with the risk of developing HCC among patients with cirrhosis. We will examine associations of the risk of
HCC with candidate risk factors/markers i.e., (1) demographic (age, race/ethnicity, sex) and lifestyle (smoking,
physical activity) features, (2) a polygenic risk score based on established genetic markers of MAFLD (PNPLA3,
TM6SF3, MBOAT7, NCAN, PP1R3B), and (3) novel quantitative imaging markers of body fat (skin-to-liver-
capsule distance) and liver fat (hepatorenal index) estimated from radiomic analyses of liver ultrasound images.
3. Develop and optimize adaptive risk indices for predicting risk of progression to HCC among patients
with cirrhosis. We will develop a set of adaptive models including (a) a ‘basic’ index that combines demographic
and lifestyle predictors with phenotypic metabolic predictors, (b) add blood-based markers (e.g., a polygenic risk
score, metabolic risk score) to the ‘basic’ index, and (c) add liver ultrasound radiomics indices. We will assess
the performance characteristics of the risk prediction indices
The risk prediction index will have important translational implications to the comparative cost effectiveness of

10874534,"Metabolic (dysfunction) associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is now one of the most important risk factors for
hepatocellular cancer (HCC) in the U.S. Currently, no liver-specific therapies are approved for individuals with
MAFLD. Therapy that may block hepatocarcinogenesis – i.e., chemoprevention – is the only practical solution
to stem the rising tide of MAFLD-related HCC. In this context, three classes of medications (statins, metformin,
and glitazones) hold substantial promise because they act on different metabolic and/or stress-response
pathways important in MAFLD-related hepatocarcinogenesis, are commonly used to treat metabolic disorders,
and widely available. To our knowledge, no study has examined HCC chemoprevention in MAFLD. There is
also limited information about potential harms of these drugs, especially liver related adverse events (AEs)
which may be common in persons with MAFLD. The benefits and harms of chemoprevention are likely different
in different subgroups. Our study will evaluate the benefits and harms of HCC chemoprevention with these
three promising therapies in individuals with MAFLD. To do so, we will use, expand and extend a
previously assembled, well-characterized national cohort of MAFLD patients with extensive longitudinal clinical,
pharmacy, and laboratory data linked to detailed information from cancer registry, death registry and clinician
notes. Using this cohort, and as part of preliminary work, we showed a strong association between MAFLD and
HCC and reported an additive effect of metabolic traits on HCC risk. For Aim 1 (benefits of
chemoprevention), we will perform a series of carefully designed studies to evaluate the chemopreventive
effects of statins (vs. no statins), metformin (vs. no metformin) and pioglitazone (vs. no pioglitazone) in
reducing risk of incident HCC. We will also assess the heterogeneity of chemopreventive effects, with specific
focus on MAFLD patients with and without cirrhosis, those with varying severity of co-existing metabolic traits,
and perform dose-duration analyses to guide tailored chemoprevention. For Aim 2 (harms of
chemoprevention), we will use innovations in machine learning followed by manual review of medical charts
to conduct a comprehensive comparative evaluation of potential drug-related AEs among patients included in
Aim 1 emulated trials. Studies show that genetic factors contribute to differences in response to cancer
chemoprevention. In Aim 3 (genetic determinants of benefits), we will use data from an ongoing prospective
cohort of patients with MAFLD-cirrhosis to examine few suspected genetic markers that may modify the
chemopreventive effects of metformin and/or statins in individuals with MAFLD-cirrhosis. Our research is
significant because it will inform guidelines about who, when and how to recommend chemoprevention in
patients with MAFLD. Besides elucidating a potential chemopreventive effect in the general MAFLD population,
our emphasis on personalized chemoprevention is novel."
10874536,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cause of cancer deaths among Americans. Metabolic
(dysfunction) associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is now the leading cause of chronic liver disease and will
become the leading risk factor for HCC. Most HCC patients present with advanced stage and have low survival.
Therefore, HCC prevention is required to reduce the burden of MAFLD HCC. There are several gaps around
prevention of MAFLD HCC. Practice guidelines recommend ultrasound-based HCC surveillance because it can
reduce HCC-related morbidity and mortality among individuals with cirrhosis by detecting cancer at a treatable
stage. However, this clinical evidence and corresponding guidelines are based on outdated data from studies of
patients with hepatitis C or B and cannot be extrapolated to individuals with MAFLD because of a lower risk of
HCC and a higher competing cardiovascular mortality. HCC chemoprevention with metformin and statins hold
substantial promise. However, limited evidence exists on the long-term harms and benefits of HCC surveillance
or chemoprevention in individuals with MAFLD. Ideally, large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) should address
these data gaps. However, these trials are difficult to conduct due to feasibility and ethical concerns.
The goal of Project 3 is to reduce HCC related mortality and burden by evaluating comparative cost-effectiveness
of prevention strategies in individuals with MAFLD. Combining information from several published sources with
new original data from a prospective multi-site cohort of ~4000 patients with MAFLD cirrhosis (Project 1 of the
Program Project), and an emulated RCT in a large, geographically diverse retrospective cohort of >580,000
patients with MAFLD (Project 2 of the Program Project), we will develop decision-analytic models that will
weigh the risks (costs) and benefits of HCC surveillance and/or chemoprevention in MAFLD individuals.
In Aim 1, using innovative decision-analytic approach, we will simulate the natural history of MAFLD and
incorporate key data from literature and two unique two cohorts leveraged for this Program Project. We will use
this model to simulate a virtual trial comparing long-term benefits, harms, and costs of no HCC surveillance, fixed
surveillance, and tailored surveillance (frequency, start/stop times based on risk factors) with ultrasound and
also new imaging and serum biomarkers. In Specific Aim 2, we will extend the model to determine when and
for which subgroups of MAFLD patients the benefits of chemoprevention outweigh the harms, and when to start
and stop chemoprevention. To ensure that our results are useful for patients with MAFLD and their clinicians,
we will develop an interactive decision support tool, HCC Simulator, that will provide a personalized long-term
outcomes, with and without HCC surveillance and/or chemoprevention (Specific Aim 3). The HCC Simulator
will also serve as a platform to other users for conducting virtual trials on risks (costs) and benefits of novel
surveillance modalities. By providing the first comprehensive evidence on the comparative cost-effectiveness of
targeted HCC prevention, our project will have a powerful impact on guidelines on HCC prevention in MAFLD."
10882276,"Project Summary:
The encoding and consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memories requires temporal coordination of
pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region. Specifically, populations of pyramidal neurons organize into sequences
representing experience during theta and sharp-wave ripple oscillations. Disruption of the temporal coordination
of pyramidal neuron spikes during SWRs, as occurs in pathologies such as epilepsy, results in memory deficits.
The cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying pyramidal neuron spike timing during SWRs with mnemonic
functions are largely unknown.
 Local interneurons, via GABAergic inhibition, are known to regulate CA1 pyramidal neuron spike timing
in SWRs. However, there are approximately twenty types of such interneurons, each with distinct anatomy and
physiology. How each of these interneurons contributes to spiking activity and memory is unknown. The
interneurons hypothesized to have the most precise control over pyramidal neuron spike timing are the axo-
axonic (or chandelier) cell, which exclusively synapses directly onto the axon initial segment (AIS), and basket
cells which densely synapse on the soma. The functions of these cells in SWR dynamics, replay and spatial
memory formation have remained poorly understood, as there have been no reliable markers to genetically
access these neurons. In vivo investigations into the effects of axo-axonic and basket cells on pyramidal neuron
dynamics in SWRs, replay and their role in spatial memory formation is thus needed.
 In this proposal, we aim to investigate the role of axo-axonic and basket cells in mnemonic functions of
hippocampal circuits, specifically SWRs and replay, and spatial memory formation. Cre drive lines combined
with viruses encoding Cre-dependent opsins enable us to manipulate specific interneuron activity in behaving
animals. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand how the unique physiology of axo-axonic and
basket cells controls hippocampal circuit activity and pyramidal neuron coordination in network oscillations in
support of spatial memory formation."
10881530,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this project is to combine the technology of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing
tools to correct the mutant factor VIII (FVIII) genes and rescue hemophilia A (HemA) phenotype. HemA is a
bleeding disorder resulting from a deficiency of the X-linked FVIII gene. Current treatment of frequent infusions
of FVIII protein is costly, inconvenient, short-term, and incompletely effective. Gene therapy represents a highly
promising alternative method to treat HemA patients. Recent hepatocyte-directed adeno-associated viral (AAV)
gene therapy trials for HemA yielded very promising results, however, FVIII levels dropped precipitously over
time in treated patients due to yet unidentified reasons. Ectopic FVIII expression and misfolding in hepatocytes
may induce cellular stress responses and toxicity. On the other hand, a nonviral in vivo gene editing approach
can provide permanent correction of FVIII gene without using viral vectors. LSECs are the primary natural cellular
source of FVIII biosynthesis. Recently, advancement of biocompatible LNP technology enabled delivery of
nucleic acids safely into target organs. We propose to develop LSEC-targeting LNPs to deliver gene editing tools
for hemophilia treatment. We will synthesize and improve LSEC-targeting LNPs via screening of different lipid
components, optimizing lipid formulations and attaching endothelial-targeting ligands to LNPs, enabling
enhancement of targeting and delivery efficiency into LSECs. In this project, we propose to permanently correct
mutated FVIII gene and regain FVIII expression using a combination of LNPs and Clustered regularly interspaced
short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 endonuclease (Cas9) gene editing tools. We will first investigate
correction of small deletions/insertions in a unique immunodeficient NSG HemA mice. We will use the optimal
LSEC-targeting LNPs to deliver Cas9 mRNA, sgRNAs and DNA templates at different dosages and ratios to
maximize the in vivo gene editing efficacy and examine the correction via indel and/or precision repair. In addition,
in order to facilitate the clinical translation, we will investigate if safe and highly efficient gene editing of small
deletion/insertions derived from HemA patients can be achieved in PBMCs isolated from HemA patients.
Furthermore, we propose to employ the newly developed base editor (BE) to correct single base mutations. BE
can achieve efficient precision editing without double strand breaks (DSBs) for enhanced safety. For selected
point mutations from HemA patients, we will test in vivo gene editing using specific BE in mutant FVIII plasmid
treated HemA mice. Next, we will use the optimal LSEC-targeting LNPs to deliver BE to restore FVIII gene
expression in the corresponding specific transgenic mouse model harboring a human FVIII exon with the
mutation site. Furthermore, we will investigate if the corresponding point mutations can be corrected using the
specific BE in PBMCs isolated from HemA patients. This project will facilitate the development of novel gene
editing strategies for personalized treatment of HemA patients."

 The Columbia University ADRC’s Neuroimmunology (Neuroimm) Core supports the development of
biosample and data resources along one of the three thematic axes of the ADRC. Characterizing immune
responses is an important component of AD investigations, but these responses are not solely responsible for
the disease. Thus, it is important to integrate thoughtful, informed study design, specialized resources as well as
emerging experimental and analytic pipelines for systematic immune function characterization with existing
biomarker, genetic, neuroimaging and other resources to assemble a comprehensive approach to AD
investigations. Our understanding of the role of the immune system in AD is rapidly evolving, and innate immune
cells appear to play a key role. Thus, we propose to: (1) create a new sample resource by cryopreserving CSF
cells from each recruited subject, (2) create new assays that measure surrogate markers of microglia in CSF,
(3) assess the systemic state of inflammation in each of the sampled subjects, and (4) estimate the functional
capacity of each individual’s microglia to respond to key stimuli. Thus, we will generate novel sample, assay,
and data resources with which to accelerate the characterization of the immune system in AD."

 In Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), a rapidly developing field has gained 
comprehensive insights into a host of likely complementary disease mechanisms, shedding light on relevant 
genetic and environmental factors, a continuum of neuropathological abnormalities, biomarkers that represent 
the earliest stages of disease, and an array of clinical presentations. Yet, large gaps in knowledge remain 
regarding disease modeling, genetics and pathophysiology, and of course, treatment. The Columbia University 
(CU) Research Education Component (REC) will be a comprehensive training program to effectively and 
efficiently develop the next generation of ADRD leaders poised to make breakthroughs in ADRD research 
through both established and novel research methods. The CU REC Training Program will provide training for 
researchers comprising two distinct groups: a) those entering ADRD research through conventional training 
paths (e.g., neurologists, neuropsychologists, basic and translational researchers) with great promise to 
contribute to the field in the near term, and b) researchers from non-conventional paths (e.g., 
bioinformatics/data science, engineering, public health, and allied health) who have demonstrated unique and 
accomplished research skills, which if reoriented to ADRD, could make novel and important impacts on ADRD 
research. The REC Training Program enhances primary aims of the CU ADRC: to enable and enhance 
ongoing research efforts in ADRD at CU, and support a diverse group of ADRD researchers making these 
discoveries. The CU REC Training Program provides a structured framework that promising junior researchers, 
identified through our vast institutional research infrastructure, can leverage to establish successful careers in 
ADRD. With ongoing, multidisciplinary mentorship tied to a structured research project, effectively supported 
junior researchers can independently develop hypotheses, critically appraise related literature, and frame a 
sophisticated approach to an appropriately honed research question. Training will include an individualized 
development plan tailored to each trainee and his or her current and future career steps, enabling a 
foundational understanding from which to launch a successful research career. This program will build upon 
the longstanding practices of the CU ADRC and Department of Neurology, the latter having the highest track 
record of trainees becoming academic neurologists of any institution in the world. In sum, the overarching goal 
of the REC Training Program is to develop the next generation of ADRD researchers by: 1) identifying 3-5 
junior investigators with promise for making significant contributions to the field of ADRD (Aim 1); 2) drawing 
trainees from ADRD fields as well as fields beyond traditional pathways to ADRD research, especially those 
from diverse backgrounds (Aim 2); and 3) providing all trainees with an individualized development plan that 
includes multidisciplinary mentorship, experiences within the expansive internal research and education 
program at CU, and an integrated plan to understand how to access and achieve sustained grant support 
towards next career steps (Aim 3)."

10885986,"Project Summary/Abstract
 This proposal for a five-year mentored research career development project focuses on elucidating
the role of the type 1 diabetes (T1D) PTPN2 risk allele in loss of B cell anergy. Previously B cells
bearing antigen receptors with high affinity for insulin were found only in the anergic B cell compartment of
healthy individuals. Importantly, these cells leave this compartment in a proportion of first-degree relatives
(FDRs), and in all autoantibody positive pre-diabetics and recent onset diabetics. Departure of these
autoreactive anergic B cells in FDRs was shown to be associated with high risk T1D HLA alleles, and three
high risk non-HLA alleles, including INS (rs689), PTPN2 (rs1893217), and IKZF3 (rs2872507). Of the three
non-HLA risk alleles, only PTPN2 has been previously shown to be a negative regulator of signaling. However
these previous studies were completed in mice, not humans, and their exact mechanism by which they
contribute to development and signaling has yet to be determined. This application proposes to determine the
effect of the T1D risk variant of PTPN2 in maintenance of B cell anergy. Aim 1 will explore the effect of the risk
variant on the phenotype of the B cell compartment in FDRs of T1D patients and their response to stimulation.
Aim 2 will explore the relationship of loss of anergic B cells with the high risk T1D genotype allele, Ptpn2, using
a reductionist mouse model. The potential impact of these studies will lie in understanding how risk alleles
conspire to undermine maintenance of immune tolerance to autoantigens in T1D.

10886015,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Aberrant glial activation has been postulated to promote neurodegeneration. But, what triggers glial activation
and how perturbations to glia-neuron interaction contribute to brain aging and neurodegeneration remains
unclear. The scientific premise of this proposal is based on previously published work that dominant mutation in
human Progranulin (GRN) gene is a major cause for frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations in GRN cause a
drastic reduction in Progranulin (PGRN) protein levels in brain tissues and eventually lead to neuropathology
characterized by profound gliosis, severe neuron loss, and aggregation of RNA binding protein TDP-43 in
remaining neurons (also known as “TDP-43 proteinopathy”). In addition to its role in FTD, single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) in the GRN gene has been associated with increased risk of TDP-43 proteinopathy in
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in the aging brain. Together, these results support the idea that PGRN deficiency
may have broader impacts on neurodegeneration. To investigate the role of PGRN deficiency in
neurodegeneration, we have shown that mouse models of PGRN deficiency recapitulate several key
neuropathological features in FTD caused by GRN mutations, including microglial activation, microglia-mediated
synaptic pruning, and dysfunction in the thalamocortical circuit, which contribute to obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD)-like behaviors in these mice. In addition, we used single cell transcriptomic analyses to show
that Grn-/- microglia exhibit early onset and persistent transcriptomic changes in genes involved in the
endolysosomal pathway and innate immunity functions. Furthermore, proteomic and morphological analyses in
Grn-/- microglia revealed prominent features of cellular senescence, including increased phagocytosis, lysosomal
dysfunction, proliferative arrest, and increased secretion of complements C1q and C3b. These results support
the hypothesis that PGRN deficiency disrupts endolysosomal function and activates the cellular senescence
program in microglia leading to persistent microglial activation to promote synaptic pruning and neuronal cell
death. To test this hypothesis, we will (1) determine the role of integrin αvβ3 and TGF-β pathway in promoting
cellular senescence in Grn-/- microglia, (2) characterize the secretory phenotype in senescent microglia in Grn-/-
mice and its impact on neurodegeneration, and (3) elucidate the impact of PGRN deficiency on microglial
senescence and neurodegeneration in FTD and Alzheimer's disease. Results from this proposal will provide
critical insights into the mechanism of PGRN deficiency in microglial senescence and its role in
neurodegeneration in FTD and AD."

 The yellow fever 17D live-attenuated vaccine has been administered to millions of people and is a highly
successful and safe vaccine providing essentially life-long protection. However, the mechanisms of attenuation
are poorly understood, and rare individuals suffer from sometimes fatal severe adverse events (SAEs) including
yellow fever-like viscerotropic disease, or neurologic disease. Epidemics of this mosquito-borne disease continue
to occur in tropical and sub-tropical regions of South America and Africa, so understanding the mechanisms of
17D attenuation and the factors predisposing to SAEs is critical for development of safer vaccines and SAE
prevention or treatment strategies. Work of others and of ours in the prior funding period determined that type I
interferon (IFN) responses are greater after infection of cells with 17D compared to the virulent Asibi parental
strain. New preliminary data demonstrate that the prophylactic IFN-induced antiviral state is also more effective
at controlling 17D. Importantly, our work uncovered mutations in genes encoding type I IFN receptor chains
(IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) and autoantibodies against type I IFNs as factors causing SAEs after 17D vaccination,
thus linking the observed IFN phenotype with 17D attenuation in vivo. We also discovered a differential
requirement between 17D and Asibi, mediated by the viral NS4B protein, for the host factor TMEM41B, with
increased innate immune responses to 17D in TMEM41B KO cells. Prior studies have been hampered by the
disparate specific infectivities of 17D and Asibi, precluding meaningful comparisons in bulk cell-based assays.
New preliminary data demonstrates that 17D and Asibi harboring the 17D E protein (Asibi+17D E) have similar
specific infectivities, replicate with similar kinetics in the HepG2 hepatocyte cell line, and maintain previously
described differences in IFN transcription and secretion. Unexpectedly, levels of phosphorylated STAT1 are
similar in 17D- and Asibi+17D E-infected cells. In this project continuation, in Aim 1 17D and Asibi+17D E will be
used to examine pattern recognition receptor activation, including kinase activation and downstream
transcriptional responses using phosphoproteomics and RNASeq. The mechanism by which Asibi+17D E blocks
IFN secretion, the process by which STAT1 phosphorylation occurs and the consequences to infection and role
of individual ISGs in controlling 17D and Asibi infection will be elucidated. In Aim 2 interactions of Asibi and 17D
with both pro- and anti-viral host factors will be characterized through imaging-based methods allowing single
cell resolution. We will examine responses in the infected cell and the influence of individual genes (at genome
scale) on innate immunity and infection. Patient-specific mutations associated with SAEs will be functionally
interrogated as we have done previously. In Aim 3 the role of NS4B in differential TMEM41B requirements will
be elucidated using proteomic and mutational approaches. These studies will uncover critical host-pathogen
interactions that can be exploited to develop safer vaccines, SAE treatment or prevention approaches, and new
drug targets. The information gained can also be broadly applied to vaccine development for other flaviviruses."
10886018,"Project Summary. Every year, more than 500,000 patients undergo operations for heart and lung disease.
After surgery, patients often experience pain, fatigue, and disturbed sleep that can persist for weeks to months.
In addition, up to 32% of patients develop postoperative complications, which often occur after discharge from
the hospital and may lead to readmission. Complications are costly and can be deadly; they are associated
with a 200-300% increase in healthcare costs and a 6-fold increase in 90-day postoperative mortality.
Currently, after surgery, when a patient is discharged from the hospital, the patient and their family members
are responsible for monitoring the patient’s health status. Patients are usually not seen by a doctor for 2-4
weeks after discharge. Attempts to improve postoperative monitoring include home health visits and
telemedicine approaches. However, these methods have been shown to be ineffective, costly, and allow for
only vague and intermittent assessments of recovery. They do not detect complications until they are at a
more severe stage. As such, accurate, easy-to-implement and inexpensive methods to assess postoperative
recovery and to detect complications at their earliest stage—before symptom onset—are urgently needed.
We previously showed that machine learning analysis of biometrics collected by wearables could detect Lyme
Disease and Covid-19. We then, in a pilot study, applied our algorithm, previously developed to identify Covid-
19, to patients undergoing thoracic surgery and showed that this algorithm could detect 89% of complications a
median of 3 days before symptom onset. When we evaluated the postoperative recovery of cardiothoracic
patients, we showed that machine learning analysis of biometrics could classify patients into distinct recovery
groups. Thus, wearables and machine learning algorithms could lead to a highly accurate and accessible
method to predict complications early and improve assessments of recovery.
Our overall objective is to optimize and validate our machine learning algorithm—previously developed for the
early detection of Covid-19—for the detection of postoperative complications prior to symptom onset and to
use machine learning analysis to predict the quality of a patient’s recovery using pre- and intraoperative data.
Our project aims to first use wearables to collect high-resolution physiologic data of cardiothoracic surgical
patients. We will then extend our previously developed algorithm for early detection of postoperative
complications and develop an algorithm to predict the quality of a patient’s postoperative recovery.
The proposed project will develop an innovative method to detect postoperative complications prior to
symptom onset and predict the quality of a patient’s postoperative recovery using pre- and intraoperative data.
Importantly, our proposed method could be scaled to not only improve outcomes for cardiothoracic surgical
patients, but for patients undergoing other types of surgery. The results of this study will enable a future
randomized trial that evaluates whether real-time postoperative monitoring with machine learning algorithms
and wearables can lead to 1) earlier detection of complications, 2) earlier outpatient interventions that improve
recovery and/or reduce severity of complications, and 3) decreases in unplanned hospital readmissions."

Obesity is a major health problem in the United States and associated with increased risk of diabetes. There is
a great need for interventions that can assist with long-term maintenance of healthy body weight and be
sustainably integrated into existing health care teams. We have developed and tested an innovative weight
loss maintenance intervention – Maintaining Activity and Nutrition through Technology-Assisted Innovation in
Primary Care (MAINTAIN-pc) – delivered through the electronic health record (EHR) to help patients maintain
recent intentional weight loss and successful lifestyle strategies. We have conducted and published results
from a randomized clinical trial of MAINTAIN-pc at the University of Pittsburgh and found that participants who
received EHR tracking tools and personalized coaching had significantly lower weight regain at 24 months
(primary outcome) than participants who received EHR tracking tools alone. MAINTAIN-pc leveraged
commonly available health information technology (HIT) tools to track participant progress and support patients
and their providers in ongoing efforts to maintain weight loss. Despite the success of MAINTAIN-pc, two key
questions about the practicality and sustainability of this intervention remain unanswered: (i) whether
the HIT could be adapted at other sites and (ii) whether coaching could be delivered leveraging
existing staff resources rather than interventionists supported by a research grant. We propose a
pragmatic clinical trial to test the implementation and impact of the MAINTAIN-pc protocol in routine healthcare
settings: MAINTAIN PRIME (Promoting Real (World) IMplEmentation). MAINTAIN PRIME will be conducted in
14 primary care practices affiliated with the University of Utah and will capitalize on further advances in HIT
(e.g., dashboards to track patient populations) and team-based care models to deliver the intervention with
minimal support from research staff. MAINTAIN PRIME will measure costs to inform future sustainability, and it
will study workflow and individual, clinical, and organizational attributes to determine facilitators and barriers to
successful implementation. Our proposed project will include three phases: 1) pre-implementation, in which we
will do collaborative implementation design with clinic and IT teams and vanguard implementation mapping; 2)
implementation, in which we will conduct a pragmatic clinical trial with weight change at 24 months as the
primary outcome; and 3) post-implementation, in which we will evaluate the success of MAINTAIN PRIME,
including barriers, facilitators, and costs that will inform future sustainability and be summarized in a “toolkit” to
foster dissemination. By focusing on weight maintenance and relapse prevention, increased use of existing
staff, and integration with HIT systems and tools, we will fill a crucial gap in the long-term treatment of obesity
as a chronic medical condition."

Geroscience refers to the multi-disciplinary approach to understand, at the molecular level, the relationship be-
tween aging-associated pathologies and aging. Unfortunately, there continues to be a fundamental knowledge
gap in implicating how these mechanisms predispose to a myriad of diseases with advancing age, including
neurodegenerative diseases (ND) like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This lack of comprehension represents a sig-
nificant problem because, until it is recognized, development of interventions that prevent or attenuate this de-
bilitating disease will continue to be unattainable. Senescent cells (SnCs) accumulate with age and at sites of
age-related pathology and have been demonstrated to actively drive tissue deterioration. As removal of these
cells has largely beneficial consequences for aging and lifespan, these cells are particularly attractive candi-
dates to test the geroscience hypothesis that attenuated ‘rates of aging’ may delay neurodegenerative diseas-
es and other age-related conditions. The long-term goal of the laboratory is to exploit SnC clearance as a ther-
apeutic strategy for a variety of age-related diseases, including AD. Cells with features reminiscent of senes-
cence have been observed in post mortem AD patients, therefore the overall objective in this application is to
determine whether SnC elimination from established ND models attenuates disease severity. The central hy-
pothesis is that SnCs actively drive disease processes and that removal of these cells will prevent or delay AD
progression and severity. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of unpublished preliminary data
produced in the applicants’ laboratory included in this application. The rationale for the proposed research is
that once it is known how senescence of specific cell types in the brains impacts pathology, it can be tested if
novel pharmacological modulations of SnCs and/or their effects influences the disease process. Guided by
strong preliminary data, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Establish the therapeu-
tic potential of SnC removal in ND; and 2) Evaluate how attenuated SnC accumulation impacts ND and normal
cognitive aging. Under the first aim, various methods of SnC elimination will be used in established disease to
attenuate severity using novel mouse models established as feasible in the applicants’ laboratory. Under the
second aim, senescence in specific cell types will be prevented to determine how this influences disease se-
verity and SnCs will be genetically removed from geriatric mice to determine if this impacts cognition. The ap-
proach is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, because it departs from the status quo by utilizing an entirely
novel approach to counteract ND through modulation of SnCs. The proposed research is significant, because it
will address key fundamental questions about SnCs in ND and test whether targeting SnCs is a potential ther-
apeutic strategy for this disease. This knowledge will pave the way towards transformative clinical interventions
for treating or preventing not only ND, but also a broad spectrum of human age-related diseases."
10886035,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The hallmark symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and most common complaint among cognitively healthy
older adults is memory loss, especially for everyday events such as conversations with a loved one, a meal with
friends, a trip to the grocery store. However, there is a critical difference between remembering these types of
events and those that are often measured in the laboratory or in neuropsychological batteries, which often lack
real-world contextual meaning. This project will investigate failures in memory for everyday activities by using
dynamic real-world stimuli in which episodic memory is formed during a continuous stream of experience. We will
test the extent to which older adults use semantic knowledge to create stable mental representations during
the continuous stream of everyday experiences, and whether this ability changes in the early stages of AD.
Such knowledge-related improvements could benefit older adults' ability to remember day-to-day information,
make effective decisions in everyday life (e.g., decisions about healthcare and estate planning), and interact
with new technology––all of which will improve their quality of life. This goal is highly relevant to the NIH core
mission “to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of
that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.” Aim 1 of this project will
determine whether deficits in event memory are explained by age-related differences in maintaining stable
mental representations during an experience. Aim 2 will determine whether older adults can effectively
integrate new event information into existing knowledge structures. Aim 3 will determine whether cueing prior
knowledge improves event memory in early-stage AD. The project will use an innovative combination of
behavioral and neurophysiological measures of event encoding to address these aims. It will also use dynamic
activities that are often encountered in daily life—the kind that older adults report having difficulties
remembering. We predict that mPFC-mediated prior knowledge will facilitate the integration of new event
information with prior knowledge resulting in better segmentation and event memory for older adults. However,
when no prior knowledge is available, the extent to which people can effectively segment an activity (supported
by mPFC-hippocampal coupling) will predict memory performance. Further, we predict that cueing relevant
knowledge will scaffold the learning of new schema-consistent event information in cognitively healthy older
adults and those with early AD. Our goal of improving older adults' ability to encode and retrieve everyday
activities is aligned with the NIA's vision for older adults to “enjoy robust health and independence, remain
physically and mentally active, and continue to make positive contributions to their families and communities.”"
10883161,"Abstract
 Veterans and the general public with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have a high risk of developing
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression. The
pathophysiological basis that contributes to comorbid PTSD and other psychiatric disorders following TBI is not
yet understood, and there are currently few effective treatments for comorbid TBI/PTSD. Serotonergic
dysfunction and neuroinflammation are strongly associated with TBI and psychiatric disorders. Gut microbiota
dysfunction induces inflammation and affects tryptophan metabolism, a precursor of serotonin, which is
involved in serotonin biosynthesis. Studies conducted on patients with PTSD and other psychiatric disorders,
as well as mice exposed to experimental stress, have shown a high correlation between perturbation in gut
microbiota and mental disorders. TBI also induces gut microbiota dysbiosis. However, the cause-effect
relationship and the underlying mechanisms by which gut microbiota disruption following TBI impacts comorbid
PTSD and other psychiatric disorders are still largely unknown. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), small nanovesicles,
play a crucial role in cellular communication and carry various molecules. Bacterial EVs in the gut contain
bacterial genetic and biomaterials that are associated with virulence and considered causative agents in many
diseases, while EVs produced by select probiotics have great therapeutic potential. Our pilot data reveal that
administration of TBI-gut-EVs to gnotobiotic mice affects the expression of genes related to host serotonin
metabolites and neuroinflammation. In contrast, treatment of TBI animals with EVs derived from select probiotics
significantly increases host serotonin levels and alleviates psychiatric-like behavior. Based on our novel findings,
we hypothesize that the changes in gut microbiota-derived TBI-gut-EVs are involved in the regulation of
serotonergic neurons, neuroinflammation, and PTSD-like behavioral impairments following TBI. The successful
completion of this study will not only provide new insight into the pathogenesis of TBI, but also promote the
development of novel microbial-based therapy for preventing and/or treating comorbid TBI/PTSD, and potentially
other psychiatric disorders."
10883266,"Project Summary:
This proposal is a renewal application of R01 (AI130197). In the previous funding cycle, we sought to identify
the mechanism(s) by which the small adaptor protein Crk controls NK cell activation and inhibition, using
human NK cells and NK cell-specific conditional knockout mice. We found that Crk phosphorylation plays a key
role in function and that Crk haploinsufficiency leads to NK cell deficits and impaired integrin signaling.
Importantly, we identified new small molecule inhibitors of pCrk (Patent #: 63/305,354). In the proposed
renewal, we use this new tool to further dissect Crk’s ability to integrate activating and inhibitory input at the
immune synapse (IS) of both NK and T cells in a variety of relevant settings: in high-resolution live human
primary cell imaging assays, in human Crk haploinsufficiency, and in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). We
test our central hypothesis that Crk functions as a master regulatory switch, fine-tuning activating and
inhibitory influences via interactions with downstream molecules and the actin cytoskeleton, and propose the
new hypothesis that pCrk inhibition can restore exhausted immune responses in cancer via novel signaling
pathways. Guided by strong preliminary data, we propose three Specific Aims: 1) How does Crk function as
a master regulatory switch to control NK cell function? Here, we use cutting-edge imaging systems, lipid
bilayers, live human primary cells, RNA-Seq, and our new CrkL inhibitors to determine where Crk, pCrk, and
their upstream and downstream partners localize in the cytotoxic, inhibitory, and exhausted IS, and how pCrk
inhibitors influence NK signaling in healthy and exhausted NK cells. 2) How does Crk influence immune
function and integrin signaling in pDGS T cells? Our previous program showed that NK cells from patients
with pDGS – a common genetic syndrome resulting from haploinsufficiency of CrkL-containing locus 22q11 –
exhibit functional NK cell deficiencies, as well as defective integrin activation at the IS. We expand these
studies to T cells, using primary pDGS patient cells and integrin conformation-specific antibodies to assess
how Crk functions as a two-way regulatory switch for CTL function. We present data that haploinsufficiency of
CRKL results in functional T cell deficits, and examine integrin signaling, T cell function, and IS quality with an
eye towards clinical application of small molecule LFA-1 agonists to restore pDGS-related functional immune
cell deficiencies. 3) Discover the role of pCrkL inhibitors in cancer immunotherapy. Our preliminary data
show that pCrk inhibitors significantly inhibit tumor growth, restore cytotoxicity of inhibitor receptor-dominant
immune cells, and enhance survival. We hypothesize that pCrk inhibitor-mediated solid tumor suppression
results from both direct tumor killing and restoration of exhausted immune cell function. In Aim 3, we use a
battery of TNBC mouse models to elucidate Crk’s molecular mechanisms in solid tumors, testing the impact of
Crk inhibition on tumor growth and cell death, immune cell function in the tumor microenvironment, and
metastasis. Our long-term goal is to develop new treatments for human immunodeficiencies and cancer."
10882475,"Mechanisms of neural patterning and the generation of neural diversity in the brain.
 We have shown that neural diversity in the optic lobe of Drosophila is generated by three mechanisms: Each neural
stem cell (neuroblast; NB) expresses sequentially a series of temporal transcription factors (tTF) and divides to produce an
intermediate precursor that divides once more to generate a NotchON and a NotchOFF neuron. The neuroepithelium that
generates NBs is patterned by spatial TFs (sTFs) and by signaling molecules. Different regions of the neuroepithelium
generate NBs that undergo the same tTF series but produce different neurons due to spatial patterning of the neuroepithelium
of origin. We offer to continue our investigations into the development of the medulla and address whether stochastic factors
complement the deterministic and intrinsic programs that generate diversity (Aim 1) and investigate how many different
spatial regions comprise the NE and how this spatial patterning controls the stoichiometry of neurons (Aim 2).
 There are many more than 800 NBs to produce neurons populating the 800 medulla columns that process visual
information from the 800 unit-eyes in the fly retina. We will test whether an excess number of the same neurons is produced
from all the NBs and culled later by apoptosis, or whether the temporal series progresses independently of cell cycle: In the
latter case, the lack of coordination between the progression of the temporal series and cell cycle introduces a stochastic
component that would allow flexibility in the identity (and number) of the neurons produced by each NB. The role of
stochastic patterning of neural stem cells has been demonstrated in mammals but is very poorly understood. The repetitive
structure and precise genetic manipulations in the fly optic lobe make this system ideal to address these questions:
 Aim 1: Progression of the temporal series and cell cycle: The many NBs (at least twice as many as columns)
suggest that neurons are produced in excess and culled, or that each NB only produces stochastically a subset of the neurons.
Aim 1.1: Do NBs produce excess numbers of neurons and those that do not find a partner are later culled by cell death?
Aim 1.2: Is the progression of temporal windows coordinated with cell cycle?
Aim 1.3: Are all temporal windows used to generate all the neurons that a given NB could produce?
Aim 1.4: What is the temporal window of origin of the ~100 medulla neurons?
Aim 1.5: Does the length of temporal windows determine the number of neurons produced at each temporal window?
Aim 1.6: Does the speed of transition of temporal windows rely on regulation of RNA stability and/or translation status?
 Aim 2: Spatial patterning and epigenetic memory: How do NBs from different spatial domains undergo the
same temporal series but produce different neurons in different stoichiometry?
Aim 2.1: How does Dpp signaling generate at least three subdomains within one of the spatial domains?
Aim 2.2: Define new spatial sub-domains using scRNAseq of neuroepithelial cells
Aim 2.3: Is the spatial identity of neuroepithelial cells transmitted to NBs and neurons by epigenetic memory?
Aim 2.4: Use scRNAseq to identify the neurons produced by each spatial domain.
Aim 2.5: How does the integration of spatio-temporal patterning and Notch signaling control neuronal features?"
10883449,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety are linked to brain deficits in the bioenergetic molecules creatine
(CR) and acetyl-L carnitine (ALC), nutritional supplements which show potential as antidepressants. MDD and
anxiety are often comorbid, and affect 20% of US adults. Moreover, cognitive dysfunction contributes markedly
to MDD-linked functional disability. Classical antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) are ineffective in ~50% of patients, and mostly do not improve cognitive symptoms. Unlike classical
antidepressants, bioenergetic compounds show promise for improving multiple aspects of MDD symptomology,
including cognitive function and comorbid anxiety. We now plan to explore the bioenergetic compounds CR,
cyclocreatine (CyCR, a CR analog) and ALC as therapeutics in a model for treatment resistant depression (TRD).
We established a sex-based animal model to study etiology of the high rates of MDD and anxiety in people at
altitude (hypobaric hypoxia). At moderate altitude (4500ft), rats of both sexes exhibit symptoms of depression,
anxiety and cognitive dysfunction vs. those at sea level, and a sustained lack of response to most SSRIs. Hypo-
baric hypoxia induces brain bioenergetic deficits, and CR, CyCR and ALC can reduce the deficit to show sex-
based antidepressant-like or anxiolytic-like efficacy in this model. Brain bioenergetic deficits are directly linked
to MDD, but can further promote onset of MDD by causing inflammation and oxidative stress. Hypoxia-inducible
transcription factors (HIFs) interact with the oxidative stress system to mediate cellular response to hypoxia, and
CR can alter HIF activation. Our central hypothesis is that bioenergetic compounds will improve status of de-
pression, anxiety and cognitive function by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress at altitude. In Aim 1, we
will identify impact of CR, CyCR and ALC vs. SSRI on behavioral symptoms. Efficacy in reducing symptoms of
depression (in forced swim, sucrose preference tests), anxiety (e.g., marble burying, elevated T-maze tests) and
cognitive dysfunction (e.g., novelty object, radial arm tests) will be tested. In Aim 2, we will study the mode of
action by which bioenergetic compounds reduce MDD-linked biomarkers. The impact of CR, CyCR and ALC on
biomarkers of inflammation (e.g., the nonspecific inflammatory marker CRF, inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL6,
IL1β), HIF1a activation and oxidative stress (e.g., reactive oxygen species, antioxidants) will be assessed. In
Aim 3, we will test molecular mechanisms via which bioenergetic compounds protect against TRD. In our model,
bioenergetic drugs may protect against TRD by activating HIFs. CR and ALC can also activate mTOR, PI3K or
NfκB pathways. We will now use inhibitors of the signaling pathways likely involved (HIF1a, mTOR, PI3K, NfκB)
to block behavioral and biomarker impacts of bioenergetic drugs. Data from studies in this model will further be
confirmed using the chronic restraint stress rodent model. These studies are designed to have translational value
towards improving multiple aspects of TRD symptomology, including cognitive dysfunction and anxiety, and to
investigate novel therapeutic mechanisms as targets for TRD."
10870747,"Differences between mouse and human γδ T cells have hindered a better understanding of the role of these
innate lymphocytes in human cancer, due in part to the lack of relevant transgenic models. Key advances in the
previous funding cycle of this grant underscored the crucial role of γδ T cells in human ovarian cancer and how
butyrophilins govern their phenotypes. Building upon our new preliminary results, our central hypothesis is that
that BTNL9, in a lipid-dependent manner, activates crucial subsets of anti-tumor δ1 T cells in an “innate-like”,
CDR3-independent fashion, through binding to specific variable γ regions. Furthermore, novel allogeneic cellular
therapies using exhaustion-resilient δ1 T cells as a CAR T cell platform, in a BTNL9-dependent manner, will be
more effective at in halting the progression of epithelial human cancers, compared to conventional αβ CAR T
cells, particularly in tumors with low antigenic expression. These hypotheses will be tested in these Aims:
In Specific Aim 1, we will elucidate the detailed mechanism by which BTNL9 activates various subsets of
γδ1 T cells in a lipid-dependent manner. Based on this knowledge, we will also define the crucial role ofBTNL9-
dependent Vδ1 TILs in anti-tumor immunity in human cancer, in conjunction with other γδ T cell subsets.
In Specific Aim 2, we will characterize the heterogeneity and trajectory of evolution of human cancer-
infiltrating γδ1 T cells. These studies will define the anti-tumor activity of different γδ T cell subsets and the
molecular drivers of the evolution of protective phenotypes in vivo in human cancer.
In Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate new allogeneic cell therapies that exploit the resilience of Vδ1 T cell
effector activity in human epithelial cancer. These experiments will provide a rationale for ensuing CAR T cell
therapies using Vδ1 T cells and γδ TCR signals as a potentially superior platform for controlling the progression
of CAR T cell-refractory malignancies, as compared to autologous conventional αβ T cells.
These studies will not only address the knowledge gap concerning the interaction between butyrophilins and γδ
T cells in human cancer, but also establish a mechanistic rationale for novel cellular therapies that can effectively
combat aggressive and common solid human cancers, paving the way for ""off the shelf"" CAR T cell therapies."
10872013,"Abnormal valve development contributes to many common congenital heart malformations.
Developmental signaling events that regulate early valve formation have been studied extensively, however,
the mechanisms that underlie latter stages of remodeling to mature valves remain poorly understood. We have
recently identified a critical time point at the early stage of semilunar valve remodeling that is fundamental for
normal aortic valve formation and have also identified a unique endocardial signaling axis, TIE2-PI3K/AKT-
FOXO1, that plays a pivotal role in orchestrating this early remodeling process. Therefore, we propose to 1)
Delineate the unique roles of TIE2 signaling in heart valve remodeling in vivo. We will utilize our newly
developed inducible endocardial Cell (EC) specific Nfatc1CreERT2 line, pan-endocardial (Nfatc1Cre) line, and
valvular endocardial specific (Nfatc1enCre) line, to generate valvular EC-specific Tie2 conditional knockout (ko)
models. PostnMCM will likewise be used to generate valvular mesenchymal cell ko mutants.
We will
thoroughly
examine the cardiac phenotypes of these conditional mutant mice and determine the direct effectors of
endocardial TIE2 signaling in heart valve remodeling. 2) Define the role of the TIE2-PI3K/AKT-FOXO1
signaling during semilunar valve remodeling in vivo. We will generate an EC overexpression of a gain-of-
function FOXO1 mouse line (FOXO1CA). We will also generate Tie2 and FoxO1 double knock out mutants via
utilization of Nfatc1CreERT2 and Tie2 and FoxO1 floxed alleles and EC overexpression of a gain-of-function PI3K
mouse line (PIK3CAH1047R) via Nfatc1Cre and Nfatc1enCre, respectively. The resultant mutant mice will be
thoroughly analyzed to determine which components of the cardiac valve defects seen in Tie2-icko and
Nfatc1enCre;PIK3CAH1047R mutant mice are phenocopied or rescued, thus defining the specific roles of TIE2-
PI3K/AKT-FOXO1 signaling in valve formation. 3) Identify additional down-stream targets of TIE2
activation that regulate heart valve remodeling. To validate and reinforce the TIE2-FOXO1 linear pathway
proposed based on in vivo studies, we will analyze candidate gene/protein expression of cultured endothelial
cells exposed to CAng1, a potent Angpt1 variant agonist, and PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) in the presence or
absence of Tie2. In addition, we will use bulk RNAseq of cultured cells and scRNAseq of outflow tracts
harvested from control and inducible endocardial Tie2 ko embryos to identify and characterize additional TIE2-
dependent signaling pathways required for semilunar valve development. These studies will provide the first
characterization of the critical period of aortic valve remodeling immediately following EMT. This work will also
elucidate a uniqe endocardial signaling mechanism (namely, the TIE2-FOXO1 axis) that modulates
remodeling in cardiac valve formation. These studies are essential to advance our understanding of normal
cardiac valve ontogeny and will be foundational for deciphering the mechanisms of disease pathology related
to valve formation and function."
10871999,"ABSTRACT
Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is common among adolescents and young adults with a heritable bleeding
disorder (BD) and negatively impacts health-related quality of life and physical and mental health status.
Effective treatment options are available that decrease bleeding and improve quality of life, but were not
studied in those with BD, so we do not know if there is similar effectiveness in this condition. We also do not
know the impact of treatment on diagnostic testing for BD or on improvement of iron deficiency. Given these
gaps in knowledge, the primary objective of the Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Progestin Treatment in
Bleeding Disorders Study is to conduct a multicenter prospective pragmatic trial, enrolling adolescents and
young adults with HMB cared for at collaborating multi-disciplinary menstrual clinic sites nationally who are
choosing to initiate hormonal menstrual suppression with a progestin treatment option (N=300). In Aim 1, we
will compare outcomes related to (a) bleeding management, (b) quality of life, and (c) repletion of iron storage
levels after six months of treatment with either 52 mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUD)
or oral norethindrone acetate 5 mg daily (NETA) in those with a diagnosed heritable BD. The primary outcome
will be treatment success with a Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBAC) score <50 points by six
months. Secondary objectives to assess bleeding management will include change in PBAC from baseline to 6
months, and self-reported treatment success. Quality of life outcomes will include change in validated scales
(aMBQ, PROMIS-25, PROMIS-29) to assess health-related quality of life which are specific to adolescents and
young adults in the setting of HMB. We will compare the change in ferritin levels at six months from baseline to
determine the relative amount of benefit obtained from either treatment option. In Aim 2, we will compare
outcomes after LNG-IUD in those with and without a BD, assessing rates of expulsion and method continuation
between the two groups in addition to the outcomes assessed for Aim 1. In Aim 3, we will improve our
understanding of the impact of HMB and iron deficiency on von Willebrand disease (VWD) diagnostic studies
by comparing change in von Willebrand factor levels before and after successful treatment in those with HMB
without a previous diagnosis of VWD, aiding our understanding of diagnostic parameters. Despite significant
safety records, concerns about the use of hormonal medications in youth grow among U.S. families and
providers. We must measure the therapeutic impact of treatment – not just on bleeding, but also on quality of
life and health. This study will demonstrate the relative benefits of menstrual suppression treatment options for
adolescents and young adults with HMB and heritable BDs, will provide population-specific estimates for
expected benefit that can be used in treatment counseling, and will highlight the impact of treatment status on
diagnostic test results."

The overarching goal of the Duke Superfund Research Center (DUSRC) is to determine later life consequences
of early life exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals. In accordance with the
Superfund Mandate on understanding epidemiological and ecological impacts of exposure to hazardous
chemicals, DUSRC-Project 4 addresses ecological outcomes of PAH and metal exposure in an evolutionary
toxicology context. Evolved resistance to hazardous contaminants has far reaching implications for
environmental health, ecological risk assessment, and management. However, key knowledge gaps exist in our
understanding of the mechanisms of pollution adaptation and fitness consequences, especially when animals
are exposed to multiple chemicals (simultaneous or sequential) and other abiotic stressors in their natural
environment. Addressing these gaps, we extend our extensive previous research on evolved resistance to PAHs
in Atlantic killifish Fundulus heteroclitus in the Elizabeth River (ER), VA, in a new direction. Specifically, we will
elucidate the role of mitochondria as an important target of PAHs and metals during early development in
mediating adverse behavioral and bioenergetic outcomes later in life and in subsequent generations under
optimal and suboptimal thermal and dissolved oxygen conditions. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 – to determine
later life fitness consequences of early life simultaneous exposures to PAHs and Cd and Pb; Aim 2 – to elucidate
later life and cross generational fitness consequences of developmental exposures to PAHs and subsequent Cd
or Pb exposure and determine links to epigenetic modifications; Aim 3 – to compare the gut microbiome
differences in PAH-resistant and sensitive fish, and elucidate the potential contributions of the gut microbiome
on PAH resistance using germ-free killifish studies; Aim 4 – to develop an ecological-effect directed analysis
based on medium-throughput mitochondrial and behavioral assays to assess toxicity of environmental samples
including remediated samples derived in DUSRC-Project 5. Moreover, we will bi-directionally collaborate with
Project 2 (behavioral studies) and Project 3 (mitochondrial studies), focusing on aspects of experimental design
and toxicity mechanisms. We will also work closely with the community engagement core for dissemination of
our findings to the relevant communities, the data management core for experimental design, data management
and analyses, and the analytical chemistry core for chemical analyses. The project will be heavily involved in the
training of graduate students and post-doctoral researchers and will coordinate activities with the training core
as well as the admin core for overall support and research translation. Overall, studies will elucidate ecologically
relevant fitness outcomes of PAH and metal exposures and selected aspects of underlying molecular
mechanisms in killifish populations, while rendering the toxicity assays for characterizing effectiveness of
remediation. Novel areas of research include elucidating PAH and metal interactive effects, discerning the role
of the gut microbiome in PAH resistance, and developing an ecologically relevant toxicity analyses based on
killifish behavior and energetics that target Mandate 3 to inform ecological risk assessment."

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are contaminants of great concern due to their toxic, mutagenic and
carcinogenic properties that are commonly encountered at Superfund sites. Due to their chemical characteristics,
PAHs tend to be highly hydrophobic and recalcitrant, making them challenging targets for remediation. PAH-
impacted sites are also frequently enriched with toxic metals from related industries, and such mixtures require
engineering solutions that effectively target PAHs while minimizing deleterious environmental impacts on co-
contaminants. Treatments in multi-contaminant settings are particularly challenging because bioremediation
strategies aimed at PAHs can introduce environmental conditions such as oxic microniches that may enhance
the leaching potential and bioavailability of metals. Because of these challenges, site managers often resort to
drastic remediation approaches such as soil excavation or dredging, which can have significant negative long-
term impacts on local ecosystems. In situ bioremediation has been widely studied as an alternative approach
with minimal ecological disruption. During the last funding period, we developed a generalizable framework for
the precision bioremediation of PAHs that harnesses in situ cross-kingdom microbial interactions. We created a
library of fungal and bacterial strains that could work cooperatively to breakdown PAHs. Yet, while strain selection
is a pivotal decision to be made for the effectiveness of the amended microbes, the observed transience of some
augmented strains after inoculation can significantly reduce the long-term effectiveness of bioremediation. Thus,
a particular challenge that remains to be solved is the long-term survival and activity of augmented exogenous
strains under complex site conditions. Herein, we propose to address this challenge by developing microbial
encapsulation delivery vehicles that enable targeted delivery and increased fitness of key microbial strains for
the implementation of precision bioremediation. The permeability of the microcapsule, alongside the protective
separation of the internal organisms from the external environment, makes microcapsules attractive for
deployment to natural environments and for the implementation of precision bioremediation. We hypothesize
that the use of microcapsules will improve delivery, viability and fitness of the augmented microbes thereby
improving PAH biodegradation. The specific aims for this project are to: 1) Optimize microcapsule synthesis for
delivery to soil and sediment sites, sorption of target PAHs, and growth/function of encapsulated microbes; 2)
Develop site-specific encapsulated microbial consortia of PAH degraders and compare to pure cultures for PAH
degradation; and 3) Investigate unintended impacts of the microencapsulated bioaugmentation strategy through
evaluation of PAH degradation products and geochemical transformations of co-contaminant metals in
Superfund-relevant conditions. Ultimately, this project will yield field translatable approaches for the
bioremediation of PAHs at Superfund sites with co-contaminants."

The Duke University Superfund Research Center (DUSRC) aims to understand and address major public health
problems related to early-life co-exposure to hazardous contaminants and neurodevelopmental outcomes. The
Administrative and Research Translation Core (ARTC) of the DUSRC will provide holistic support of the
organized whole and promote integration of the constituent parts. The ARTC will be the formal and central
framework for support, oversight, and planning for the DUSRC’s research, events and activities. As such, the
ARTC will: facilitate central planning and coordination; provide fiscal oversight and guidance to ensure
compliance with institutional and federal regulations; leverage our stakeholder and partnership networks to
engage key stakeholders beyond the DUSRC; communicate needs-driven research and facilitate effective
research application; facilitate and promote the transfer of technology from Center Investigators to relevant
audiences; and build Center investigator and trainee capacity for timely and effective science communication
and research translation. The ARTC will employ a matrix structure for assimilation of this information and the
dissemination of research findings among Center Investigators, students, researchers and staff via monthly
Center-wide research discussion meetings, trainee chalk talks, weekly seminars and bi-annual symposia, annual
External Advisory Committee meeting, and consistent biweekly internal meetings of the ARTC PIs and staff. The
organizational plan of the Center consists of direct reporting lines from Project and Core PIs to the Center’s
Director, Dr. Heather Stapleton, and Deputy Director, Dr. Richard Di Giulio, and research translation efforts will
be supervised by Dr. Charlotte Clark. Through evaluation of annual milestones and success metrics, ARTC
management of the DUSRC will support a seamless systems approach to research with discovery across
projects and cores tightly coupled to accelerate progress; bidirectional communication with stakeholders;
avoidance of overdrafts and carry-overs on a regular basis; timely SRP data updates; timely NIH CareerTrac
database updates; timely online resource updates and production of translational material in support of
stakeholders and end users; and finally, trainees who receive high-impact, interdisciplinary environmental health
workforce training."

The Duke University Superfund Research Center (DUSRC) will examine the neurodevelopmental health impacts
of early-life co-exposures to PAHs and metals. The overall function of the Analytical Chemistry Core (ACC) is
to provide routine sample analysis of Superfund-relevant contaminants as well as biomarkers of exposure for
Research Projects within the DUSRC. Furthermore, the ACC provides analytical expertise in identifying
transformation products and/or metabolites of these Superfund contaminants using high-resolution mass
spectrometry techniques. The ACC has been an essential component of DUSRC over the past funding period,
including the development of new analytical protocols for organic and inorganic compounds and the analysis of
more than 2,000 samples for a wide variety of analytes (e.g., flame retardants, organophosphate pesticides,
PAHs, and trace metals) in biological and environmental samples. Progress has been made in applying high-
resolution mass spectrometry and other methods for non-targeted and effects-directed analysis of novel
contaminants and transformation products of Superfund-relevant chemicals in environmental and biological
media. Here, we propose to continue and extend the activities of the ACC, with a focus on targeted analysis of
PAHs, metals, neurotransmitter biomarkers in biological and environmental samples as well as non-targeted and
transformation product analysis of PAH compounds. In addition, we propose an increased role for the ACC to
coordinate cross-project collaborations through the analysis of complex environmental mixtures (e.g., leachates
of house dust, PAH biodegradation products) that will be generated by Projects 1 and 5, and shared to Project
2, 3, and 4 for evaluation of toxicity potential. The ACC will engage with the Research Experience and Training
Core by leading training and consulting activities related to analytical chemistry. The ACC team will also offer
informal hands-on instruction for training on sample preparation methods and instrumental analyses. We
anticipate that these interactions will help guide researchers on experimental design for their research activities
that will require chemical analyses. Finally, we will leverage our expertise to develop analytical methods and
perform analyses of other Superfund-relevant compounds that may emerge during the experimentation of
complex mixtures and study at Superfund sites. These activities will draw on our considerable success to date
in developing, validating, and applying methods for contaminant analysis in environmental and biological
samples."

Environmental health science problems posed by chemical exposure are complex; addressing these problems
successfully requires expertise from diverse scientific fields. The Duke University Superfund Research Center
(DUSRC) focuses on research and problem-solving in the context of early-life exposures and co-exposures,
later-life consequences, environmental justice, and site remediation. Cross-disciplinary training can enable the
transdisciplinary research required to solve such problems. Likewise, communicating science is challenging for
many scientists, and historically much environmental health science work has been done in the absence of
interaction with affected communities. To support trainees in DUSRC work and in preparing themselves for future
environmental science and health careers, the Research Experience and Training Coordination Core (RETCC)
of the DUSRC provides cross-disciplinary training to trainees to enable them to carry out and
communicate integrated, transdisciplinary, problem-oriented research.
The RETCC will provide a flexible and rigorous program characterized by two complementary Aims. First, all
trainees will participate in a core set of activities that will ensure proficiency in fundamental knowledge and skills
(Aim 1). Second, all trainees will be guided in choosing individually-tailored training activities to provide depth
and specificity to career and research field development (Aim 2). These components have been carefully
designed to complement the training components of the other departments and programs with which our trainees
are associated, including social, biomedical, engineering, and statistical environmental sciences, thus ensuring
that the cross-disciplinary training we provide is complemented by in-depth, focused disciplinary rigor.
Specific Aim 1. Provide training in common, fundamental cross-disciplinary knowledge and skills related to
environmental health and environmental science and engineering. Required participation in these five activities
creates a solid, broad base of cross-disciplinary knowledge and skills for all trainees, stimulates transdisciplinary
research, and promotes community among all DUSRC members.
Specific Aim 2. Provide structure and activities that facilitate scientific depth and personalized career
development. To complement the broad exposure and proficiencies that all trainees will attain under Aim 1, we
will provide a flexible menu of opportunities that will be tailored to the goals and needs of each trainee. Of
significance in our renewal application is the redesign of our “mentored mentoring” program, now explicitly
designed to promote collaboration of our trainees with undergraduates of diverse backgrounds and encourage
engagement of unrepresented minorities in DUSRC research and cores.
As in the last funding cycle, we expect to support 5-7 trainees per year, with an approximate distribution of 75%
PhD students, 20% postdoctoral researchers, and 5% Master’s students."

Approximately 20% of reproductive age women are affected by infertility, with a shocking one third of all cases
considering idiopathic, or “unexplained”. Diminished function of the mammalian ovarian reserve is one potential
cause of infertility, as it is a finite and non-renewable population of the female gametes (“oocytes”)
representing the entire reproductive capacity of a female. These cells also support the endocrine function of
the ovary, with their premature depletion resulting in an inability to conceive, as well as other features of aging
including an increased risk of ischemia, and overall shorter lifespan. Therefore, understanding and preserving
this essential population is critical for female fertility, longevity and quality of life.
The goals of this proposal are founded upon our single cell sequencing work elucidating novel regulators of
ovarian reserve establishment. We identified deubiquitinating enzyme Ubiquitin C-Terminal Hydrolase-L1
(UCHL1) as highly enriched in mouse and human oocytes during ovarian reserve formation, eventually
achieving a steady-state level of expression through later-stage follicle development. Furthermore, we can
detect and measure secreted UCHL1 in mouse and human serum, as well as human follicular fluid, suggesting
additional paracrine and endocrine signaling roles for UCHL1. Indeed, female mice that lack UCHL1
expression are severely sub-fertile, with morphologically abnormal oocytes, defects in folliculogenesis, and
apparent systemic endocrine dysfunction. Our preliminary data also suggest deficits in the ability of UCHL1
deficient oocytes to properly form the zona pellucida and express gap junction proteins. Therefore, we
hypothesize that UCHL1 is required for oocyte quality via regulation of zona pellucida protein turnover and
assembly, and therefore oocyte-granulosa cell communication as well as systemic endocrine function.
This proposal vastly expands upon our initial work to characterize the role of UCHL1 in maintaining oocyte
quality as well in regulating ovarian proteostasis and ubiquitin dynamics (Aim 1). We will also elucidate the
tissue-specific roles of UCHL1, including how oocyte-specific UCHL1 affects ovarian development,
reproductive lifespan and may act in a paracrine manner to promote ovarian somatic cell health and overall
endocrine function (Aim 2). These studies will achieve three goals: 1) determine the role of UCHL1 in
maintaining oocyte quality through regulation of zona pellucida and gap junction formation 2) comprehensively
test the effects of oocyte-specific UCHL1 loss on granulosa cell health and systemic endocrine function, and 3)
conclusively elucidate the role of oocyte-expressed UCHL1 in regulating female reproductive lifespan, oocyte
and granulosa cell proteostasis, and ovarian gene expression programs. This proposal will not only help us
better understand the unique oocyte- and granulosa-cell-specific functions of potentially master regulator of
ovarian function, UCHL1, but also will help us refine our understanding of the critical roles of proteostasis in
female reproductive health, as well as the interdependence between overall ovarian health and oocyte quality."

The Human Rights Campaign just declared a national state of emergency for lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) Americans in response to over 75 bills being signed into law that restrict the
rights of this population, including bans to gender affirming healthcare. Denial of healthcare due to
discrimination and lack of provider knowledge of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) health remain high in
healthcare settings. To reduce such barriers to healthcare and known health disparities affecting TGD people,
it is imperative to provide up-to-date knowledge on TGD-affirming care according to the World Professional
Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care Version 8 (SOC-8). Nurses are uniquely
suited to provide TGD-affirming care to patients as they are the largest healthcare profession. Currently,
nursing programs and faculty are woefully underprepared to provide students training on TGD-affirming
healthcare practices. To address these educational deficits, our aims are to 1) Create Trans*forming Care: A
7-Module Program Experience, which is a multi-pronged online learning curriculum for nursing students based
on essential components of TGD healthcare utilizing the WPATH SOC-8, community partner relationships,
empirical research, and subject matter experts; 2) Establish the validity of the online learning curriculum in
addressing healthcare needs of TGD as identified by community partners, subject matter experts, and WPATH
SOC-8; 3) Evaluate the short-term impact of the curriculum on nursing student knowledge, skills, attitudes and
connections within TGD healthcare. This multi-phase study will leverage multi-method data to create and
evaluate the Trans*forming Care Program. The Trans*forming Care program will be created through focus
groups and expert validity, as well as utilize an innovative platform to improve nursing students’ knowledge,
skills, attitudes, and connections of TGD patients. Specifically, we will establish face and content validity
through qualitative methods working closely with our subject matter experts (Phase 1) – followed by a
quantitative evaluation of nursing students' knowledge, skills, attitudes, and connections to TGD patients both
pre and post completion of the Trans*forming Care program. The Trans*forming Care program supports the
strategic plan and research lenses of the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR). These five areas
include 1) health equity, 2) social determinants of health, 3) prevention and health promotion, 4) systems and
models of care, and 5) population and community health. Additionally, this project is ideally suited for this R25
as it will enhance the knowledge of health professionals on influences to health and disease that are present
for TGD individuals. We anticipate this open-source continuing education program to become a model for
TGD-affirming healthcare in nursing schools across the country, leading to improved health outcomes for TGD
people."

 The Kansas IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (K-INBRE) is a statewide network of
universities in Kansas and Oklahoma that work cooperatively to improve biomedical research. The University of
Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) is the Lead Institution and works closely with two other non-primarily
undergraduate institutions (non-PUIs: University of Kansas-Lawrence, KU-L; Kansas State University, KSU;)
and seven institutions focused on undergraduate student training PUIs: Emporia State University (ESU), Fort
Hays State University (FHSU), Haskell Indian Nations University (HINU), Langston University (LU, Langston,
OK), Pittsburg State University (PSU), Washburn University (WU), and Wichita State University (WSU).
 The K-INBRE is focused on 1) developing a skilled, competitive Kansas workforce in biomedical
research, 2) increasing undergraduate research participation, and 3) the power of mentored team science. The
long-range objectives are to promote multidisciplinary research networks in biomedical research; increase the
research base and capacity through research support; provide research opportunities for trainees; serve as a
pipeline for students to continue health research careers; and enhance science and technology knowledge of
data science in the K-INBRE community.
 To achieve the objectives of the K-INBRE, the proposal contains key elements within three Specific Aims
and three Cores. Aim 1 seeks to strengthen research capacity and infrastructure. The K-INBRE Administrative
Core oversees all K-INBRE functions and includes the Incentives & Awards Committee and the Student
Research Program. The Administrative Core focuses on network communications, scholarship, and internal
evaluations. Aim 2, through its Data Science Core, enhances science and technology knowledge by offering
research support and education. Aim 3 stimulates Kansas's basic, translational, and entrepreneurial research
via mentored, interdisciplinary research opportunities. The Developmental Research Project Program (DRPP)
Core oversees the Developmental Research Project Program, SPRING Pilot Projects, and Postdoctoral Awards.
The K-INBRE continues to refine and expand our efforts in biomedical research within the K-INBRE network.
New innovations include implementing programs targeted to PUIs (CURE awards, SPRING Pilot Projects, DRPP
awards, and Data Science Research awards for PUI faculty (DSC-PUI Awards). Collectively, these mechanisms
allow K-INBRE network faculty and trainees to engage in biomedical research at different stages and increase

 The Kansas INBRE (K-INBRE) network proposes an Administrative Core to oversee the operations of
the K-INBRE program. The long-range objective for the Administrative Core is to provide leadership, oversight,
financial and reporting duties, and manage the evaluation components of the K-INBRE program. In addition, this
Administrative Core houses two critical components of the K-INBRE program: oversight and decision-making of
the funding selections (Incentives & Awards Committee) and oversight, tracking, and scholarship associated with
undergraduate research opportunities (Student Research Program). Our purposes are to provide professional
oversight to maintain this long-standing and highly functional IDeA program and to expand and integrate with
existing educational and training programs operating the K-INBRE Network. The Administrative Core will function
through the following 3 Aims: 1) provide administrative oversight to the overall K-INBRE program, 2) provide
oversight and assistance to the two working committees in the Administrative Core, and 3) leverage K-INBRE
resources to integrate with existing Kansas programs and increase research support through administrative
supplements.
 A strength of the K-INBRE Administrative Core is the longstanding continuity and success of the
experienced leadership and administrative personnel. The primary functions of the Administrative Core continue
to adjust to meet all compliance requirements for NIH. The Incentives & Awards Committee oversees decisions
on funding and supervision of all awards within the K-INBRE. The Student Research Program supports
biomedical research experiences for undergraduates on K-INBRE network campuses. This Student Research
Program will oversee programs directed by the 9 Campus Coordinators to attract and retain promising students
into biomedically-related science majors and involve these students in cutting-edge research, assist in the
implementation of student-focused symposia and workshops, and supervise the award of funds to support in
unique undergraduate training opportunities. An innovation for the current iteration of the K-INBRE is a new
funding mechanism to increase support to primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) for undergraduate research

opportunities. The DRPP Core will execute and oversee three mentored training programs, including the
Developmental Research Project Program (DRPP), the Summer PUI Research INvestigator Grant (SPRING)
Pilot Projects, and the Postdoctoral Awards. All three funding mechanisms will promote the development of
multidisciplinary research projects in the area of biomedical research, with the specific focus of 1) providing
young faculty with the skills to acquire independent funding 2) aiding PUI faculty to grow research programs
primarily in the summer, with the inclusion of undergraduate research opportunities, and 3) supporting promising
postdoctoral fellows as they develop tools and skills to advance in their careers. The Program Coordinator will
be the principal lead, providing oversight, feedback, and evaluation to all DRPP awardees. The DRPP awards
support new faculty engaged in interdisciplinary developmental research projects and require 6 CYM effort.
Faculty members will be identified and supported for a standalone project in collaboration with an engaged
primary mentor selected for each awardee, and the DRPP Core will identify and evaluate milestones specific to
each project. DRPP awards will be available at both non-PUIs and PUIs, and the inclusion of undergraduate
research will be encouraged. Progress will be monitored closely by the DRPP Core Director in conjunction with
the mentor, and funding for the 2nd year will be contingent upon adequate progress in the 1st year. DRPP
awardees will be required to identify an IDeA collaborator, allowing them to develop team science and enhance
their chances for additional funding through administrative supplements. The SPRING Pilot Projects is a new
funding mechanism to stimulate research by PUI faculty during the summer months. Support will cover summer
salary, research supplies, undergraduate students, or research technicians. Three CYM are required for SPRING
grants. The Postdoctoral Awards partially support promising postdoctoral fellows at non-PUIs as they create an
interdisciplinary research project and acquire leadership skills that will help promote their independence as new
investigators. The DRPP Core will aid in pursuing additional funding and help investigators develop grant
applications to all DRPP awardees from NIH and other federal funding sources. These awards provide financial
support to laboratories, educate and ensure training in grant-writing skills, and ensure excellent mentoring during
the critical step of developing research careers. The DRPP Core will seek to grow research programs in young
faculty and faculty at K-INBRE PUI institutions to increase the number of students involved in research."

Here we launch an international initiative to understand Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD), using a novel
tractometry approach for fine-scale mapping of the brain’s microstructure. Up to 80% of the 8.5 million people
diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD) worldwide will develop dementia within a decade of diagnosis, with
devastating consequences for everyday functioning, caregiver burden, and heightened morbidity and mortality.
In addition to the immense personal toll of dementia in PD, the economic burden of PD in North America will
exceed $37 billion by 2037. Symptomatic treatments are available, but no disease modifying therapeutics exist,
making PD a lifelong, incurable disorder. Recent innovations in imaging - by us and others - reveal early
microstructural changes in brain white matter (WM); their progression is strongly associated with dementia onset
and with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in people living with PD. Even so, prior PDD studies are plagued by
small sample sizes, low statistical power, poor replication, and findings whose generalizability and reliability is
unknown. With so many studies assessing so few patients, there is a pressing need to integrate international
data to achieve samples with the statistical power to detect prognostic markers in PDD. To address this, we
launch a global initiative with unprecedented power to understand what leads to dementia in PD - what are the
primary risk factors, and what processes in the brain are progressing in those who develop dementia in PD
versus those who do not. Building on our pilot data that merged global data in an internationally coordinated
analysis of diffusion tensor images from 1,654 individuals with PD and 885 controls from 17 sites in 9
countries, our work will reveal how WM microstructure deteriorates as dementia develops in PD, which WM
pathways show changes associated with dementia, and which individuals diagnosed with PD are most likely to
progress to dementia. We deploy - on a global scale - our novel tractometry method, Bundle Analytics (BUAN),
to map fine-scale microstructural alterations in PD-related dementia, and its precursor, PD with MCI (N=3,539
participants scanned with MRI). Our Specific Aims are to: (1) Create an age-dependent statistical reference
model for WM microstructure in the brain's fiber bundles throughout adult life; (2) Identify along-tract
microstructural biomarkers of PDD; and (3) predict decline to dementia from PD with MCI, identifying
which subjects will progress to dementia is crucial for personalized treatment planning. To boost predictive
accuracy, we will merge global data on vascular disease assessed with FLAIR imaging, based on pilot work that
revealed in patients with PD-MCI that WMH volume was associated with PD dementia conversion. Overall, we
hypothesize that tractometry and FLAIR imaging will each add significant prognostic value relative to the baseline
clinical data alone; by identifying which neuroimaging data predict future decline, our study will guide future data
collection, by identifying which kinds of neuroimaging data are most valuable to collect, and for which patients."

Recent advances in HIV Prevention science include the demonstration of PreP efficacy of the long acting
injectable Cabotegravir and broadly neutralizing antibodies against sensitive strains. Likewise, there have
been advances in HIV vaccine science with novel immunogens, adjuvants, and delivery strategies that are
increasing the immune responses to the virus and their ability to prevent systemic infection. However, the
fine tuning of these preventative interventions and our ability to increase their potency require a better
understanding of the mechanisms of HIV sexual transmission. The primary focus of this project has been
on 1) developing and optimizing methods allowing the identification of the first cells infected after a
mucosal challenge; 2) the characterization of the expanding foci of infection, and 3) the definition of the
cascade of events that takes place during the eclipse phase as the virus disseminates before detectable
viremia. This project has uniquely impacted and advanced our understanding of the detailed natural history
of the virus in the first 4 days after mucosal challenge. This success is a consequence of the innovative
approach of beacon-guided necropsy where a signal is generated by the presence of infected cells. The
first version of this technique utilized luciferase expressed by a replication defective dual-reporter vector.
However, we have developed the next generation of this approach, which uses 64Cu labeled FAB2 probes
specific for the SIV envelope protein and PET/CT as next generation beacon-guided necropsy. This
approach is highly sensitive and efficient allowing the unbiased identification of multiple foci within the
same animal at the whole-body level including the characterization of the interactions of the virus with host
innate and inflammatory responses. The study of small foci of infection during the eclipse phase after
transmission reveals a complex crosstalk between different infected cells and local tissue environment,
which can vary in different areas and tissues within the same animal. This and other observations reveal
target cell susceptibility, rather than the “tropism” of the viral envelope, is the key driver of early infection. It
is clear that the local anatomy and physiology of virus exposed mucosal tissue has a major impact on the
natural history of the virus during the eclipse phase. Through the interrogation of small tissue blocks
containing replication foci, we will define the who, where, and when of early mucosal infection, including
which cells are generating virus specific alarms and which cells are responding to these alarms. This will
be accomplished by incorporating new approaches for the identification of cells migrating into the infected
tissue site, restriction of cell mobilization, the disruption of pathways involved in innate and inflammatory
responses, and short and long term responses within the infected tissues. Advancing the goals and focus
of this project will result in a substantial increase in our understanding of the earliest cascade events in
vaginal and rectal transmission. In turn, clarifying this process, and the impact of local anatomy and
physiology on virus expansion and dissemination, will clearly advance HIV prevention science."

This application requests funds to continue a training program in auditory and vestibular
neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh. Resources to support three predoctoral and two
postdoctoral trainees per year are requested. While considerable progress has been made in
identifying the genetic and molecular bases of inner ear deficits, the biological bases of
centrally-generated hearing and balance disorders, which are increasingly recognized as major
contributors to auditory and vestibular dysfunction, are still poorly understood. The proposed
program is intended to generate auditory and vestibular scientists who can address these
problems, through training in basic neuroscience and the clinical aspects of hearing and
balance disorders. A group of 17 preceptors who are committed to auditory and vestibular
neuroscience research and to recruit and educate outstanding pre- and postdoctoral fellows will
comprise the training faculty. The research methodology employed by the preceptors ranges
from cellular and molecular to developmental to systems and cognition using a variety of model
systems, including humans, ensuring that trainees are exposed to the breadth and variety of
technical and conceptual approaches that define modern research in the field. In addition to
conducting research, trainees participate in a course covering basic and translational auditory
and vestibular neuroscience, attend monthly research seminars, and participate in a series of
professional development workshops that provide explicit training in such “survival skills” as
written and oral communication, obtaining jobs and grants, teaching, and managing a research
lab. All trainees must submit a fellowship application as part of the program, the writing of which
will be facilitated by periodic meetings with a local committee that provides advice and
guidance, as well as utilizing grant-writing workshops provided by the Office of Academic
Career Development. Training in the responsible scientific conduct and scientific rigor is an
integral part of professional development workshops, the core curriculum, and laboratory
training. A solid structure is in place to mentor the trainees and monitor their progress through
the program. The program is supported by a local steering committee and an external advisory
board."

Auditory experience can reshape cortical maps and transform receptive field properties of neurons in the
auditory cortex of the adult animal. The exact form of this plasticity depends on the behavioral context, and the
spectrotemporal features of the salient acoustic stimuli. This has been shown by combined physiological and
behavioral approaches in our previous experiments in which spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) were
rapidly and comprehensively characterized simultaneous with the animal behavior. The experiments also
contrasted plasticity in single cells across different auditory tasks employing various acoustic signals with
controlled spectral and temporal features. These results are consistent with findings of adaptive plasticity in the
motor and other sensory systems and support the hypothesis that auditory cortical cells may undergo rapid,
context-dependent changes of their receptive field properties when an animal is engaged in different auditory
behavioral tasks. This kind of plasticity would likely involve a selective functional reshaping of the underlying
cortical circuitry to sculpt the most effective receptive field for accomplishing the current auditory task. During
the last 5 years, we explored how this plasticity manifested itself in the dPEG and VPr fields of the ferret
auditory cortex. In this grant period, we hope to complete the characterization of this plasticity and also
examine its role in two important cognitive functions: Categorization and Encoding of Sequences. We shall
conduct our physiological experiments with dense arrays of planar and laminar multielectrode arrays, as well
as functional Ultrasound imaging to gain a view of the global distribution of neuronal activity during and after
training These experiments will lead to progress in understanding the interactions within an extended neuronal
network covering most of the auditory posterior cortical fields in the ferret which give rise to adaptive plasticity."

between laboratories focused on vascular, gastrointestinal, immune, and musculoskeletal systems and those
focused on neurophysiology, neuromodulation, and neural injury. Traditionally, departments are organized by
organ system and this siloed structure leads to a physical and scientific jargon separation, impeding collaboration
and training. Hence, our understanding of how the central nervous system communicates with end organs
throughout the body is in its infancy. Neural Control of Organ Degeneration and Regeneration (NeuralCODR), a
cross-disciplinary training program unites 30 faculty members and 12 clinician researchers to form mentorship
teams within the largest medical research center in the world (Texas Medical Center). Mentorship teams include
a primary and secondary mentor (each from one of our three main areas of research: 1) neural development and
tools, 2) neural innervation and organ engineering, and 3) nervous system and peripheral organ disorders) and
a clinical mentor who provides much needed and rare exposure to real-world diseases, clinical challenges, and
human samples. NeuralCODR aims to: 1) catalyze the collision of talent and ideas that spawn research projects
bridging neuroscience with organ systems through facilitated interactions, 2) build co-mentor teams that include
neuroscience, organ systems, and clinical perspectives, ensuring trainees are guided toward a unique research
niche, and 3) train fellows in research rigor, analysis, and career skills that support their development as scientific
leaders. NeuralCODR leverages a network of faculty who collaborate on projects that bridge the gap between
organ system biology and engineering and neural function, degeneration and regeneration, as evidenced by an
impressive list of multi-laboratory shared grants, publications, and nascent collaborations. The training structure
emphasizes experiences in organ engineering and organ physiology laboratories in parallel with education in
neurophysiology and neural engineering, translational theory, and practice. Currently, two NeuralCODR Houston
Methodist-specific postdoctoral positions exist, thanks to a philanthropic endowment that has allowed us to build
the program structure and to test both the coursework and mentorship team concept. Trainees are funded for
two years, during which time they have access to a core curriculum, career development and program
enrichment opportunities, symposiums/retreats, and elective courses. Year one culminates with the submission
of an NRSA and a manuscript based on trainees’ development of a transformative research project that
incorporates non-neuroscience expertise and tools into a neuroscience problem. Year two solidifies the
relationships between the mentorship team and trainee and provides training in laboratory management, didactic
teaching, and mentorship skills. T32 funding will allow us to increase the current model to six postdoctoral training
slots. This training program will foster a new generation of scientific leaders who pioneer research on the
connected pathways between brain and organ systems to solve fundamental challenges in neuroscience."
10880335,"Title: Precision editing of neural circuits using engineered electrical synapses
Pioneering approaches including optogenetics and designer receptors exclusively activated by
designer drugs (DREADDs) enable the direct modulation of the activity of individual genetically
defined cell types. Nevertheless, it remains a fundamental challenge to selectively regulate the
hallmark feature of neural circuits: the interface between two specific brain cells. To address this
challenge, we have created a new approach, Long-term integration of circuits using Connexins
(LinCx), that employs a novel pair of engineered connexin hemichannels to directly modulate
genetically defined neural circuits. When each member of the hemichannel pair is expressed in
two different cell(s)/cell-types that compose a circuit, they engage in heterotypic docking
(docking with each other) and an electrical synapse is constituted between the two cells. These
pair of hemichannels is engineered 1) to prevent them from engaging in homotypic docking
(forming electrical synapses with themselves), and 2) to disrupt them from docking with other
connexin hemichannels endogenously expressed in the mammalian brain. Finally, 3) the
hemichannel pair exhibits rectification. Together, these three properties confer LinCx with
unprecedented spatial-, temporal-, and context precision, enabling the precise editing of neural
circuits.
We propose to deploy LinCx across model organisms. We will determine the impact of LinCx
neuromodulation on neural circuit physiology and emotional behavior. We will also test whether
LinCx modulation is sufficient to restore normal behavior in animal models of psychiatric
disorders. Successful completion of these high-risk experiments will yield a new method for
long-term circuit editing to regulate emotional states in preclinical models. In the future, LinCx
can be integrated with emerging viral tools that enable systemic delivery of genetically encoded
proteins to specific brain cell-types. Thus, LinCx also has an attainable path to human
translation for ameliorating devastating psychiatric disorders."

Suicide is a leading cause of death that continues to increase, with over 47,000 preventable suicide deaths per
year in the U.S. Although we have made great strides in using electronic health records (EHR) and other
factors to predict suicidal ideation and behavior, our ability to reliably predict suicide death is close to zero.
From a healthcare standpoint, predicting suicide deaths is tricky. We know that the incidence of suicide
behaviors is far more common (~4%-5% per year) compared to suicide death (~0.01%-0.02% per year).
Essentially, only a small fraction of those who engage in suicidal behaviors will go on to die by suicide.
Knowledge of who these highest risk individuals are is critically important in directing prevention efforts and
development of future targeted interventions. In addition, well over half of suicide deaths occur with no prior
attempts, even accounting for lack of documentation of attempts in diagnostic codes. These “out of the blue”
cases suggest one or more high-risk groups even more elusive to accurate prediction and prevention.
Including genetic data of suicide deaths may offer substantial predictive improvement; genetic factors account
for close to 50% of the risk of suicide death. Using the extensive genetic data, statewide longitudinal EHR
resources, demographic, and familial data available to the Utah Suicide Genetic Risk Study (USGRS), we are
uniquely poised to address this critical knowledge gap. Our primary focus will be to use machine learning
methods develop models that predict suicide deaths. In addition, our large suicide death research resource will
also allow us to model differences of suicide deaths with vs. without prior attempts. Of the ~9,000 Utah suicide
deaths with demographics and environmental data, familial data, and 2 decades of longitudinal EHR data, the
USGRS also currently has DNA from >6,000, which will increase to ~10,000 during the award period. Genome-
wide molecular data is in hand for over 5,000 of these Utah suicides, allowing for tests of association of suicide
subtypes identified using EHR data with “genetic phenotypes” represented by polygenic risk scores. The
USGRS also has demographics, familial data, and longitudinal EHR data from 5 age/sex- matched Utah
population controls for each suicide death, allowing for comparisons of non-lethal attempts to suicide deaths. In
addition, we will collaborate with colleagues at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, who are currently
developing EHR and polygenic risk models to study substance use disorder, anxiety, and major depressive
disorder in 37,510 participants in the Mount Sinai BioMe Biorepository. They will expand this work to include
suicidality to provide an additional resource of suicide attempt for our model development and testing. We will
additionally study polygenic risk scores associated with suicide death vs. attempt using our resources, Mount
Sinai BioMe, and a collaboration with Vanderbilt University for access to their Biobank and to suicide attempts
in the UK Biobank.. Independent validation will be possible through genotyping of new Utah suicides collected
throughout the project, with additional comparisons to attempt cases in large datasets available through the
PsychEMERGE consortium."
10880373,"ABSTRACT: Tobacco use is the single greatest preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United
States, accounting for 480,000 deaths and $300 billion in attributable costs annually. One quarter of all
smokers are seen at their child’s primary care office and may not have a primary care doctor of their own.
When parents quit smoking, their life expectancy is increased by over 10 years, future tobacco-related poor
pregnancy outcomes are avoided, children have a four-fold lower risk of becoming smokers, the family has
more money for necessities, and children are less likely to suffer diseases caused by tobacco smoke exposure
(TSE). Routinely delivered tobacco control assistance to parents in the pediatric setting would provide a major
health benefit to the nation. Our previous systems change efforts using the Clinical Effort Against Secondhand
Smoke Exposure (CEASE) intervention to identify parents who smoke, deliver nicotine replacement therapy,
and enroll them in the quitline have shown significant improvements in pediatric practice uptake and parent
outcomes. However, the CEASE intervention has faced barriers, such as reliance on parental self-report of
TSE, which underestimates childhood exposure, and variable provider adherence to delivering parental
cessation assistance. Children who live with smokers are exposed to secondhand and thirdhand tobacco
smoke, and potentially to aerosol from parents who use electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). Routinely
screening children’s blood for cotinine, a biomarker of nicotine exposure, could reliably identify children with
TSE exposure. Extant lead screening programs, already part of pediatric healthcare delivery, provide an
obvious, yet currently untapped opportunity to screen for cotinine at well-child visits. Routine cotinine
measurement in children using blood already collected for lead testing can institutionalize management of TSE
in a comparable fashion. Results from objective cotinine testing could be used to motivate both providers and
parents to promote tobacco control and cessation activities. Our preliminary qualitative and quantitative work
suggests this approach is feasible, acceptable, and effective. We hypothesize that providing cotinine biomarker
results to pediatricians, personalized cotinine feedback to parents about their child’s toxin exposure, and
offering support to all household tobacco users to quit tobacco use (Biomarker Informed Outreach (BIO)) when
added to the CEASE intervention will increase delivery of tobacco cessation assistance, increase household
cessation, reduce TSE in children, and be cost-effective. We propose a 2-arm RCT conducted in five pediatric
practices, enrolling children and parents at the child’s 1-year well child visit. The enrolled subjects will be
randomized to either CEASE+BIO or CEASE arms. To compare the effectiveness of CEASE+BIO vs. CEASE,
we will follow-up with enrolled parents at the 2-year well child visit to assess parental quit rate and children’s
TSE. Trial results could lead to universal documentation of TSE and trigger more effective tobacco cessation
support for the group of young adult parents who live with, expose, and influence the next generation."

How experience influences the formation of neural circuits during mammalian development remains among the
most fascinating questions confronting developmental neurobiologists. Over the past 50 years, studies of
vision-dependent circuitry forming in the binocular visual cortex in carnivores, non-human primates and the
mouse has led to a deep appreciation of this phenomenon. New technological developments, including the
imaging of neural activity of individual cells in awake behaving animals, single cell labeling and transcriptomics,
and large-scale electrophysiology, has opened the door to revisit classic questions in the field by tracking the
development of individual neurons and cell types. In a series of recent studies, we established that visual
experience soon after eye opening most profoundly shapes the development and refinement of cortical
responses to the ipsilateral eye and that this experience-dependent plasticity sets the upper limit on binocular
acuity. The locus of plasticity in the circuitry of primary visual cortex, and the role played by inhibition, remain
unknown. The goal of this proposal is to systematically interrogate the visual pathway from thalamus to cortex
and within cortex to gain a mechanistic understanding of how visual experience informs the establishment of
cortical responses to the ipsilateral eye and, thus, binocular vision. There are three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we
will examine the development of the thalamocortical projection to V1 in layer 2/3 and 4 for both eyes. We will
determine whether there are laminar differences in this organization as a function of eye and visual experience.
In Aim 2, we will examine how this geniculate input is integrated by recipient cortical neurons. We will
determine if there are differences in this integration for ipsilateral and contralateral eye inputs to excitatory and
inhibitory neurons and whether visual experience is necessary for its establishment. And in Aim 3, we will
explore and test the role of intracortical inhibition in refining ipsilateral eye input as a function of vision. None of
these measurements have been made for binocular neurons in any species but are critically needed to obtain
an understanding of the origins of high acuity binocular vision. We envision that these studies will establish
general principles by which experience influences the development of the mammalian cortex."

Reliable, reproducible estimates of the costs of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD related dementias (ADRD) are
critical for stakeholders and decision makers to fully understand the size of the economic and financial disease
burden and to inform priority setting. Dementia cost estimates typically include medical costs and the cost of
long term services and support and some indirect costs such as the value of the time of unpaid caregivers for
persons living with dementia. Yet, dementia cost magnitude, when based on a limited set of costs, is likely a
significant underestimate of costs, particularly as it relates to costs associated with unpaid care provided by
family and friends. Time spent caregiving may result in productivity losses and future income and wealth losses.
Caregivers may experience health and quality of life impacts and medical costs associated with the challenges
of caregiving. Additionally, participation in interventions or clinical trials may impose costs to both persons living
with dementia (PLWD) and their care partners and caregivers. Vulnerability to financial and physical abuse is
more common among persons living with dementia than for persons without dementia, with important financial
and non-financial costs associated with both. We propose to provide national, annual, comprehensive cost
estimates of dementia from the societal perspective. Concurrently, we will build the infrastructure to greatly
increase national research capacity for generating reliable, reproducible cost estimates and for utilizing
innovative methods for analyzing what impacts these costs, how and for whom. We have brought together
dementia experts from across the nation and the experience in convening lived experience panels through
partnership with the Alzheimer’s Association. We will draw on the significant expertise of our multidisciplinary
team in dementia cost estimation using nationally representative survey and administrative data sources. We
will build upon decades of investment in validated and sophisticated dynamic microsimulations models for
estimates and projections of population health and spending, the Future Elderly Model (FEM) for middle age and
older US adults and the ADRD FEM for dementia estimates, and Future Adult Model (FAM) for young to middle-
aged adults. We will innovate on these models to build the U.S. Costs of Dementia Model (USCDM) that will fill
gaps in cost estimates and facilitate reproducibility and use by the research community. Utilizing accessible
platforms for data and code sharing, and a comprehensive pilot program with innovative mentoring, we will
expand the capacity of the research community to produce comprehensive, robust and replicable estimates of
the costs of dementia in the US over time, and to use dynamic microsimulation and modeling tools to quantify
how changes in population health, demographics, care models and systems, public and workplace policies, and
new treatments impact costs of dementia today and in the future."
10878785,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can act as signaling molecules mediating physiological functions in immunity,
cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Whether ROS have a major signaling function as second
messengers in axonal growth and guidance is currently unclear. The neuronal growth cone is a highly motile
structure at the tip of neuronal processes, guiding them to appropriate target cells during development and
regeneration of the nervous system. The growth cone integrates molecular information from the environment
and transduces it via multiple signaling cascades to affect underlying cytoskeletal dynamics. Whereas most
major second messenger systems have been implicated in regulating directional growth cone movement, such
a role has not been established for ROS. The present study has two major objectives focusing on ROS produced
by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-(NADPH) oxidase (Nox): (1) to determine the cellular and
molecular mechanism by which ROS control neurite growth; and (2) to determine whether ROS act as second
messengers downstream of specific guidance cues to control axonal growth and guidance. The four central
hypotheses state that (1) a physiological level of ROS is optimal and required for adhesion-mediated neurite
growth; (2) Src tyrosine kinase is a key target of ROS signaling in neuronal growth cones; (3) neuronal Nox2-derived ROS regulate axonal pathfinding; and (4) specific axon guidance cues such as slit2 control axonal
pathfinding via Nox2-derived ROS both in vitro and in vivo. This project will take advantage of two excellent
model systems to test these hypotheses: large Aplysia growth cones for quantitative live cell imaging of growth
cone motility and intracellular ROS in vitro and developing zebrafish embryos for imaging and manipulating
axonal development in vivo. In vitro growth cone guidance assays, novel fluorescent dyes and biosensors
specific for hydrogen peroxide and Src activity, respectively, advanced imaging techniques, chimeric analysis of
Nox2-deficient zebrafish lines as well as retinal ganglion cell-specific Nox2-mutant fish lines will be used to
address the following two Specific Aims: (1) The first aim is to determine the cellular and molecular mechanism
by which ROS in control neurite growth. (2) The second aim is to determine the role of neuronal Nox2 in axonal
pathfinding of retinal ganglion cells. The proposed work is highly innovative because it investigates ROS as a
novel group of signaling molecules in axonal growth and guidance and develops several new zebrafish lines
suitable for studying Nox function in the nervous system. In summary, these studies have the potential of leading
to breakthrough findings in the field of neuronal development and regeneration. Furthermore, since basic
mechanisms of axonal growth and guidance are highly conserved across species, these studies will impact the
development of antioxidant treatments for neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system injuries."

 About 30 percent of all brain tumors and central nervous system tumors are gliomas. They also comprise
80 percent of all malignant brain tumors. Glioma is a heterogeneous disease with multiple subtypes. The
neuropathological evaluation and diagnostics of brain tumor specimens are performed according to WHO
Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System: grades I, II, III and IV. Grade I biologically benign
gliomas are comparatively low risk and can be removed surgically depending on their location. Grade II low-
grade gliomas (LGGs) tend to exhibit benign tendencies, but they also have a uniform rate of recurrence and
increase in grade over time. Grade III-IV high-grade gliomas (including glioblastoma; GBM) are malignant and
carry the worst prognosis. Despite vast amounts of research, high-grade gliomas can be very difficult to treat
and most often not curative. The multimodal treatments available, like tumor excision, radiation or chemotherapy,
TTF (tumor treating fields), targeted drug therapy and immunotherapy, may slow cancer progression and reduce
signs and symptoms in order to maximize a patient’s quality of life. Still, the median survival time of patients with
high-grade gliomas is only 12–14 months.
 In the F99 phase of this project, I propose structure – function studies of two lncRNAs involved in
glioma/GBM progression: oncogenic LINC00152 and tumor suppressive DRAIC. The working hypothesis is that
lncRNAs, like proteins, have specific functional domains responsible for their activities. To investigate the
relationship between lncRNA structure and function, I propose to determine (1) the secondary structure of
LINC00152 and DRAIC using SHAPE-MaP technique and (2) the functionality of DRAIC lncRNA domains in the
context of suppression of migration and invasion, and inhibition of the NF-kB pathway. The proposed work will
open a new field of lncRNA secondary structure-function studies, which will allow faster functional description of
novel cancer-related lncRNAs and define minimal functional domains that can be used in the future for therapy.
In parallel, by interacting with scientists who are experts in those fields, I will familiarize myself with animal models
and histopathology of gliomas to prepare for the K00 phase of work.
 In the K00 phase, I will focus on how to target oncogenic long and short non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in
gliomas, and explore novel methods to deliver the minimal functional domains of the tumor suppressor ncRNAs
for glioma therapy. I will also examine how manipulating noncoding RNA structure affects an organism’s immune
response to the RNA delivery. Work performed in the F99 phase to understand key regulatory pathways
impacted by lncRNAs in gliomas will allow me in the K00 phase to design screens for chemicals that will target
these pathways, and thus help to develop novel approaches for treating gliomas."

 The effective treatment of bacterial infections of skin, deep soft tissues and wounds continues to be a
major unmet challenge in healthcare settings, especially among patients with chronic diabetes. Staphylococcus
aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common bacteria that are isolated from chronic, non-
healing wounds. Antibiotic resistance has arisen in these particular bacteria, causing these infections to
become increasingly difficult to treat and giving rise to multi-drug resistant strains, including Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
 The goal of the proposed work is to develop the next generation of antimicrobials for which the design
is inspired by a better mechanistic understanding of mammalian antimicrobial defense pathways. We focus our
attention on the antimicrobial activities of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which use histones to kill or
suppress microbial proliferation. The antimicrobial mechanism of histones has not been understood. The
Siryaporn and Gross labs recently reported that the pairing of histones with an additional component found in
NETs – the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) LL-37 (cathelicidin) – produces potent antimicrobial synergy. LL-37
forms pores in the bacterial membrane, which enable histones to enter the bacterium and interfere with gene
expression. This has an irreversible bactericidal (killing) effect on bacteria. The work proposed here will exploit
this discovery by identifying combinations of human histones and membrane-/cell wall-targeting antimicrobials
(MTAs) that produce potent antimicrobial activity and synergy. The overall objective of the project is to better
understand the mechanism of antimicrobial synergy between histones and MTAs, and to harness it to establish
a class of new therapeutics for the treatment of skin infections and wounds.
 We will accomplish this objective by identifying combinations of human histones with LL-37 and other
MTAs that produce the greatest antimicrobial activities and synergies. We will test these against S. aureus, P.
aeruginosa, and communities of skin bacteria in vitro (Aim 1). We will attempt to augment the antimicrobial
activity by engineering in factors that impact histone function in NETs, specifically chemical modification
through citrullination and tethering histones to DNA fibers (Aim 2). To validate our approach, we will test the
combinations of histones and MTAs identified in Aims 1 and 2 in a standardized mouse skin infection model
(Aim 3). To additionally address the unmet challenge of treating skin infection and wounds in diabetes patients,
we will perform the tests in a diabetic mouse model.
 The results of this work will provide a mechanistic understanding of antimicrobial synergy and develop
a strategy to combat the rise of antibiotic resistance. The results of the study could create a new class of
antimicrobial therapeutics for the treatment of skin infections and wounds in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
This would represent a game-changer in the approach to antimicrobial treatments."

Mammalian cells package two meters of linear DNA into a nucleus whose diameter is on average only a few
microns. This packaging must be done in such a way that DNA transactions such as transcription, replication,
and repair can faithfully occur. The development of the `Hi-C' technique has enabled the mapping of
chromosome-chromosome interaction frequency on the genome-wide scale in large populations of cells. Hi-
C has generated detailed datasets that have revealed key organizational features, including `domains' of
elevated interaction frequency and the broad partitioning of the genome into active and inactive
`compartments.' Disruption of these features is associated with cancer and developmental disease. However,
in part due to technical limitations, pressing open questions remain about the causes and consequences of
3D genome organization, particularly in single cells. For instance, it is not fully clear whether features such as
domains actually form in individual cells, or instead represent the averaging of many individual states that are
present in the population of cells profiled because single-cell Hi-C methods provide very sparse datasets in
which most features of genome organization remain invisible. Furthermore, the physical properties of these
genomic features have yet to be examined in single cells, and it is not currently known if these regions create
distinct diffusive environments that can impact the activity of trans-acting factors. Finally, the discovery of
additional proteins that influence nuclear architecture has been limited by the high financial and resource cost
of Hi-C. Our previous work established a powerful new platform for investigating 3D genome organization in
single cells using microscopy. We introduced a programmable fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)
approach that uses sets of bioinformatically designed oligonucleotide probes to create complex hybridization
patterns in fixed samples. We have harnessed this technology to pioneer the use of single-molecule super-
resolution microscopy to study chromosome structure on the nanoscale, introduced a technique capable of
visually distinguishing homologous chromosomes, and also have developed an approach that facilitates the
multiplexed amplification of fluorescent signals in fixed cells and tissues. We will build upon this foundational

approaches to directly address these unsolved questions. Specifically, we will introduce a broadly enabling
single-cell imaging strategy capable of resolving features of 3D genome organization with unprecedented

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a major site of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) replication, which leads to
intestinal inflammation, CD4+ T cell depletion and gut epithelial barrier dysfunction. These defects are thought
to drive HIV disease progression by allowing translocation of luminal microbial products into the circulation, which
triggers chronic systemic immune activation and disease progression. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART)
effectively suppress viral replication in the blood, it does not restore CD4+ T cell levels in the gut; even individuals
with suppressed viral loads for decades have persistent gut barrier impairment and continued microbial
translocation. Epithelial intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are responsible for replenishing the intestinal epithelium
during normal homeostatic turnover and orchestrating epithelial repair following injury. Current studies of
intestinal epithelial dysfunction in HIV are limited and have relied primarily on correlative observations based on
histology or peripheral biomarkers. Our proposal addresses critical gaps in knowledge by 1) performing in-depth
characterization of ISC proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation ex vivo and in vivo in HIV-infected and
uninfected individuals; 2) utilizing tissue samples from a unique cohort of individuals in sub-Saharan Africa,
where HIV burden is highest and most devastating; 3) applying cutting-edge techniques to uncover molecular
signalling pathways involved in HIV-induced epithelial dysfunction; and 4) thoroughly testing mechanistic
hypotheses using relevant mouse models and ex vivo organoid culture systems. With our combined expertise in
HIV disease, mucosal immunology and GI pathology, we are well positioned to uncover specific mechanisms
that underlie intestinal epithelial dysfunction in HIV infection. An understanding of these mechanisms is critical
to facilitate development of novel therapeutic approaches to improve health outcomes of people living with HIV.
In this proposal, we hypothesize that HIV infection results in hyperproliferation of ISCs, aberrant ISC
differentiation, increase epithelial death, and dysfunction of epithelial cellular junction integrity. Additionally,
based upon our data, we hypothesize that this HIV-associated ISC dysfunction can occur via two mechanisms:
1) depletion of intestinal CD4+ T cells and loss of specific T helper cytokines that promote intestinal epithelial
homeostasis and 2) type I and II interferon signalling within ISCs in HIV-infected individuals. To address these
hypotheses we are proposing two complementary aims. Aim 1 will use state-of-the-art technologies to
characterise ISC function directly ex vivo in gut pinch biopsies sampled throughout the intestinal mucosa from
our established cohort at Albert Luthuli Central Hospital in Durban, South Africa. In Aim 2 will use in vivo mouse
models of CD4+ T cell depletion and examine the impact on ISC proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation,
and use ex vivo human organoid models to study the impact of type I and II interferon pathways on ISC function.
This proposal will address important unknown mechanisms of ISC biology that may help in the development of
new strategies to reverse gut barrier defects in HIV infection."

Although immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has become a standard cancer therapy, most patients – including
~70% of those with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) – fail to respond to ICB. Accumulation of transforming
growth factor-β (TGFβ) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) can drive immune dysfunction by inducing
regulatory T cells (Tregs) and inhibiting effector CD8+ T cells, resulting in ICB resistance. However, given the
pleotropic, multifunctional nature of TGFβ, systemic inhibition has been clinically challenging with multiple side
effects. Thus, developing translatable approaches to inhibit TGFβ within the TME is of paramount importance.
Glycoprotein-A repetitions predominant (GARP), encoded by LRRC32, is a cell surface, non-signaling, docking,
and activating receptor for latent TGFβ that is highly expressed in cancer cells (including lung cancer), activated
Tregs, and platelets. We discovered that genetic deletion of Lrrc32 in Tregs or platelets enhanced protection
against mouse models of inflammation-associated colorectal cancer and colon cancer. We validated GARP as
a therapeutic target by generating a monoclonal antibody against it (called PIIO-1). PIIO-1 diminishes TGFβ
signaling in the TME specifically due to its selective ability to recognize GARP on Tregs but not platelets. To test
the translational capacity of PIIO-1, we generated a human LRRC32 knock-in mouse that globally replaces the
murine extracellular components of GARP with the human sequence – this allows us to study safety and efficacy
of PIIO-1 in murine models. We found that PIIO-1 has single agent activity against multiple cancer models and
can promote CD8+ T cell function in vivo, as evidenced by reduced CD8+ T cell exhaustion and increased CXCR3+
CD8+ T effector function in the TME. Prolonged exposure to PIIO-1 did not induce platelet-related toxicity. Finally,
we found that PIIO-1 improves therapeutic efficacy of PD-1 blockade against murine models of lung cancer.
Given these exciting discoveries, we hypothesize that disrupting the GARP-TGFβ axis within the TME using
our anti-GARP antibody PIIO-1 will augment the anti-tumor immunity of CD8+ T cells and overcome ICB
resistance in patients with NSCLC. We will test this hypothesis with the following specific aims: Aim 1. Define
how GARP inhibits CD8+ T cell differentiation programming and effector function in the TME. Aim 2. Evaluate
and characterize PIIO-1 as an immunotherapeutic agent against preclinical models of NSCLC, alone or in
combination with ICB, to support the development and initiation of a potentially best-in-class anti-GARP
antibody phase I clinical trial.
This study will address the role of our novel anti-GARP antibody in therapeutic efficacy against NSCLC and
elucidate the mechanisms by which it regulates CD8+ T cell programming and effector function. It has the
potential to overcome risks associated with systemic inhibition of TGFβ pathway and produce a novel agent for
cancer immunotherapy."

The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine was awarded for work on circadian rhythm (CR) regulation.
Now the challenge is to translate these basic science principles to clinical populations. Significant hormonal
changes during the perimenopause (P-M) may disrupt CRs, manifesting as mood, sleep and activity
dysfunction, increasing depressive illness risk. In this proposal we aim to test further a hypothesis of CR
dysregulation in P-M mood and sleep dysfunction by administering critically-timed sleep + light interventions
(SLI) designed to target and correct CR misalignment, and thereby improve mood and sleep. By this approach,
ultimately we aim to optimize P-M health and prevent disease and disability. Hypotheses are: 1) SLI which
phase-advance (shift earlier) vs phase-delay (shift later) CRs, best measured by melatonin, will ameliorate
mood and sleep dysfunction, and 2) A corrective phase-shift in the primary biological target, melatonin timing,
will be a significant mediator of improved function. In P-M depressed participants (DP) vs normal controls (NC),
we recently reported increased plasma melatonin secretion and delayed morning melatonin offset associated
with mood and sleep disturbances; correcting the phase-delayed melatonin CR with critically-timed sleep
(wake therapy) + light interventions improved mood and sleep within 1-2 weeks, correlating significantly with
melatonin phase-advance. To confirm target engagement and intervention mechanisms, in P-M women we will
compare 1) an Active Phase-Advance Intervention (PAI): phase-advanced restricted sleep (sleep 9pm-1am)
for 1 night, followed by 2 weeks of phase-advancing morning (AM) bright white light (BWL) for 30 min/day
starting within 30 min of wake time, vs 2) a Control Phase-Delay Intervention (PDI): phase-delayed restricted
sleep (sleep 3-7am) for 1 night, followed by 2 weeks of phase-delaying evening (PM) BWL for 30 min/day
ending 30 min before bedtime. In pilot data, we found relatively inert effects of Control PDI on melatonin and
nonsignificant (non-worsening) effects on mood and sleep. Combining SLI hastens, potentiates and maintains
their beneficial effects. In a randomized parallel design in 100 P-M women with mood and sleep/activity
dysfunction, we will administer either PAI or PDI at home (to enhance ecological validity), assessing effects on
psychometric measures, urinary 6-sulfatoxy-melatonin (6-SMT) and actigraphy sleep/activity. This innovative
combination of SLI identifies novel targets for health and disease prevention, and addresses an unmet
therapeutic need in P-M women. It extends to the P-M our investigations of CR dysregulation and its
restoration with SLI in other mood and sleep disorders associated with hormonal change in premenstrual and
peripartum depression. This approach potentially offers a safe, efficacious, rapid-acting, well-tolerated, non-
pharmacological, sustainable, affordable, home, and thus effective, intervention that can reduce health
disparities. This work also forms the basis for future trials, aiming to optimize treatment outcomes by identifying
chronobiological targets specific to an individual, the goal of personalized, preventative medicine."
10933012,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Pandemic preparedness requires strengthening surveillance for emerging viruses, but also a plan for public
health response when the next pathogen rapidly infects humans on a global scale. In order to ensure that the
disproportionate disability and death experienced among disadvantaged populations in the US does not repeat
in a future pandemic, public health agencies will need to validate resource allocation and surveillance tools
within a health disparities framework. The RADx-UP Consortium enables such as an evaluation, since this
NIH-funded Consortium of over 130 projects, with over 370,000 nationwide participants, focused on improving
test access, and eliciting COVID19 stress and vaccine perception among underserved persons. Using RADx-
UP data as the ground truth, we will test whether three area level vulnerability indices—the Social Vulnerability
Index, the Minority Health Social Vulnerability Index, and the Community Vulnerability Index—identify persons
experiencing food or housing insecurity, or gaps in healthcare access during the pandemic (Aim 1). We will
leverage methods from clinical trial literature to assess RADx-UP data generalizability. We will link to American
Community Survey, and generate county-standardized estimates of pandemic stress and vaccine concerns for
the more than 900 US counties with participants in the RADx-UP consortium. We will then assess the
association of these standardized estimates with the three area level vulnerability indices. A second aim of the
proposed work will be to assess the predictive performance of the promising tool of wastewater surveillance
among underserved populations. We will link RADx-UP data with the publicly available National Wastewater
Surveillance System data, and compare wastewater infection prevalence metrics with the test positivity rate
among RADx-UP performed tests, and county-level hospitalizations and deaths. We will evaluate changes in
predictive performance over time (e.g., before versus after vaccine availability), and with integration of area-
level vulnerability indices and other census demographic variables. With the ultimate aim of reducing health
disparities in the future pandemic, our team of epidemiologists, statisticians, nephrology and infectious disease
clinicians, and health policy experts will evaluate existing and emerging pandemic preparedness tools. In doing
so, we hope to promote a public health infrastructure responsive to groups most vulnerable to the health and
social turbulence inherent to a pandemic."

Scrub typhus is a life-threatening disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi (Ot), an LPS-negative bacterium
that replicates preferentially in endothelial cells (EC) and phagocytes. While one million people are infected
yearly, with about one third of world population at risk of infection, effective strategies for infection control are
lacking. Information on disease pathogenesis and immune dysregulation is very limited. To address these
challenges, we have developed four different mouse models of scrub typhus that recapitulate clinical outcomes
in humans. This grant support has led to the first reports that i) Mincle (a phagocyte C-type lectin receptor, CLR)
can sense Ot Karp strain and synergize with TNFα to drive M1/Th1-skewed responses; ii) sustained
lung/brain/kidney inflammation and progressive loss of Tie2 (a key receptor for EC function and survival) are
hallmarks of lethal Karp infection, correlating with activation of endogenous damage-associated molecular
patterns (DAMPs); and iii) the concordance of “type 1-skewed/type 2-repressed immune signatures” is evident
for severe scrub typhus in both inbred (C57BL/6) and outbred (CD-1) mouse models. In contrast, the Ot Gilliam-
induced non-pathogenic outcome seems to be linked to distinct CLR and innate immune signatures. The
objective of this study is to define pathogenic mechanisms of vascular dysfunction and shared markers or
therapeutic targets for severe scrub typhus. Our central hypothesis is that innate immune programs induced by
Ot Karp or Gilliam infection in target cells shape pathogenic or protective adaptive immunity, vascular function,
and clinical outcomes. This hypothesis will be tested in two cohesive Specific Aims. Aim 1 will delineate
mechanisms by which CLR-like, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) drive innate immune
programs and distinct clinical outcomes in inbred mice. We will use two Ot strains to examine 1) innate immune
signatures in inflamed lung/spleen/brain tissues, focusing on CLR- and TGFβ-regulated pathways; 2) infection-
triggered M1/M2 polarization and their impact on EC activation/survival/death; 3) functional diversity of dendritic
cell (DC) subsets during infection and T cell-priming. Aim 2 will examine whether/how differential alarmin
responses, especially those regulated by the IL-33 and CD24 pathways, determine acute tissue injury, vascular
dysfunction, and host mortality. 1) To define disease “shared” immune signatures and vascular markers beyond
Tie2, we will assess transcriptomics of lung/brain/kidney during severe disease stages and use perfused lungs
for 30-color spectrum flow cytometry. 2) To examine alarmin-associated regulation, we will use Karp/Gilliam-
infected inbred mice, soluble CD24Fc (a known repressor for DAMP, but not PAMP, pathways), and knockout
mice. 3) We will use peripheral blood samples from all four models for cell RNAseq and serum Olink proteomic
profiling. Validation of blood- and tissue-derived immune signatures has high clinical relevance and translational
potential. Findings from this renewal application will be highly significant not only for scrub typhus, but also for
other severe/systematic infections that target our endothelial system."

Aging is associated with functional decline of the hematopoietic system and clonal hematopoiesis (CH), a
poorly understood process by which long-lived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their progeny with certain
somatic mutations undergo positive selection. Individuals with CH have increased risk of developing blood
cancer, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality. Thus, CH is a healthspan-limiting
condition. Understanding how and why CH occurs with aging, and defining effective interventions to extend
healthspan, have strong potential to reduce the frequency or severity of CH-associated diseases in aged
individuals. Our laboratory has recently made formative discoveries that the aging bone marrow
microenvironment and impaired HSC mitochondrial function cooperate to cause HSC aging. These
discoveries have inspired us to define the components of aging that contribute to positive selection of CH-
mutant HSCs. The major goal of this proposal is to determine processes by which hematopoietic-intrinsic and
-extrinsic factors cause age-associated CH. Using a mouse model of a common CH mutation in DNMT3A, our
preliminary data demonstrate that both hematopoietic-intrinsic and -extrinsic adaptive mechanisms facilitate
selective advantage of Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs in the context of aging. We hypothesize that Dnmt3a-mutant
HSCs are adapted to survive and self-renew in an aging microenvironment through enhanced mitochondrial
metabolism, and that they promote premature senescence of the microenvironment to further their selective
advantage. In Aim 1, we will identify the specific mitochondrial alterations in Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs that
functionally increase their competitive advantage in an aging microenvironment. In Aim 2, we will determine
the mechanisms by which Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs induce senescence of mesenchymal stromal cells in the BM
microenvironment. In Aim 3, we will determine the extent to which targeting mesenchymal stromal cell
senescence will reduce the functional competitive advantage of Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs and progression to
hematologic pathology. Successful completion of this project will determine the mechanisms by which
hematopoietic-intrinsic and -extrinsic processes confer a competitive advantage to Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs
during aging. We expect that understanding these mechanisms will allow prioritization of targets for
therapeutic intervention to limit CH-associated pathologies including myeloid malignancies, cardiovascular
disease, and type 2 diabetes."

Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), which consist of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, affect as many as
1.4 million people in the USA. Intestinal barrier dysfunction is one of the hallmarks associated with IBD. Currently,
there are no treatments available to target gut barrier dysfunction in IBD pathogenesis. The aryl hydrocarbon
receptor (AHR) is a transcription factor expressed in several cell types and is activated by a variety of exogenous
and endogenous ligands, including microbial metabolites. Activation of AHR regulates many pathophysiological
functions, including inflammation and gut barrier integrity. Recently, we identified that the microbial metabolite
Urolithin A (UroA) is an AHR ligand that enhances gut barrier function. Treatment with UroA mitigated colitis in
pre-clinical models. This proposal originated from the novel observation that selective activation of AhR by UroA
in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) is critical for the regulation of gut barrier function. This process requires
activation of the NLRP6-IL-18 pathway in IEC to induce IL-22 from type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3).
Furthermore, we identified that UroA-induced genes are responsible for goblet cell differentiation, leading to
increased mucins and enhanced gut barrier function. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that UroA
selectively activates the AHR-NLRP6-dependent secretion of homeostatic levels of IL-18 in IEC, leading to highly
differentiated goblet cells that enhance gut barrier function, reduce unwarranted inflammation, and mitigate IBD.
We propose three specific aims to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will determine the role of each component of the
AHR-NLRP6-IL-18/IL-22 axis in UroA-mediated protective activities against IBD pathogenesis using pre-clinical
models of colitis. We will establish the novel cross-talk mechanisms of IEC selective activation of AHR-NLRP6
pathways that regulate IL-18, and IL-18 dependent IL-22 production from ILC3. In Aim 2, we will examine the
mechanisms of UroA-mediated goblet cell differentiation and production of different types of mucus that enhance
gut barrier function. Aim 3 will establish the translational relevance of selective activation of IEC AHR-IL-18
pathway by UroA in human IBD patient samples. Upon completion of this study, the mechanisms and beneficial
effects of selective activation of the AHR-NLRP6-IL-18 axis to enhance gut barrier function and the therapeutic
implications in IBD will be established."
10883504,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive and incurable disease involving pathological signaling
between pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. The goal of this project is to study the
NOTCH3 extracellular domain (NOTCH3 ECD) as a serum biomarker for this disease, with the objective of
applying these discoveries and enabling the translation of our findings into clinical practice. The NOTCH3
receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells is activated by Jagged-1 ligand binding, which induces cleavage of
the receptor into two peptide fragments: the NOTCH3 ECD and the intracellular domain (NOTCH3 ICD). The
NOTCH3 ICD translocates to the nucleus and stimulates a signaling cascade that results in PASMC proliferation,
anti-apoptosis, and marks cells destined to become pulmonary neointimal cells. The fate of the NOTCH3 ECD
in the lung is not known and will be the focus of this grant. In preliminary work, we have shown that human PAH
is characterized by the overexpression and increased cleavage of NOTCH3. We have found that the severity of
PAH in humans and pulmonary hypertension in rodents correlates with the amount of NOTCH3 ICD in the lung.
We have demonstrated that mice with homozygous deletion of Notch3 do not develop pulmonary hypertension
in response to hypoxia or SU5416/hypoxic stimulation and that pulmonary hypertension can be successfully
treated in mice and rats by administration of a monoclonal antibody that blocks Jagged-1 binding to Notch3 in
small pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. We hypothesize that after NOTCH3 cleavage, NOTCH3 ECD is
released into the serum and can serve as a useful non-invasive biomarker for PAH. To this end, we have
developed a novel bioassay to measure NOTCH3 ECD levels in the serum of humans and rodents. To test our
hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) test whether patients with PAH have elevated levels of
NOTCH3 ECD in their serum and whether this biomarker reliably predicts pulmonary vascular resistance, mean
pulmonary artery pressure, and tricuspid regurgitant velocity in individuals of different races and ethnicities,
sexes, and ages, both at diagnosis and in serial measurements during disease progression, 2) demonstrate that
the serum blood test for NOTCH3 ECD is specific to patients with WHO Group 1 (idiopathic) PAH and can
accurately predict disease progression, irrespective of patient drug regimens, and 3) elucidate the molecular
mechanisms and cellular interactions in the pulmonary arterial wall that lead to release of NOTCH3 ECD into the
serum in this disease. Information gained from the proposed experiments should put forth a unique, simple
blood test for the diagnosis of PAH and augment our understanding of NOTCH3 signaling in this disease."

dementia’s (ADRD) have risen 145% in the last two decades. Progress to find a solution to this public health
crisis has been slow. To help accelerate progress in the understanding, treatment, and prevention of ADRD, this
application is for establishment of an NIA Institutional National Research Service Award (T32) titled, “University
of Rochester Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease Training Program (UR-AADTP)”. Consistent with longstanding and
established strengths at the University of Rochester in foundational and translational research on aging and
ADRD, our goal is to accelerate the development and application of strategies to reduce the morbidity and
mortality associated with ADRD. We seek support for six predoctoral fellows (3 slots in year 1) in basic and
translational research programs who will undergo an innovative curriculum that emphasizes interdisciplinary
science and informs their training through interactions with people affected by dementia and their health care
providers. The UR-AADTP’s primary objective is to develop a cadre of early-stage scientists with the depth and
breadth of knowledge, skills, appreciation, and experience necessary to establish careers as independent
investigators in the area of dementia research; to work in an interdisciplinary environment designed to
aggressively translate research to practice; and to reduce the toll of cognitive disorders in later life. The UR-
AADTP T32 has these specific aims:
Aim 1: We will recruit a diverse group of highly qualified predoctoral trainees who are committed to careers in
aging research, retain them until their training is complete, and support their successful transitions to post-
graduate academic positions. The trainees’ diversity will be reflected in their racial/ethnic backgrounds as well
as the range of scientific disciplines and areas of research interest that they represent.
Aim 2: Through courses, seminars and workshops, and mentored research experiences, we will provide UR-
AADTP T32 trainees with a firm foundation in the theories and methods of basic and early translational aging
research that are necessary for study of dementia pathogenesis and treatment development.
Aim 3: By fostering interactions between trainees and faculty members trained in different theoretical and
methodological approaches to aging and dementia research, we will stimulate interdisciplinary collaborations in
aging research that accelerate the progress of dementia research, treatment and prevention.
Aim 4: Through structured exposure to clinical settings, people affected by dementia, and the providers that
care for them, trainees will appreciate the connections between research and practice necessary to accelerate
the development of effective approaches to illness prevention and mitigation.
Aim 5: We will rigorously evaluate the program and its participants (faculty and trainees)."

 This is a proposal for the first renewal of a focused training program in basic and translational
approaches to neurodegenerative disease for predoctoral students at the University of Alabama at Birmingham
(UAB). The rationale for a specialized program in this area is founded on several critical factors, including the
aging of the US population, which has led to dramatic growth in the numbers of patients affected by
neurodegenerative disease, and rapid expansion of funding for research on neurodegenerative diseases,
which is increasing the need for well-trained investigators. UAB has invested heavily in this area making it an
ideal environment for such a training program; during the current cycle UAB become one of only four
institutions in the country currently with NIH funding for both a Udall Center for Excellence in Parkinson’s
Disease and an Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. A primary goal of the Training Program in
Neurodegeneration is to achieve broad competence in neurodegeneration research; we seek to expose
students to the biological mechanisms and research approaches used across neurodegenerative disease,
rather than the single-disease training they might receive working in an individual research laboratory. This
program provides support for advanced pre-doctoral students in the research phase of their training. Most
students enter the Training Program in Neurodegeneration from the UAB Graduate Biomedical Science
Program, which admits about 70 students annually, or the UAB Medical Scientist Training Program, which
admits 10 students annually. Students work under the supervision of one of 29 highly qualified and well-funded
mentors. Five of these are junior mentors, and there are plans for mentor development and co-mentoring. The
program incorporates required didactic course work in neurodegeneration and experimental rigor, workshops
in quantitative analysis of big data, training in new tools and technologies, specialized journal clubs, experience
with an array of presentation styles ranging from datablitzes to lay talks, an annual retreat, and mentor and
outcomes evaluations. Diversity is emphasized and the program serves a high proportion of trainees from
underrepresented groups. Our core philosophy is to enable the cures of the future by providing a robust
training pathway in translational neurodegeneration research. This unique emphasis will enable our students to
take leading roles in therapeutic discovery across the spectrum of different skills sets and enterprises which
are required to deliver the vitally needed treatments of the future."
10884247,"Cutaneous melanoma is highly lethal and the fifth most common cancer in the U.S. Peak incidence is in middle
age adults but the elderly, young adults and even children are affected. Among all cancer types, melanoma is
one of the most aggressive in its propensity for extremely early metastasis. Metastatic melanoma is difficult to
eradicate and new therapies are urgently needed to limit disease progression. Genetic causes of melanoma
align along a continuum of RAS protein signaling whereby BRAFV600E mutation is the most common driver. The
mutant BRAFV600E protein depends on MAPK signaling for both initiation and maintenance of tumor growth.
Targeting this abnormally-activated pathway with RAF and MEK inhibitors have had limited success in treating
this disease due to MAPK signaling reactivation, causing drug resistance. Thus, more mechanistic insights are
needed in order to develop combination therapies that can circumvent resistance. We reported that aberrant
activation of the small GTPase ARF6, a protein that controls intracellular trafficking, accelerates metastasis of
BRAFV600E melanoma. Prior to metastasis, our unpublished data reveal that the protein ARF6 is also required for
efficient tumor development and growth in mice with BRAFV600E melanoma. This positions ARF6 as a key
regulator at multiple points in disease progression. Indeed, our preliminary data suggest a novel role for ARF6
in MAPK signaling by regulating the nuclear localization of activated, phospho-ERK, a key effector protein for
BRAF. Thus, we hypothesize that ARF6 modulates BRAFV600E-mediated tumor progression, controlling MAPK
signaling and providing a vulnerable node for pharmacologic inhibition of both tumor growth and metastasis.
Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, including our unique mouse models and a specific ARF6 inhibitor
that we helped develop, our goals are to dissect the roles of ARF6 in MAPK signaling, discover new role(s) for
ARF6 in tumor cell function, and test the efficacy of ARF6 inhibitors in restricting tumor progression. Pursuant to
these goals, we will: 1) Test the hypothesis that ARF6 controls MAPK signaling in BRAFV600E-melanoma; 2) Test
the hypothesis that ARF6 is critical for proliferation and survival of BRAFV600E melanoma; 3) Test the hypothesis
that pharmacologic inhibition of ARF6 has therapeutic efficacy in BRAFV600E melanoma patient-derived
xenografts (MPDX). Successful completion of the aims in this proposal will identify new mechanisms of
melanoma progression that are amenable to therapeutic intervention and may position ARF6 as a potential
therapeutic target in RAS-mutant cancers."

Satellite cells are muscle-specific stem cells that are responsible for skeletal muscle growth and regeneration.
The myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) MYOD and MYF5 are essential for muscle lineage determination in
the embryo and are induced in activated satellite cells as an early response to muscle injury. Recent gene-
targeting studies using a new MyoD conditional knockout allele (MyoDcKO) showed that either MyoD or Myf5 is
essential for muscle regeneration; satellite cells lacking both genes (dKO) accumulate in injured muscle but are
unable to undergo myogenic differentiation. In this proposal, new genetic tools and strategies are used to
determine the functions of MyoD and Myf5 in satellite cell development, lineage determination, differentiation
and self-renewal. In addition, transcriptional control mechanisms that regulate MyoD expression in satellite
cells and during embryogenesis are interrogated. In Aim 1, cell type identification by immunofluorescence and
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) will establish whether dKO satellite cells adopt non-myogenic cell
fates, the extent to which they retain myogenic programming, and their capacity for self-renewal. Experiments
will also distinguish cell-autonomous and non-autonomous effects of MRF deficiency. Aim 2 will utilize RNA-
seq to define the transcriptome of mutant satellite cells in uninjured and injured skeletal muscle, which will
identify direct and indirect transcriptional targets of MYOD and MYF5 as well as regulatory pathways and
cellular processes impacted by the loss of these MRFs. In addition, Pro-seq (genome-wide Precision Run-On)
analyses will quantify changes in active gene transcription, will identify candidate genes regulated by promoter-
proximal polymerase pausing, and will identify potential enhancer targets of MYOD and MYF5. Aim 3 will
determine whether the function of MyoD or Myf5 is required for satellite cell development by producing dKO
satellite cell precursors at embryonic, fetal and neonatal stages and testing their capacity to generate adult
satellite cells, as assessed by molecular and anatomical criteria. Recent data demonstrate that the only
enhancer elements known to regulate MyoD expression (the core enhancer and distal regulatory region) are
not necessary for MyoD transcription during embryogenesis or in satellite cells. Aim 4 will utilize transfection,
transgenic and CRISPR-based knockout methodologies to define the regulatory functions of novel putative
enhancer elements identified by PRO-seq and bioinformatic analyses. The proposed research will contribute
significantly to an understanding of fundamental gene regulatory mechanisms that control satellite cell stem
cell functions and may lead to the development of new cell types and strategies for cell-based therapies for
muscle degenerative diseases."

10883513,"Abstract
We often depict signaling pathways by a dozen or so landmark phosphorylation events that culminate in the
transcription of a gene or induction of a phenotype. In reality, a cascade of hundreds to thousands of
phosphorylation sites create dynamic biochemical networks that orchestrate essentially every cellular process
from expression of transcriptional programs and cell proliferation to migration and cytotoxic effector functions. T
cell signaling is an important example. Signal transduction through the T cell receptor and co-stimulatory
molecules is incredibly complex and leads to important but distinct downstream effects necessary for proper
immune responses to pathogens, cancer, and vaccines. As humans age, T cell signaling becomes detrimentally
altered, leading to “immunosenescence” and less efficient protection from malignancies. Mass spectrometry has
enabled the profiling of tens of thousands of phosphorylation sites from a diverse range of cells and tissues.
Unfortunately, functionally characterizing the tens of thousands of post-translational modifications cells use to
coordinate essentially all cellular and organismal processes remains a fundamental challenge in biology. Here,
we propose an innovative technology that will enable the functional assessment of thousands of phosphorylation
sites in high throughput. We will employ CRISPR-mediated base editors, which mutate codons in genomic DNA,
coupled to phenotypic screens to probe the signaling events that lead to specific T cell stimulation-specific gene
expression programs or proliferation responses. Preliminary data from our laboratory strongly suggests that we
can functionally screen tens of thousands of phosphorylation sites for their contribution to NFAT or
NFKB signaling in stimulated T cells. In this proposal, we will further optimize this technology to create a
robust, reliable screening platform. To validate our screening technology, we will characterize a subset of
phosphorylation site mutants using conventional genomic engineering methods to understand how our screening
platform compares to classic approaches to study phosphorylation site function, i.e. one mutation at a time. We
will also extend this approach to primary human CD8+ T cells, to show that we can uncouple the signaling events
that lead to cell proliferation or expression of the activation/exhaustion marker PD1. High throughput functional
screening of phosphorylation sites in primary immune cells will revolutionize the way we study signaling
pathways and cellular decision making, and the way we approach drug development or adoptive cell therapies
to treat cancer and a variety of human ailments associated with aging."

Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) is a devastating skin blistering disease for which there
currently is no cure. RDEB is caused by mutations in the gene encoding type VII collagen (C7), leading to
epidermal fragility, trauma-induced blistering, and long term, hard-to-heal wounds. Fibrosis develops rapidly in
RDEB skin and contributes to both chronic wounds, which emerge after cycles of repetitive wounding and scar
formation, and squamous cell carcinoma, the single biggest cause of death in this patient group. The molecular
pathways disrupted in a broad spectrum of fibrotic disease are also disrupted in RDEB and as such RDEB is a
paradigm for understanding the molecular basis of fibrosis. We have shown that RDEB pathogenesis is driven
by a radical change in extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and increased TGFβ signaling that is a direct result
of C7 loss-of-function in dermal fibroblasts. However, the mechanism of how C7 loss results in extensive fibrosis
has until recently remained unclear. Our now published work has identified a direct role for C7 in protein secretion
which when defective or absent leads to accumulation of intracellular proteins, and subsequent increases in
cellular stress and the initiation of a pro-fibrotic cascade of TGFβ signaling. This paradigm shifting work has shed
significant light onto the conundrum in the field presented by RDEB – why does RDEB develop life threatening
skin cancers while other forms of Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), characterized by continued tissue damage and
non-healing wounds, do not? In parallel, and using patient cells, we have identified anti-viral drugs, which inhibit
the production and release of viral particles (a process known to hijack cellular transport pathways), are
normalizing RDEB secretion defects and therefore represent a novel therapeutic approach to treat RDEB by
preventing fibrosis. Furthermore, our work comparing RDEB with non-RDEB patient cells has identified
increased TGFβ signaling as a potential mechanism of disrupted protein secretion in non-RDEB cells, which is
independent of the protein defect in RDEB, and anti-viral drugs may represent a novel anti-fibrotic that could
have application to a wider range of diseases, beyond RDEB. Therefore, our proposal seeks to investigate
protein secretion defects we have identified in RDEB fibroblasts and determine the mechanism of action of anti-
viral drugs in reducing fibrosis. At the same time, we will assess the anti-fibrotic action of anti-viral drugs in a
preclinical mouse model of RDEB and if successful future steps (not part of this funding application) will be to
initiate a clinical trial of successful candidate drugs. Together, our integrated in vitro and in vivo studies will define
and characterize a novel mechanism of progressive fibrosis, and assess preclinical efficacy of new molecular
entities that can be translated into the clinic for improved patient treatment."

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a leading cause of neurological disability, causing
devastating impairments in cognition and functional capacity . Although there has been considerable progress
in identifying mechanisms underlying ADRD, and symptomatic treatment is available for some ADRD, there is
urgent need for greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying these dementias to identify potential
treatment targets and to contribute to successful treatment trials. Because of its ability to resolve brain
structure and function noninvasively, neuroimaging has become a leading strategy used for translational
research in ADRD and a prominent biomarker strategy for clinical differential diagnosis of ADRD, for defining
preclinical stages of ADRD, and for evaluating for target engagement and therapeutic responses in trials.
Modern neuroimaging is an inherently interdisciplinary field combining expertise in physics, chemistry,
engineering, computer science, neuroscience, and statistics to localize and quantify a large array of metrics
reflecting the molecular, cellular, structural, functional, and physiological properties of the central nervous
system. Additional expertise in topics such as genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, neuropharmacology,
psychology, and neuromodulation are also required to optimally combine or apply neuroimaging with other key
areas in ADRD research. Finally, because of its multidimensional nature, neuroimaging is a “big data” field
requiring expertise in informatics and data management. The University of Pennsylvania has a longstanding
track record of innovation and translation in biomedical neuroimaging in ADRD, and supports state-of-the-art
instrumentation for in vivo MRI, PET, CT, and optical imaging in both humans and preclinical models as well as
extensive expertise and resources in image processing and spatiotemporal statistics.
In response to PAR-21-112 the proposed “Cross-disciplinary training program in translational neuroimaging of
ADRD” will draw predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees from both biological and quantitative science
backgrounds who are seeking a research career focusing on neuroimaging in ADRD. A core curriculum
covering neuroimaging methods will be combined with specializations in 1) imaging studies of disease
mechanism, 2) imaging biomarkers and neuroimaging trials, or 3) statistical and computational approaches to
neuroimaging data. A diverse faculty with outstanding track records of research and mentoring in neuroimaging
and related fields will participate, with each trainee receiving dual mentorship from faculty with complementary
expertise. The aims of the proposed training program are 1) to train the next generation of ADRD
neuroimaging researchers, 2) to increase diversity in neuroimaging research through efforts to increase
diversity in both program trainees and program faculty, 3) to expand local ADRD neuroimaging research
through participation of training faculty with related domain expertise, and 4) to provide training in the
Responsible Conduct of Research and Experimental Rigor, particularly as it applies to neuroimaging."
10882722,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goal of this project is to understand the role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in the
regulation of the function and homeostasis of the skin epidermal permeability barrier. In this project we will
expand on our discovery that the AHR regulates keratinocyte differentiation by controlling metabolic
reprogramming and test the hypothesis that differences in the ligand-directed metabolomes moderate the
balance between toxic and therapeutic AHR ligands. Past project periods of this application have focused on
understanding the mechanisms of action that result in the skin toxicity of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
(TCDD) and other environmental pollutants that work through the AHR. In 2022, tapinarof (TAP) was approved
as the first therapeutic AHR ligand for treatment of psoriasis. This application proposes to leverage the
differences in the actions of these AHR ligands to explore their distinct programs of metabolic reprogramming,
contributing to their respective metabolomes and their actions on the skin. In preliminary studies we identified
lipid biosynthesis and metabolism as major components of AHR-regulated metabolic reprogramming. Using
lipidomic analyses, we found differences in key bioactive lipids of the lipidomes of TCDD and TAP that differ in
pro- and anti-inflammatory activities. To test our hypothesis that differences in the ligand-directed
metabolomes moderate the balance between disease-promoting (“Toxic”) and health-promoting
(“Therapeutic”) AHR ligands, we propose three aims. 1) Define the ligand-directed metabolomes of TCDD and
TAP, cataloging common and divergent lipidomes and their bioactive lipids; 2) Determine the modulatory
effects of TCDD and TAP on human keratinocyte models of psoriasis; 3) Identify the key bioactive lipid
pathways of TCDD and TAP in mouse epidermis and determine their roles in ligand modulation of imiquimod-
induced psoriasiform lesions. Findings from these studies will advance the fundamental understanding of the
molecular responses to ligand activation of the keratinocyte AHR and the physiological processes of the
epidermis that are affected in a ligand-selective manner."

BRCA1 and BRCA2 facilitate DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair via homologous recombination (HR). Yet
BRCA1/2 are often mutated in cancers, such as breast/ovarian/prostate/pancreatic carcinomas. BRCA-deficient
cancer cells are therefore HR-defective, and susceptible to agents that induce DNA damage and/or prevent DSB
repair. For instance, Poly-ADP ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitors (PARPi) preferentially kill BRCA-deficient
cancer cells and are approved to treat HR-deficient cancers. However, only ~60% patients respond to PARPi
and drug resistance is a major problem. Thus, developing second-generation precision medicines that target
HR-deficient cancers and/or overcome PARPi resistance is urgently needed.
 DNA polymerase theta (Polq), a DNA repair factor important for microhomology-mediated end-joining
(MMEJ) of DSBs, has been recently validated as a druggable target in BRCA-deficient cancers. Polq is essential
for BRCA-deficient cancer cells, but is dispensable for BRCA-proficient cells, and Polq null mice exhibit no major
phenotypes. Recently reported Polq inhibitors (Polqi) showed preferential killing of BRCA-deficient cells. Yet,
these early stage inhibitors have significant deficiencies (i.e. poor ADME and PK parameters, or low potency)
which may limit their efficacy in clinical studies. We have developed a novel, oral bioavailable Polqi that exhibits
5.1 nM IC50 against Polq polymerase (Polq-pol), selectively kills BRCA-deficient cells, and exhibits better
pharmacokinetics than recently published Polqi. Our collaborative team (Pomerantz, Johnson, and Childers labs)
plans to further improve and demonstrate proof-of-principle of our novel Polqi as the potentially best-in-class
Polqi by developing the following Aims: 1. Optimization of Polqi via a prodrug strategy; 2. Biochemical and
cellular characterization of Polqi; 3. In vivo efficacy of optimized Polqi in BRCA-deficient solid tumors.
We expect that successful completion of these Aims will enable the development of a potentially best-in-class
Polqi prodrug candidate."

These investigations explore the hypothesis that maternal inflammation due to acute or chronic virus infection
during pregnancy has a durable impact on the development of the fetal immune system, which is mediated by
changes in placental function and transplacental transfer of metabolites and inflammatory mediators to the
fetus. Our studies have shown that subclinical rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) infection during pregnancy is
associated with dramatic alterations of immune function in offspring—demonstrating a vertical effect of
maternal inflammation on immune system development. Our prior studies have also demonstrated a fetal
response that impacts how microglial cells, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, engage
and engulf neural precursor cells. These investigations will probe the link between maternal, placental, and
fetal inflammation in a translational primate model system that closely recapitulates human development and
disease, and using state-of-the-art tools and technologies through the following Specific Aims: (1) Determine
the impact of acute maternal RhCMV infection and consequent inflammation on fetal innate and adaptive
immune functions, in seronegative and seropositive dams; (2) Assess the impact of acute and chronic RhCMV
infection on the placenta and maternal-fetal cell trafficking; and (3) Test the postnatal consequences of fetal
immune development in the context of maternal infection with RhCMV and associated inflammation. The
studies proposed are designed to test the hypothesis that maternal, placental, and fetal immune responses
contribute to developmental sequelae including alterations in postnatal immunity, providing key insights on a
common worldwide maternal and congenital infection."
10882112,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Open fractures are frequently (more than 150,000 cases in the U.S. every
year) seen and have high (~10%) infection rates. Open fracture-associated infections are clinically devastating,
and have led to reduced limb function, secondary operations, delayed union/nonunion, and death. Infection has
led to significantly high costs in healthcare, resulting in approximately $500 million of additional costs in managing
open fractures each year in the U.S. Further complicating the problem, alarmingly high percentages (e.g., 32.2%
for tibial fractures) of open fracture infections are associated with antibiotic resistant bacteria, which have led to
a two-fold increase in morbidity and mortality, and have made the drug choices for infection management
increasingly limited. The long-term goal of this application is to develop translational strategies to prevent or
treat bone infections in clinical settings. The objective of this project is to develop safe antimicrobial nanohybrid
methods to reduce antibiotic resistant infections in open fractures. The central hypothesis is that nanohybriding
two unique antimicrobial materials with different dimensions at the nanometer scale will synergistically enhance
antimicrobial properties and significantly reduce host toxicity. There are three specific aims: (i) To test the
hypothesis that innovative silver nanoparticle-carbon nanotube (AgNP-CNT) nanohybrids present high
antimicrobial properties against various bacteria seen in open fractures and low toxicity toward cells important
to bone. (ii) To test the hypothesis that AgNP-CNT nanohybrids present high antimicrobial properties and low
host toxicity in preventing antibiotic resistant infections in an animal model. (iii) To test the hypothesis that
bioengineering AgNP-CNT nanohybrids on implant surfaces enhances preclinical outcomes. Specifically, the in
vitro antimicrobial properties of AgNP-CNT nanohybrids will be tested against a variety of bacteria and their
cytotoxicity properties toward multiple human cells will be determined. The nanohybrids will be tested in an open
femur fracture rat model to assess their effects on infection, healing, and host toxicity. Moreover, the nanohybrids
will be bioengineered on orthopaedic implants and their coatings will be tested both in vitro and in vivo; delivering
antimicrobials at the implant surface is expected to achieve high antimicrobial levels at the right place to minimize
systemic toxicity. This project will contribute new knowledge on how hybriding two materials with different
dimensions at the nanometer scale may synergistically increase antimicrobial properties and reduce host toxicity.
The expected outcome is a biologically safe, nanotechnology-based strategy that will drive and broaden the
safe use of silver and carbon nanotubes for local biomedical applications (e.g., open fracture fixation). The
nanohybrids may be engineered on various medical products – ranging from bone grafts, dental implants, and
catheters, to bandages and needles – to reduce infections while improving recovery."
10881407,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Stroke is the leading cause of disability, the second leading cause of dementia, and the second leading
cause of death worldwide, affecting nearly 800,000 patients per annum in the U.S. alone. Cerebrovascular
ischemia is rapidly potentiated by rising body temperatures, occurring even with mild and sub-febrile
hyperthermia. The potency of hyperthermic damage in ischemic brain arises due to impaired cooling in
hypoperfused brain tissues. Consequently, localized brain hyperthermia can precede, and commonly exceeds,
systemic temperature changes following ischemic injury, and is well-recognized as accelerating stroke
progression and consumption of at-risk tissues. Despite severe worsening of clinical outcomes among febrile
stroke patients, the development of prognostic biomarkers and robust treatment targets in peri-ischemic cerebral
hyperthermia remains unrealized due to lack of pragmatic means to acquire accurate spatially-resolved cerebral
thermographs.
 MR thermometry (MRT) using the proton resonance frequency (PRF) chemical shift with 1H-MR
spectroscopy (MRS) has been explored for non-invasive cerebral thermography. Despite promising results,
several fundamental limitations undermine estimation of absolute temperature and thus impede development of
meaningful clinical paradigms, including: 1) the local environment in tissues can significantly alter performance
and affect temperature estimation; 2) magnetic field fluctuations caused by physiological- and hardware-related
noise introduce large errors in temperature estimation; and 3) low temperature sensitivity and signal-to-noise of
spectroscopic imaging approaches hinder in vivo accuracy. This application addresses such challenges to fulfill
the elusive aim of absolute MR thermometry using novel multinuclear thermometry developed by the
investigators. Initial results suggest significantly heightened immunity to B0 drift, susceptibility, and pH, and
higher SNR per-unit time, relative to MRS approaches. These developments support an unprecedented level of
overall accuracy, and in this application we apply this approach towards development of absolute 3D whole-
brain thermometry for detection and characterization of ischemic cerebral hyperthermia."

Tissue engineering through 3D printing is a promising approach to address the donor organ shortage that
severely limits the impact of transplantation therapy. Two current challenges in tissue engineering are how to
create a complex microvascular system with vessel segments of different caliber to provide effective graft
perfusion and how to prevent tissue engineered grafts made from allogeneic cell sources from triggering
immune-mediated rejection by the graft recipient. These problems are linked in that human endothelial cells
(ECs), required for perfusion, are immunogenic and can trigger rejection. We propose to address these
problems using synthetic skin as a model system. We have successfully developed bioinks containing human
fibroblasts (FBs), endothelial cells (ECs) and pericytes (PCs) from a single donor source and all cultured under
xeno-free conditions, within a matrix formed from human matrix proteins to create a papillary dermis with an
epidermis formed from keratinocytes (KCs), also from the same donor source and also cultured under xeno-
free conditions. In aim 1 we will optimize an additional bioink to create a collagen-dense reticular dermis as a
deep layer, adding vascular smooth muscle cells to drive formation of larger caliber vessels, thereby forming a
trilayered skin substitute. We will explore the use of delivering extracellular growth factors or intracellular gene
modifiers to enhance microvessel formation after engraftment on immunodeficient mouse hosts and we will
challenge engraftment by pharmacologically impairing wound healing. In aim 2, we will evaluate the
immunogenicity of these bioengineered skin constructs by engraftment on to human immune system mice,
using an established model as well as a new model with a more replete human immune system that has
myeloid and natural killer cells in addition to alloreactive human effector memory T cells. Finally, we will apply
state-of-the art genetic engineering or drug delivery approaches to reduce the immunogenicity of the
constituent graft cells, e.g., by ablation of HLA antigen expression, assessing whether this needs to be
performed on multiple cell populations. Our focus on skin as a target for generating a well perfused but non-
immunogenic engineered tissue also addresses an unmet clinical need and our use of wholly human
constituents to do so brings this closer to clinical translation. This project takes advantage of the synergistic
expertise of the two multiple principal investigators who have worked together for over a decade. Successful
completion of our aims will establish a prototype for developing a clinical therapeutic and will establish
principles with broad implications for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine."
10882687,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm diagnosed in about 5,000 Americans
each year, characterized by the presence of the t(9;22) Philadelphia chromosome and its protein product, the
BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase, in the leukemic cells. Current therapy for CML is centered on tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib mesylate, which can induce cytogenetic and molecular remissions in most
patients, who then enjoy normal age-adjusted life expectancy. This clinical success will lead to an estimated
prevalence of ~200,000 CML patients in the U.S. by the year 2050, with attendant drug costs of >$10 billion that
can include burdensome out-of-pocket payments for patients. In addition, TKIs can have substantial side effects,
some of which are potentially life-threatening. Accordingly, recent efforts have been made to stop TKI therapy in
CML patients who have achieved molecular remission. About half of such patients experience progressive
molecular relapse following TKI stopping, but the other half either remain molecularly undetectable or experience
low-level recurrence that does not progress (collectively termed treatment-free remission or TFR), suggesting
that there are biological mechanisms that limit the ability of small numbers of leukemic stem cells to expand and
cause disease. These mechanisms are not understood, and represent a major unmet need in current CML
research, as we do not have validated approaches to increase the proportion of CML patients who are eligible
to stop their TKI nor to increase the proportion of patients who can maintain TFR.
 This application seeks to address these unmet needs by exploiting a newly developed CML mouse model
of TFR. In this model, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from an existing conditional double transgenic (dTg)
mouse model of CML are transplanted into recipient congenic B6 mice without the use of conditioning radiation.
The resulting bone marrow (BM) chimeras contain clones of dTg HSC in a background of normal BM,
representing a physiological model of early CML. Mice bearing large (>10%) clones of dTg HSC uniformly
develop CML-like leukemia when BCR-ABL1 expression is induced, but mice with smaller (<2%) dTg clones do
not develop CML, but instead exhibit fluctuating low levels of dTg granulocytes in peripheral blood that mimics
TFR. The proposed project will test whether two distinct processes, oncogene-induced replicative stress and the
BM microenvironment/niche, are involved in the ability of the host to control the malignancy. Aim 1 will test
whether oncogene-induced replicative stress is involved by a incorporating loss-of-function mutation in the p19Arf
gene in the dTg donor cells. Aim 2 will test whether elements of the BM niche, including immune cells and
cytokines, are required for disease control. Aim 3 will translate these findings to human CML BM samples using
the spatial mass cytometry to define the topography of the CML niche and correlate this with TFR outcomes.
These results will yield important new knowledge about the pathophysiology of TFR that should motivate novel
therapeutic approaches to increase the frequency and durability of TFR in CML patients."

 The intestinal immune system plays crucial roles in maintaining tissue and microbiome homeostasis
and in protecting from pathogens. Two major classes of intestinal immune cells are the intraepithelial
lymphocytes (IEL) and IgA producing cells. The factors controlling the compartmentalization and homeostasis
of immune cells in different intestinal niches are incompletely understood.
 G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) have diverse actions in recruiting and retaining cells in tissues.
Chemoattractant receptors couple to Gαi and have critical roles in cell recruitment to the gut. Recent studies
have identified important roles for Gα13-coupled receptors in organizing lymphoid niches, but their function in
the intestinal immune system is poorly understood. In preliminary data we find that removal of Gα13 from
hematopoietic cells leads to a deficiency of γδT and αβT IEL. In Aim 1, we will define how Gα13-signaling
contributes to IEL compartmentalization and function. Lineage specific Cre lines will enable dissection of
subset selective effects and tamoxifen-inducible TCRδ-CreERT2 will be used to define the stage(s) when
Gα13 is required in the γδT IEL compartment. CD8αβ T cells will be differentiated in vitro in the presence of
retinoic acid and TGFβ to induce a gut tropic α4β7+ CCR9+ state and used in transfer experiments to dissect
the mechanism by which Gα13-deficiency impacts on CD8αβ TCRαβ IELs. The role of downstream factors
Ahrgef1, RhoA and ROCK will be investigated as well as possible cross talk with AHR. The impact of Gα13-
deficiency on the response to intestinal pathogens will be studied.
 In Aim 2, the GPCRs acting upstream of Gα13 in IEL will be characterized. Our prior work showed that
GPR18 is important for IEL competitiveness. We will test the dependence of GPR18 function on Gα13
signaling. GPR55, a lysophosphatidylinositol responsive Gα13-coupled receptor, restrains IEL interaction with
the epithelium. We will test the possibility that in the absence of Gα13, GPR55 becomes dominantly coupled to
Gαi, leading to IEL mispositioning and loss. CRISPR-based knockout in retroviral bone marrow chimeras will
be used to identify further Gα13-coupled receptors contributing to IEL homeostasis.
 During our study of conditional Gα13-deficient mice we observed an exaggerated IgA response in
mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) but not Peyer’s patches. Individual MLNs drain different regions of the
intestine. In Aim 3, we will examine the impact of Gα13 deficiency in each MLN type. We will identify the
stage(s) during IgA+ GC B cell generation that Gα13 acts and perform microscopy and cell contact-tracing
studies to characterize the cell-cell interactions determining the magnitude of the MLN IgA response.
 These studies will advance our understanding of cues and signaling pathways acting to promote
intestinal lymphocyte homeostasis and function. Given that GPCRs are the most drugged class of molecules,
our studies are likely to lead to new opportunities to identify therapies for gut inflammatory diseases."

 Protein kinases are key regulators of cellular function and important therapeutic targets. Fluorescent
protein-based biosensors have revolutionized the way we study these signaling enzymes and enabled direct
interrogation of protein kinases in their native biological contexts. The goal of this proposal is to take this
technology to the next frontier by creating a series of ultrasensitive, high-performance biosensors and
developing multiplexed imaging approaches to be used in elucidating coordinated spatiotemporal signaling in
cancer-immune interactions. We have assembled a strong interdisciplinary team with complementary
expertise, including Dr. Jin Zhang, an expert in biosensor technologies and signal transduction, and Dr.
Yingxiao Peter Wang, a renowned bioengineer whose lab focuses on engineering fluorescent biosensors,
optogenetic tools, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T technologies. In our preliminary studies, we
developed single-FP kinase activity reporters that enable sensitive and multiplexed imaging of signaling
activities in living cells. One of the newly evolved kinase biosensor achieved very high sensitivity and allowed
high-resolution imaging in live mice. We have also developed an innovative technology platform that
integrates directed evolution with high-throughput screening and next-generation sequencing to develop high-
performance fluorescent biosensors directly in mammalian cells. In this project, we propose to integrate these
technology platforms to engineer novel single-fluorophore biosensors for multiplexed imaging of PKA, CaMKII,
Lck, and ZAP70 activities in living cells and perform parallel live-cell imaging to probe their dynamic activities
during the CAR T and target tumor cell engagement.
 Cell-based immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, but still faces significant challenges.
Understanding the mechanisms of cancer-immune interactions is critical for the development of enhanced
therapeutic strategies. Protein kinases Lck, ZAP70, PKA, and CaMKII play essential roles in T cell activation,
immunological synapse formation and cancer-immune evasion. We expect that parallel examination of these
key node regulators simultaneously in cancer-immune interacting environments should reveal novel insights
into the systems behaviors and identify essential links for therapeutic manipulation. While PKA, CaMKII, Lck,
and Zap70 have been chosen as first-pass targets to develop and implement our systematic biosensor
optimization approach, in principle, our platform can be readily extended to generate other kinase biosensors
and develop biosensors capable of monitoring other posttranslational modification events in live cells. We
believe that the success of this project will revolutionize biosensor engineering and kinase imaging to have a
transformative impact on the treatment of cancer and other diseases."

Female lower urinary tract disorders, such as urinary incontinence and urinary tract infections, are common
(affecting millions of women each year), costly, and sub-optimally managed. Additionally, insufficient research is
performed in this area, preventing the development of new and personalized therapies and strategies to optimize
care and well-being. This is, in part, because few physicians and scientists are trained to rigorously study these
disorders. This T32 will help meet this need by training MD clinical fellows and PhD post-doctoral fellows to
become leaders in the field of clinical outcomes research in female lower urinary tract disorders. Specifically, the
aims of this Washington University School of Medicine T32 Program are to: 1) establish a rigorous recruitment
and selection process to identify the most promising and diverse research-focused MD and PhD fellows; 2)
provide a structured, yet flexible, environment in which trainees receive individualized mentoring and
comprehensive training in female lower urinary tract disorders, research methods, the ethical conduct of
research, and grant-writing; 3) provide financial support and (protected) time to allow trainees to obtain a Master’s
degree in Clinical Investigation or Population Health Sciences, or relevant coursework in clinical outcomes
research; 4) continue and augment a robust existing conference and didactic series in which trainees discuss
current, clinical topics in female urinary tract disorders and research methods relevant to these disorders; 5)
implement a robust professional and career development program tailored to enhance trainees’ transition to
junior faculty status; 6) create a supportive, responsive, and flexible administrative structure to attract and nurture
the most exceptional trainees, particularly women and under-represented minorities; and 7) continually evaluate
and improve the Program in response to trainees’ needs. This Program will accept clinical (MD, MD/PhD) and
post-doctoral PhD fellows for up to three years of research training by a mentoring team composed of at least
one clinical and one methodologic (clinical outcomes) researcher. At least one of the mentors (the primary) will
be a senior researcher or clinician who is established in his/her field, funded, and has an excellent mentorship
track record. The Program structure is designed to foster a trans-disciplinary and collaborative culture, with the
goal that these cooperative relationships will carry into the future. To that end, MD and PhD trainees will be
united at weekly clinical and research conferences and in career and professional development activities.
Fellows will also have the option of matriculating in a Master’s degree program to learn clinical outcomes
research methods, or enhancing their existing skill set with specific graduate level courses. This program will
prepare the next generation of MD and PhD researchers in female lower urinary tract disorders to perform high-
quality clinical outcomes research, bringing much-needed methodologic rigor and a collaborative, trans-
disciplinary approach to the most pressing questions in this field."
10883025,"Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a highly morbid and potentially fatal complication of myositis.
Current myositis phenotypes do not capture significant heterogeneity in ILD clinical behavior.
Existing prediction models and biomarkers perform poorly in patients with myositis-ILD and
require longitudinal validation in diverse patient populations. Because clinicians lack tools to
prognosticate long-term myositis-ILD outcomes, many patients receive either inadequate or
overly aggressive treatment. We have shown that the GAP-ILD Index performs poorly in myositis-
ILD. Myositis-ILD specific prediction tools do not adequately model disease progression and do
not generalize to populations outside of Asia. Previously, we demonstrated that specific human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles are myositis-ILD susceptibility factors. Our preliminary model of
progression-free survival containing clinical data and HLA genotypes discriminated progression,
suggesting that HLA haplotypes are also biomarkers of myositis-ILD disease activity and
treatment responsiveness. As a next step, we plan to refine and validate our preliminary model.
The goal of Specific Aim 1 is to utilize a large, diverse multicenter cohort of patients with myositis-
ILD in North America to develop a prediction model of progression free survival using known and
novel biomarkers. While increasingly recognized, there is no current strategy to confront the
clinical and biological heterogeneity within myositis-ILD subgroups. Our preliminary data
demonstrates two clusters of myositis-ILD. We hypothesize that these myositis-ILD clusters carry
distinct pathobiology, treatment responsiveness, and outcomes. The goal of specific Aim 2 is to
apply cluster analysis to clinical, genomic, and serological data from patients with myositis-ILD to
identify novel subphenotypes. The data generated from this proposal will result in a novel
classification of myositis-ILD subphenotypes and a superior tool for prognosticating important
clinical outcomes. Our approach is feasible because we are building on existing clinical and
biorepository data from five demographically diverse myositis-ILD referral centers in the United
States. This contribution is significant because it will establish a validated clinical signature for
precision therapy in patients with myositis-ILD and generate novel treatment approaches."
10883354,"ABSTRACT
Gastric cancer is one of the most common and deadly cancers globally, accounting for over one million new
cancer diagnoses and 783,000 deaths in 2018. Infection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the most important
risk factor and a necessary cause for non-cardia gastric cancer. While targeting high-risk populations who are
infected with H. pylori seems a compelling strategy for gastric cancer screening and prevention, a significant
concern not addressed is that only ~1 to 3% of the H. pylori infected individuals develop gastric cancer, indicating
that a strategy based on H. pylori status alone is insufficient, particularly among populations with a relatively low
prevalence of H. pylori infection. Thus, discovering and validating additional biomarkers, especially non-invasive
ones, is necessary to facilitate the development of novel risk assessment tools for gastric cancer. The human
metabolome reflects endogenous responses to exposures, including environmental and lifestyle factors that are
related to carcinogenesis. The use of advanced metabolomics techniques in prospective population -based
cohort studies has successfully identified both novel etiologic factors and risk biomarkers for different cancers.
However, few prior studies have focused on identifying novel risk biomarkers for gastric cancer using
metabolomics techniques, particularly in prospective design settings. We recently conducted the first nested
case-control study within two large prospective cohorts. Our study identified 5 metabolites associated with risk
of gastric cancer after correction for multiple comparisons, and 13 additional metabolite candidates for further
investigations. These include metabolites related to vitamin B12 deficiency, green tea/coffee intake, and two
progestin steroids, representing a few biologically plausible mechanisms involved in gastric cancer etiology.
Herein, we propose to conduct a large prospective investigation within a newly formed international consortium
to validate these highly promising findings, as well as discovering novel risk biomarkers, using both untargeted
and targeted metabolomics approaches. Pre-diagnostic plasma samples and epidemiologic data including
demographics, lifestyle factors, and dietary intakes will be harmonized for ~1,200 incident cases and 1,600
matched controls from six prospective cohorts. The proposed study will incorporate a rigorous two-stage design
to screen and validate circulating metabolite biomarkers for gastric cancer risk in East Asians and European
Whites (Aim 1 & 2). Furthermore, we will assess mediating effects of the identified metabolites on the

10876435,"Orofacial tissues are richly innervated by nociceptive primary afferents (or nociceptors). Nociceptors transmit
pain signals into brain in response to harmful stimuli. Nociceptors also intricately regulate homeostasis of
innervated tissues by controlling host responses. Under injury or infection, dysfunctional nociceptors lead to
the development of pathological chronic pain and abnormal destructive responses of affected tissues. Dr.
Chung’s unique R35 program addresses dual roles of trigeminal nociceptors in two fundamental areas in oral
health. Dr. Chung is a dentist scientist, who has devoted his career to craniofacial neuroscience research
focused on trigeminal nociceptors. He will continue his ongoing craniofacial pain studies by testing the
hypothesis that long-term silencing of nociceptive afferents is analgesic, and that the effects are sufficient to
reverse maladaptive neuroplastic changes of brain regions associated with chronic pain. Moreover, Dr. Chung
is revisiting his long-term interest in tooth-related neurobiology, and will investigate the neuroimmune and
neuroskeletal regulatory mechanisms of alveolar bone destruction and remodeling. He hypothesizes that
nociceptive afferents regulate periodontal host responses under periodontal infection or orthodontic force to
control pathophysiological remodeling of alveolar bone. Dr. Chung’s research in these areas is aimed at
elucidating the mechanisms of chronic pain and alveolar bone remodeling, and their intersection with trigeminal
nociceptors. The anticipated outcomes will likely have significant impact, not only in elucidating basic
mechanisms but also in translational areas including development of novel methods to control chronic pain and
alveolar bone remodeling by regulating nociceptive afferents or nociceptor-enriched molecules."
10876333,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goals of this proposal are to investigate the mechanisms of bladder injury (hemorrhagic cystitis)
associated with BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) infection in children and young adults undergoing bone marrow
transplantation (allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, HSCT). BKPyV-associated hemorrhagic cystitis is
a complication for up to 25% of allogeneic HSCT recipients. Hemorrhagic cystitis leads to patient morbidity from
painful urination, prolonged hospitalizations, increased blood transfusion requirements, and invasive procedures
when urinary obstruction is present. Each episode of hemorrhagic cystitis accounts for 10 additional hospital
days and costs $70,000. In its most severe presentation, hemorrhagic cystitis may be associated with a higher
risk of death. BKPyV replication in the urine can be detected in 80% of HSCT recipients, but not all of these
patients will develop hemorrhagic cystitis. There are no antiviral therapies with proven efficacy against BKPyV
and current treatment strategies for hemorrhagic cystitis are limited to supportive care. A major barrier to
developing and testing novel therapies is our lack of understanding the mechanisms of bladder injury
in patients with BKPyV replication. This also prevents the identification of the patients at highest risk for
bladder injury. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis after HSCT is a
function of both BKPyV subtype and the host response to the virus. To test our hypothesis, we will study two
separate prospective observational cohorts: an existing group of 193 children and young adults who received an
allogeneic HSCT at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center or the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia with
already banked urine samples and an independent validation cohort of 200 children and young adults undergoing
allogeneic HSCT to be enrolled during the award period at these same two centers. The project’s specific aims
are: 1) to test whether the population or within-person BKPyV diversity is different between patients with and
without hemorrhagic cystitis after HSCT and to enroll the validation cohort; and 2) to test whether host cellular
responses or specific gene polymorphisms are different between subjects with and without hemorrhagic cystitis
after HSCT using proteomics and transcriptomics approaches. This study’s results are expected to increase our
understanding of the viral and host mechanisms of bladder injury after HSCT. The data from this application are
critical for identifying the patients at highest risk of hemorrhagic cystitis who would benefit from cellular therapies
and other targeted, future prevention or treatment strategies."
10880528,"Research Project, Project Summary
Intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) exact a heavy emotional and financial toll on society, affecting
an estimated 1 in 6 children in the US. Developing effective therapeutic interventions to treat IDD is a challenging
problem because a large number of environmental and genetic risk factors contribute to these diseases. Indeed,
IDD-associated genetic variants have been identified in more than 700 genes, but each variant is present in only
a small number of patients, and our understanding of how these variants contribute to the disease is limited. This
high degree of genetic heterogeneity and lack of mechanistic insights confound efforts to develop effective
therapies to treat IDD. If individual mutations can be grouped by shared molecular pathways, then targeting
these pathways may be efficacious in large subsets of patients. The overall goal of our proposal is to develop
CRANIUM, a platform that will read out the genomic, transcriptional, and neuronal phenotypic signatures of IDD
genes to reveal common pathways disrupted by IDD-associated mutations."
10880532,"Developmental Neuroimaging Core Project Summary

10880573,"ABSTRACT Baylor College of Medicine
Harris County, which includes the City of Houston, is among the 48 counties in the United States (U.S.) in
which more than 50 percent of new HIV diagnoses occur. There is an urgent need for innovative and
collaborative new approaches to HIV treatment and prevention in adolescents and young adults (AYA) in
Houston. The long-term goal of this research is to move the U.S. and Houston area closer to ending the HIV
epidemic by addressing the issues involved in successful prevention and treatment of HIV in AYA. These goals
align with Adolescent Trials Network (ATN) research objectives and Houston Consortium partnerships will
allow research to be conducted in AYA in all five priority areas of the ATN: improving HIV testing, preventing
new infections, engaging youth in care, improving treatment and treatment effectiveness, and reducing
adverse HIV health outcomes due to COVID-19. We plan to accomplish the following specific aims as a site for
HIV care, research, and prevention in AYA. Aim 1 – Conduct the Trials of the ATN as identified by the ATN
Executive Committee (EC) and Scientific Leadership Committee (SLC): Baylor College of Medicine (BCM)
ATN site has a longstanding research unit with staff with years of experience working with AYA, both in a
clinical trials settings and in the community, who are living with HIV (LWH) or are at risk for HIV. Aim 2 –
Participate in the Development of Trials: BCM's ATN Project Lead and staff have years of experience in
development and conducting of clinical trials in AYA and so will work in collaboration with the ATN Operations
and Collaborations Center (OCC) to develop and conduct the trials performed in the ATN. In addition, the BCM
Youth Community Advisory Board, (YCAB), which has had members who have been active in the ATN Youth
Advisory Council (YAC) and National CAB, Youth Experts and Advocates for Health (ATN-YEAH), will evaluate
and provide input on developing studies and provide and enhance ideas for future studies. Aim 3 – Provide
Innovation Regarding Successful Recruitment and Enrollment of Participants: As an ATN Site Consortium, we
have the structure, experience, and outreach to approach this aim at multiple levels with outreach in hard-to-
reach AYA including racial and gender minority and homeless youth. Aim 4 – Provide Sites (Texas Children's
Hospital and Harris Health Northwest and Thomas Street Health Center) as well as outreach within the
Houston ATN Consortium, local laboratory capacity, and pharmacy support in order to conduct the ATN trials
in collaboration with the OCC. Aim 5 – Continued evaluation and adjustment of Houston collaborative
consortium leadership model for meaningful and continued community engagement as reflected in ATN
research study participation of AYA at risk for or LWH. We anticipate the expected outcomes of improvements
in each ATN priority area along the continuums of HIV infection and prevention. This project is high impact
because it will provide the necessary consortium in impacted communities of AYA in a high-priority region of
the U.S. to collaborate with the OCC to make sustainable progress in reaching the ATN goals."

Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) is proposing to be the lead site for the Los Angeles Consortium. The
primary aim is to collaborate with Westat as the Adolescent Trials Network (ATN) Operations and
Collaborations Center (OCC) to successfully plan and implement ATN clinical research studies to meet the
priority areas as outlined in SLC RFA-HD-23-020. CHLA will leverage the strength of the Connect to Protect
Los Angeles (C2PLA) Coalition to lead a Research Advisory Committee of community, clinical, and academic
partners to:
1. Conduct the Research Projects identified by the ATN Executive and Scientific Leadership Committees;
2. Participate in the development of trials using our community, academic, and clinical partners in
 conjunction with the ATN Scientific Core to meet the needs of adolescents and young adults (AYA) at-
 risk for or living with HIV;
3. Contribute to innovative strategies within ATN V regarding successful recruitment and enrollment of
 participants through established collaborations among clinics, academic universities, community-based
 organizations, health departments, and other partners;
4. Provide sites with local laboratory capacity and pharmacy support; and
5. Establish a leadership model with meaningful and sustained community engagement efforts to ensure
 that research studies reflect where AYA are accessing prevention and care services.
Our proposed consortium will initially include nine partners who will bring their strength and diversity to a site
consortium that will include clinical, academic, government, community, and other partnerships. We have four
clinical sites that provide care to AYA living with HIV and at risk for HIV including mostly LGBTQ AYA of color
and two partners that currently house large databases of AYA living with HIV and at risk for HIV: ATN CARES
at UCLA and the NIDA UO1-funded Healthy Young Men/A Trans Youth of Color Study cohort at CHLA. We
have initially targeted four community-based organizations and the County of Los Angeles Department of
Public Health Division of HIV and STD Programs. Representatives of these groups and our AYA community
advisory boards will form an innovative leadership structure that is representative of our communities and can
provide leadership through protocol review, new protocol development, and guidance on recruitment and
retention. Based on decades of experience with clinical services and research with AYA, our proposed Los
Angeles ATN V Consortium is well suited to join the OCC and other city consortia. CHLA has exceptional
access to AYA likely needed in future clinical trials, decades of ongoing community partnerships, and an
outstanding track record for recruiting and retaining hard to reach AYA into clinical trials, including complex
medical interventions requiring investigational new drugs (IND), research laboratories, and pharmacy services."

Despite the substantial progress in the HIV epidemic, adolescents, and young adults (AYA) aged 13-24 years
living with HIV have worse health outcomes compared to any other age groups in the United States (US).
Children's National Hospital (CNH), provides comprehensive HIV prevention and treatment services to the
majority of AYA from the District of Columbia (DC) eligible metropolitan area (EMA) including three national
HIV epidemic hotspots—Washington, DC, and two Maryland counties (Montgomery and Prince George's).
Within DC, which continues to have the highest rates of new HIV infection in the United States, AYA have a
high HIV prevalence of 0.3%, and high incidence of sexually transmitted infections, placing them at substantial
risk for acquiring HIV. Through universal HIV counselling and opt-out screening, CNH reaches out to
thousands of AYA in the DC EMA yearly with HIV prevention and testing services. Currently ~300 primarily
minority Black AYA are in care at CNH for pre-exposure prophylaxis and antiretroviral treatment. CNH has a
longstanding history of collaboration within local, regional, and national scientific networks, including prior
participation in the Adolescent Trials Network (ATN). CNH has served as a successful recruitment site to
multiple industry-sponsored investigational new drug clinical trials and received an uninterrupted line of DC
Department of Health funding for HIV prevention and testing for more than 10 years. CNH has well-established
partnerships with local and regional community-based organizations and a strong track-record of leadership in
AYA HIV research within the broader local community of academic and community-based investigators,
including its active role in DC Center for AIDS Research and DC Cohort Study. The overarching goal of the
proposed ATN CNH consortium site is to contribute to the Westat-led ATN Operation and Collaboration Center
(OCC) long-term scientific impact while expanding its role in delivering direct public health impacts on the local,
regional, and national HIV epidemic among AYA. To achieve this goal, CNH will: (a) actively participate in the
development and implementation of the Westat-led ATN OCC clinical trials identified by the ATN Executive
and Scientific Leadership Committees; (b) deliver innovative solutions to optimize recruitment, enrollment, and
retention of AYA at multiple sites in the DC EMA in ATN studies and ensure local laboratory capacity and
pharmacy support; (c) propose novel concepts, approaches, and methodologies in implementation and clinical
science, and development and optimization of biomedical prevention and treatment tools for AYA; and
(d) meaningfully contribute to the Westat-led ATN OCC leadership model through sustained CNH site and AYA
community engagement, expanding network collaborations through established regional collaborations among
clinical, academic, community-based AYA focused partners, local DOHs, and schools. By participating in the
Westat-led ATN OCC, CNH is uniquely positioned to contribute to advancing the National HIV/AIDS Strategy
and the national plan of Ending the HIV Epidemic in the United States."

Despite advances in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) diagnostics, care, and prevention strategies,
infection rates continue to rise across the United States, particularly the medically underserved of low socio-
economic status, sexual and gender minority groups, and/or racial/ethnic minority constituency, and/or
substance abusing youth. There is an urgent need to reduce the number of new HIV infections among at-risk
youth and improvements in numbers across the HIV care continuum. The Adolescent and Young Adult
Research (AYAR) at Core Consortium will participate in the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS
Interventions (ATN) as it has since 2001. The AYAR consortium will continue to work collaboratively within the
ATN structure to assist in the development and implementation of interventional studies that address the ATN
scientific priority areas across the HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment continuum among adolescents and
young adults (ages 13-24) through primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention approaches. The consortium's
HIV experienced, multidisciplinary clinical and community-based staff will be responsible for ATN subject
recruitment, retention, and safety in our well-established adolescent HIV care program and consortium
network, with the use of innovative methods, to reach the most underserved and highest risk communities of
the Chicagoland area. They will continue to improve upon its leadership model with meaningful and
sustainable community engagement efforts, targeting high HIV prevalence areas, leveraging local health
departments and community partners in promoting and engaging youth in health care and research directed at
ending the HIV epidemic. The consortium will maintain and establish new Community Based Organization
(CBO) partnerships and conduct community outreach activities in targeted areas within Cook County's high
HIV-affected areas and with a focus on sexual minority groups. AYAR will continue to support CBOs via in-
person or virtual meetings and events, educational sessions, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing.
AYAR will continue to maintain an active research Youth Advisory Board (YAB) with regular meetings via in
person or virtual means. The consortium will increase sexual health education and awareness of HIV
prevention strategies and assist with linkage to care for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and HIV care. The
AYAR will provide site, laboratory, pharmacy, and community capacities, to support impactful research studies
identified by the ATN Executive Committee and Scientific Leadership Group, in collaboration with the
Operations and Collaborations Center (OCC). Our investigative team has decades of experience with
recruitment, prevention, and care of at-risk youth and large-scale longitudinal cohort studies. This study will
capitalize upon productive existing partnerships to articulate the drivers of the ongoing HIV epidemic among
the most vulnerable populations in the Chicagoland area in order to identify the most effective, expeditious,

center, which provides primary care for more than 9,500 youth 24 years of age and younger, with a focus on
the affiliated Sidney Borum Health Center, which specializes in the care of sexual and gender minority youth,
and the Public Health Programs that include programs focusing on health system navigation, drop in
HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening, harm reduction programs for PWID, and programs
addressing social determinants of health (e.g., housing and legal support). Additionally, we will utilize our
grants management and contract negotiation teams to ensure optimal execution of all logistical and budgetary
aspects of the grant. A primary member of the consortium will be JRI Health, which administers multiple
programs for HIV-infected and at-risk youth in Boston and throughout Southern New England, including
Providence, Worchester, and Southern New Hampshire. Other consortium members will include the Boston
Public Health Commission, Boston Public Schools, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH), and
collaborators in other local programs serving HIV-positive and at-risk youth. These partnerships will enable us
to meet the proposed research goals of the SLC. In this project, we aim to: (1) Convene regular meetings of
key consortium members to discuss new and ongoing protocols, to solicit their input regarding best practices
for recruitment, community engagement, and participant retention, and for community education; (2) Convene
a youth community advisory board (YCAB), which will provide input into youth priorities related to the work of
the ATN, and guidance regarding best practices for community engagement and education; (3) Ensure optimal
communication between local members of the FSC and the OCC and scientific leadership through routine
meetings of local consortium members and engagement of consortium members in meetings convened by the
OCC; (4) Actively participate in all relevant ATN activities, including providing site representatives to
governance committees of the ATN, and site investigators to represent the FSC on ATN protocols."

Youth (ages 13-24) living with HIV comprise one fourth of new HIV diagnoses in the United States (U.S.) and
have the lowest rates of engagement and retention in care and prevention, initiation of antiretroviral treatment,
and virologic suppression, increasing the risk of disease progression and transmission, with important public
health implications. These disparities threaten the U.S. government's target of ending new HIV infections by
2030, outlined in the Ending the Epidemic Plan for America (EHE). The Adolescent Trials' Network (ATN), the
only youth-targeted HIV network, combines expertise in clinical care and research to develop optimal
approaches to addressing the challenges facing youth at-risk for and living with HIV. Located in Baltimore,
Maryland, an EHE jurisdiction, the Johns Hopkins Adolescent Young Adult Research Equity for Adolescent
Care and HIV Consortium (JHU AYA REACH) has a long-standing overarching commitment to mitigate the
impact of HIV and improve health outcomes for AYA at-risk and/or living with HIV via a clinical research
program focused on integrated, cross-disciplinary studies of AYA-centered novel interventions (e.g.,
biomedical, management, strategy) that span from bedside to community. Synergies between clinical care
research, public health, and community, centered on AYA, substantially enhances relevance, improves
feasibility, optimizes success, and amplifies impact. The JHU AYA REACH infrastructure aims to optimize
these synergies ultimately uniting the scientific rigor (clinical trial design and implementation, outcomes,
interventions) with clinical expertise and real-world understanding, ensuring that research questions/answers
are relevant, implementable, and scalable. Led by Drs. Agwu and Sanders (Co-Project Leads), the JHU AYA
REACH, has a longstanding and productive involvement in clinical trials' networks and cohorts (ATN,
International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials' Group [IMPAACT]) with much of that
involvement overseen by Westat and JHU AYA REACH is home to a prolific group of diverse, collaborative
multidisciplinary investigators. The consortium includes an established network of community and
governmental partners increasing the likelihood of effective translation of the research outcomes. For this
application, we will: (1) Develop and conduct science that incorporates innovative approaches to addressing
the critical scientific gaps and questions impacting AYAs, particularly Black and Hispanic/LatinX AYA, at-risk
for or living with HIV; (2) Coordinate with diverse entities, affiliates, and stakeholders across the institution and
community, including AYAs, to ensure timely, accurate, and effective engagement in the proposed research;
and (3) En
sure that AYA voices and lived experiences are central to the research activities of the JHU AYA
REACH through active and purposeful involvement of AYA through the Youth Advisory Board (YAB) and other
forums. The JHU AYA REACH's expertise, experience, and goals directly align with the ATN enriching the
capacity to develop and conduct innovative and impactful interdisciplinary AYA-specific research, providing
added overall value to the proposed ATN."

The Tulane University Adolescent Medicine (TUAM) Consortium consists of community members, academic
institutions, government agencies, clinics, and community-based organizations (CBOs), that provide services to
adolescents at risk for or living with HIV. With a long history of successful collaborations with CBOs, agencies
and community members throughout New Orleans, TUAM plans to engage Consortium members with an
option to join with site leadership in monthly steering committee meetings to directly link the Consortium to
substantive research feasibility and ethics discussions as well as a way of making contributions to the decision-
making process. Direct community representation in research planning has been integral to our research
conduct. For instance, as part of the consortium, the community advisory board (CAB) consisting of mostly
sexual and gender diverse youth of color, provides feedback on research protocols, assists in planning
research processes, represents the site in research Network committees, and is active in community outreach
planning and participation. Tulane's solid research infrastructure facilitates and encourages the simultaneous
implementation of multiple investigational new drug (IND) and biobehavioral protocols without becoming
overwhelming. By interest and necessity, TUAM has designed and executed highly adaptive and diverse
approaches to recruiting and retaining youth in our research studies. Current recruitment and retention efforts
focus on social media-based approaches, but direct outreach in non-traditional settings will increase once
again as conditions allow. In New Orleans, creating events that appeal to young people has been an
organizing force for our consortium members; a way for collaborators to make their organization and projects
known; a way for researchers to be visible as community members; and a way to give back to our participants.
As one of the consortia within the Operations and Collaborations Center, the TUAM Consortium plans to:
(1) Conduct research projects that have been identified by the Executive Committee and Scientific Leadership
Committee; (2) Participate in the development of trials, engaging in ongoing research planning and the
development of implementation strategies that build on Consortium strengths; (3) Continue to develop multiple
and varied recruitment and retention strategies that resonate with youth; (4) Implement complex ATN research
protocols employing highly trained staff and an efficient research infrastructure that engages Consortium sites
for research, advocacy and guidance; (5) Provide sufficient laboratory capacity to process samples and
effective research pharmacy support; and finally (6) Establish a Consortium leadership model that ensures

Administrative Core. The Administrative Core will govern the Program, run the finances and operations,
coordinate between groups, and support the Program Project.
We propose a well-run Administrative Core with strong and experienced leadership that will be essential to the
success of the Program Project and the studies and cores it supports. Dr. Hashem El-Serag, Chair of the
Department of Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston will be the Director of the Administrative Core.
Dr. Fasiha Kanwal, Section Chief of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Baylor College of Medicine will be the
Associate Director. Both are highly experienced running Centers and Cores. One Program Project administrator
will provide the necessary support for day-to-day financial management and operations. An Executive Committee
and an External Advisory Committee will perform oversight. The Executive Committee will be composed of the
Director, Associate Director, Core Directors, and Project Leaders who will meet monthly. The External Advisory
Committee will comprise of 4 external experts in liver cancer biology, epidemiology, prevention as well as
coordinating center activities.
The Aims of the Administrative Core are: (1) to build a Core with strong leadership to manage the Program
Project; (2) to use optimized methods for managing the Program’s scientific, regulatory, and financial functions;
and (3) to support coordination and communication between Program investigators and outside advisors and

Development Core (BBDC) and Data and Analysis Core, and the Administrative Core.
The primary objectives of the BBDC are 1) to produce high-quality DNA, plasma, and serum for research
projects using standardized collection and processing procedures and 2) to spearhead biomarker assay
development and validation that supports the projects in the PP. The aims of the BBDC are to (1) receive,
process, and catalog all blood samples from patients participating in the THCCC; (2) Allocate and distribute
appropriate research samples to investigators and projects, and work with the biospecimen prioritization group
to prioritize samples; (3) Develop and conduct HCC biomarker assays and analyses as needed for Projects; and
(4) Maintain a biobank of well-annotated samples for future research.
The BBDC will serve as the central location to fully support these functions using previously developed standard
operating procedures. The BBDC will work closely with the Data and Analysis Core to maintain the sample
inventory database, produce labels with unique sample barcodes, and produce lists of patients with specific
characteristics, so the samples needed can be pulled for analysis. The BBDC will also provide up-to-date and
accurate data on sample availability and ensure that the Projects receive optimal samples for the proposed
analyses. Centralizing specimen processing and storage ensures consistent, high-quality sample preparation
that will help achieve the goals of the Projects and minimize costs. The BBDC will also ensure accurate
recordkeeping and guard patient protected health information. Importantly, the Core will provide expertise in
biomarker assay development and application, oversee sample preparation, profile additional targets and liaise
with institutional cores. Thus, the BBDC will provide indispensable services critical for the scientific and
operational success of the PP."

Core (DAC) and the Biospecimen and Biomarker Development Core (BBDC); and the Administrative Core, all
with the shared mission of stemming the rising tide of MAFLD-HCC.
Central to this PP is leveraging and expanding our multicity, ongoing prospective cohort of persons with MAFLD-
related cirrhosis, as well as a retrospective cohort identified in the national Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
datasets. The aims of the three projects require rigorous implementation of well-designed protocols for
coordination and implementation of patient enrollment and biospecimen and data collection. Further, they need
optimal, complete follow-up of patients with cirrhosis to determine if the participants developed HCC. The BBDC
requires support programs and systems to track samples between enrollment sites to identify and select
samples for testing related to specific projects. All three PP studies also require rigorous advanced methods
for statistical analyses and information technology. All these needs will be addressed by the DAC.
The goal of the DAC is to provide critical expertise and support in data management, coordination, statistics
and information technology for all projects in the PP. The Specific Aims of DAC are to provide the PP projects
and BDCC with (1) Management and coordination, including implementing and maintaining a Manual of
Operation (MOO) of the multicity, multisite prospective cohort; (2) Programming and systems support to
maintain central databases for PP Projects, track samples, design programs to monitor study data, and develop
electronic dashboards to ensure regulatory compliance and timely progress of PP Projects and Cores; (3)
Statistical expertise for programming, ongoing quality assurance, study design guidance, and analysis and
interpretation of data; and (4) Informatics technology to harmonize data collection efforts among PP
investigators and collaborators and to develop apps for users that interface with simulation models.
DAC members have extensive experience and expertise in the design and statistical analyses of variety of
study as well as continuity of skills, protocols and personnel related to the THCCC cohort. DAC will ensure
the all Projects and Cores achieve the overarching goal of reducing HCC related mortality."

Perinatal exposure to lead remains a highly relevant pediatric environmental health problem, despite tremendous
awareness and remediation efforts. Even at low levels, exposure to lead adversely impacts neurodevelopment;
however, children are not exposed to lead in isolation. Most children are chronically exposed to hundreds of
chemicals. Recent studies have found that pregnant women and children living in some areas of Durham, NC
have elevated exposures to both lead and cadmium. Our preliminary data demonstrate that lead and cadmium
are also elevated in surface soils in some areas of Durham, as are the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs). Metals and PAHs also commonly co-occur in contaminated sites (e.g., Superfund Sites and
Brownfields). Therefore, people living near these sites are exposed to mixtures of metals and PAHs
simultaneously. While lead is a well-studied neurotoxicant, little research has been conducted to understand co-
exposure to these compounds and their potential developmental impacts. The Duke University Superfund
Research Center (DUSRC) seeks to better address this data gap and contribute new information and resources
to better address potential health risks. Here we propose a biomedical project (Project 1) within the DUSRC to
address prenatal exposure to mixtures of PAHs and metals in a community with known co-exposure. We
hypothesize that prenatal exposure to metals and PAHs is associated with neurodevelopmental changes that
are greater than the impacts of lead alone. We will first characterize exposures in a cohort of 400 pregnant
women, leveraging resources available from an ongoing longitudinal study. Metals will be measured in maternal
blood samples collected during prenatal care visits, while PAHs (and other organic contaminants) will be
measured in silicone wristbands worn for a week in each trimester of pregnancy. Cognitive and behavioral
assessments will be carried out with children during the first three years of life using a novel personal monitor
and standard clinical assessments. Furthermore, we will use a novel geochemical isotopic tracing approach to
identify the primary sources of lead in a subgroup of the cohort that has the highest levels of exposures. This
project directly addresses Superfund Mandates 1, 2 and 3. It will use advanced techniques to investigate the
effects of hazardous substances on human health, while also developing new methods to evaluate lead exposure
risks and identifying the primary exposure pathway to support targeted exposure mitigation strategies."

Persisting neurobehavioral toxicity has been shown to result from early developmental exposure to many
different types of toxicants, including polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals. While the
developmental neurobehavioral toxicity of individual chemicals have been well-studied, their interactions have
not, despite the fact that people are most often exposed to toxicant combinations. Project 1 focuses on
understanding how developmental PAH exposure impacts neurotoxic effects of heavy metals. We will use an
effects-driven mechanistic investigation, working from the persisting neurobehavioral dysfunction caused by
developmental toxicant exposures back to determine the critical mechanisms that caused the neurobehavioral
toxicity. Interactions of two prototypic PAHs (benzo[a]pyrene and fluoranthene) and two heavy metals (lead and
cadmium) producing persisting alterations in locomotor activity, emotional dysfunction and cognitive impairment
will be determined. The mechanistic investigations will range from molecular (DNA methylation) to intracellular
(oxidative stress related to mitochondrial dysfunction) to intercellular (dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine
neurotransmitter impairments and microglial-mediated changes in inflammatory processes via IL-1β, 6, 10 and
related cytokines). At an organismal level, the importance of behavioral stress response potentiating
neurobehavioral toxicity to PAHs and heavy metals will be determined. Zebrafish will be used as a front-end
model to assess detailed dose-effect interactions of PAH and heavy metal neurotoxicity with isobolographic
characterization, charting interacting dose-effect functions. Rats will be used to determine the character and
mechanisms of persisting neurobehavioral impairment more directly relevant to humans, including sex-selective
effects. Working from this improved mechanistic understanding of the neurobehavioral toxicity, this project will
advance to the study of complex environmental mixtures. Project 2 will determine the efficacy of potential rescue
treatments using antioxidants, methyl donors and anti-inflammatory cytokines during the toxicant exposure.
These will be developed in zebrafish and verified with the rat model. Another important type of toxicant interaction
is sequential exposures. In an exploratory aim we will determine how early exposure to one neurotoxicant could
cause maladaptive development that would impair response to later exposure to another neurotoxicant. This
sequential change in toxicant exposure is important for understanding risks of changing exposures through a
lifetime. Project 2 will collaborate with the other projects, particularly regarding epigenetics (Project 3), oxidative
stress (Projects 3 and 4), behavioral impairments (Projects 1 and 4), complex environmental mixtures (Projects
1, 4, and 5), neurotransmitter analysis (Analytic Chemistry Core), mixture statistical evaluation (Data
Management and Analysis Core), and sharing information with the broader community (Community Engagement
Core) to enhance understanding of real world neurotoxic risks to toxicant mixtures and develop treatments to
reduce adverse neurobehavioral toxicity."

In ongoing work by this Project, we have found that developmental exposures to mitochondrial toxicants cause
neurotoxic outcomes in Caenorhabditis elegans, including morphological alterations in neurons, altered
behavior, and, in the long term, increased susceptibility to neurodegeneration. In line with the EPA, we describe
all of these as “developmental neurotoxicity (DNT),” because they result from exposures that occur during
development. Two important and overarching mechanisms of DNT are 1) changes to neurogenesis resulting in
altered cell fate, morphology, and connectivity (“hardwiring”), and 2) persistent changes to the function of
neurons that appear to be morphologically normal (epigenetic “programming”). Distinguishing these is
challenging; we propose a novel and powerful way to assess each possibility. We will begin with an in vivo yet
relatively high-throughput and economic model, C. elegans. C. elegans offers an additional, key benefit:
developmental neurogenesis is normally invariant, permitting clear identification of variation in hardwiring as well
as behavioral and stress-responsive changes without morphological alteration (programming). Work in C.
elegans will be followed by testing in human neuronal stem cells (hNSCs) that permit human-relevant DNT
testing, plus the opportunity to identify sex-specific differences and epigenetic modifications.
Relatively few chemicals have been rigorously evaluated for DNT. The paucity of information is even more
pronounced for chemical co-exposures, despite the fact that combined exposures are the reality. This lack of
testing of mixtures results partly from regulatory policy, and partly from technical challenges in laboratory testing
of co-exposures. Our combined in vivo-in vitro approach will permit us to rigorously test for DNT resulting from
both complex environmental mixtures, and from defined combinations of individual Superfund chemicals that we
will evaluate for non-additive effects. We will test the effects of the prototypical developmental neurotoxicants
Pb, Cd, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, singly and in combinations dictated by known environmental
concentrations. We will compare our outcomes in C. elegans and hNSCs, to those obtained by other Projects in
fish, rats, and people. Demonstration that C. elegans can be reliably used to investigate mixture DNT will add a
powerful new model for testing and regulation of environmental mixtures.
Finally, we will test the degree to which mitochondrial dysfunction, key to neurodevelopment, drives DNT by
these prototypical chemicals. These chemicals have multiple molecular targets, including but not limited to
different mitochondrial macromolecules. The fact that these chemicals individually all affect mitochondria and
neurons, but by different mechanisms, is why we predict synergistic interactions. However, while mitochondria
are known targets of these chemicals, the extent to which mitochondrial toxicity drives their DNT is not known.
Our work will establish the contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction in single and combined chemical DNT,
informing development of adverse outcome pathways and intervention efforts."

T cell immunity may be exploited through vaccination, immunomodulating therapies, and
engineered adoptive cell therapies to immunize against or control infections and cancer. However
repeated or prolonged stimulation can result in T cell dysfunction and senescence which impairs
protective immunity or allows disease progression. Establishing numerically robust, durable, and
functional T cell immunity and preventing or reversing T cell exhaustion remain substantial goals
in immunology that have significant clinical ramifications. Our preliminary data demonstrates that
repeated stimulation, even when punctuated by periods of rest, can result in senescence.
However, we also show that this fate can be avoided, allowing indefinite boosting across multiple
mouse lifetimes, while preserving function and durability. Additional preliminary data indicates
that T cells can adapt to become inured to exhaustion. The goals of this proposal are to determine
the underlying mechanisms that permit T cells to undergo indefinite clonal expansion while
avoiding functional exhaustion or proliferative senescence. Successful execution of the proposal
will inform our understanding of the regulation of immunological memory, vaccine development,
and immune therapies for chronic diseases.

10886026,"Up to 2/3 of youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit challenging and often dangerous behaviors,
including aggression and self-injury, that profoundly limits their access to community, educational, and
therapeutic resources. Risk for challenging behavior and its consequences (e.g., psychiatric hospitalization;
polypharmacy) increases during adolescence, particularly for severely affected youth with ASD (SA-ASD;
characterized by intellectual disability or minimal verbal ability). Identifying contributors to challenging
behaviors that can be modified using non-pharmacological and non-invasive approaches is a high priority for
clinicians, researchers, and family caregivers. Yet, SA-ASD youth are under-represented in research, which
restricts the potential for improvements for those who need it most. Sleep and the circadian regulation of sleep
are modifiable through behavioral and chronotherapeutic interventions. In typically developing youth, the
homeostatic and circadian regulation of sleep exhibits marked changes during adolescence (e.g., circadian
phase delay). These changes confer risk for sleep problems and challenging behaviors mediated in part by
changes in alertness, mood, and cognition. The proposed cross-sectional mentored study (K99) will evaluate if
circadian phase delay is associated with sleep problems and challenging behaviors in SA-ASD youth. The
study will be conducted in an inpatient psychiatric unit to facilitate training with, and enrollment of, SA-ASD
youth, a population that is difficult to study in the community. The study will serve as a platform for training in
(1) supportive techniques and non-invasive sleep measurement methods to increase participation of SA-ASD
youth in objective sleep and circadian science, (2) systematic coding of observed challenging behavior and
ecological momentary assessment methodology, (3) advanced analytic methods to model prospective
associations and individual differences, and (4) the process of intervention development to support future
intervention research. Training and lessons learned during the mentored phase will inform and support an
independent prospective study (R00) of associations between circadian phase, sleep, and challenging
behaviors in an independent sample of SA-ASD adolescents. The proposed study will follow SA-ASD youth as
they are discharged from a psychiatric inpatient facility and return home. Following a pre-discharge baseline
assessment in the hospital, in-home assessments of circadian phase and sleep and ecological momentary
assessments of challenging behavior will be conducted at 6 and 12 months post-discharge. The objective of
this study is to determine if circadian phase delay precedes the emergence/escalation of sleep problems and
challenging behavior. This work will set the foundation for future studies to compare prospective associations
between circadian phase, sleep, and challenging behavior across multiple comparison groups (e.g., higher-
functioning ASD and typical development) and evaluate the clinical utility of intervening upon circadian phase
to improve sleep and challenging behavior in ASD youth."
10883991,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Almost half of Americans over 30 years old have periodontitis, and 9% have severe periodontitis, which can
lead to bone loss, loss of teeth and osseointegration failure of dental implants. Current treatments for
periodontitis, including the standard scaling and root planing combined with systemic or local administration of
antibiotics, do not effectively address safety concerns, adequately prevent periodontal bone loss, or repair
damaged bone structures. Tissue engineering using stem cells/genes/proteins, combined with biomaterials, is
a promising strategy to address the challenges in periodontal bone regeneration despite the numerous hurdles
that still remain. Our primary goal, in collaboration with Dr. Shaoping. Zhang—a periodontist at University of
Iowa with extensive expertise in both basic and clinical research in periodontitis—is to develop an innovative
and translational biomaterials-based strategy to prevent and treat periodontitis-induced bone loss. PI Sun’s
pilot study indicates that the cell-permeable metabolite AKG (DMAKG) significantly inhibits osteoclastogeneis
and inflammation and promotes osteogenic differentiation in vitro. A hydrogel-delivered local DMAKG promotes
bone regeneration in aged mice, which is challenged by chronic inflammation. Moreover, we developed a new
vanillin/bioglass-based technique to fabricate an injectable chitosan hydrogel (CVB) with powerful antimicrobial
and osteogenic abilities. Thus, our central hypothesis is that an innovative, injectable, and biodegradable
chitosan hydrogel that locally releases the metabolite AKG can effectively prevent and treat periodontitis-
induced bone loss in a clinically relevant mouse model by simultaneously reducing bacterial infection,
inflammation, and osteoclastogenesis while promoting osteogenesis. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel
injectable DMAKG-releasing chitosan hydrogel that can reduce harmful microbial counts, inflammation, and
osteoclastogenesis while improving osteogenic capabilities in vitro. In Aim 2, we will establish the effectiveness
of a treatment for periodontitis-induced bone loss using a novel chitosan hydrogel-mediated DMAKG release in
a mouse model. At the completion of this exploratory/developmental R21 project, we will have developed a
novel periodontitis treatment using an injectable chitosan hydrogel that locally releases the metabolite AKG.
Our novel strategy will simultaneously reduce 1) bacteria growth, 2) chronic inflammation, 3)
osteoclastogenesis, and 4) promote osteogenesis, which are all important for effective treatment of
periodontitis, but current treatments have difficulty targeting them all. Our acellular biomaterials and metabolite-
based strategy for periodontitis treatment has greater translational potential than using biological mediators."
10886027,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The progression of cardiovascular disease has only recently been noted to involve changes in endothelial (EC)
metabolism. Atherosclerosis, a disease of vascular lipid accumulation and inflammation, is linked to a
metabolic switch of the endothelium. However, the regulation of this switch is incompletely defined. Small non-
coding microRNAs have recently been identified as regulators of inflammation and metabolism. For example,
microRNA-33 (miR-33) has been extensively implicated in lipid metabolism, yet its precise role in ECs is
unknown. Another master regulator of lipid metabolism, whose role in ECs is yet to be defined, is Liver X
Receptor (LXR). This proposal seeks to determine how endothelial-specific miR-33 and LXR regulate EC
metabolism and determine if their disruption affects atherosclerotic progression. miR-33 attenuates the
removal of cholesterol from cells while on the other hand LXR signaling promotes this process. Since
cholesterol retention is implicated in atherogenic processes in the endothelium, this suggests a pro-
atherogenic role for endothelial miR-33 and an anti-atherogenic role for endothelial LXR signaling. Additionally,
other miR-33 targets include enzymes in fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Since dampened FAO promotes
atherogenic EC processes such as the Endothelial to Mesenchymal Transition, this emphasizes another pro-
atherogenic role of miR-33. Notably, there are several points of possible crosstalk between miR-33 and LXR
signaling – namely that LXR can potentially regulate miR-33 expression and that the miR-33 targets include
LXR-induced genes – suggesting an interplay between their effects on metabolism. Therefore, the central
hypothesis is that miR-33 and LXRs operate in complementary fashions to maintain cholesterol and lipid
homeostasis in ECs, and that disruption of either of their signaling perpetuates atherosclerosis. This
hypothesis will be tested by addressing the following specific aims: 1) Investigate the role of miR-33 in
modulating EC lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis; 2) Delineate the contribution of LXR signaling to EC
metabolism and dysfunction in atherosclerosis. The use of novel mouse models with endothelial-specific
deletion of miR-33 or the LXRs will provide key insight into their role in atherogenesis. These aims will then be
further tested in vitro with a combination of state-of-the-art approaches upon miR-33 or LXR gain- or loss-of-
function to determine their regulation of EC metabolism. The proposed research is significant because it is
expected to identify two critical cell-autonomous regulators of endothelial metabolism and atherosclerosis.
Long-term, the goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of the regulation of EC metabolism and
identify novel regulators that can be therapeutically targeted in cardiovascular disease."
10886036,"This proposal addresses an exciting aspect of the biology of the delta opioid receptor (DOR), a prototypical
and clinically relevant G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that has long been considered a promising target for
treating pain and opioid addiction - two highly prevalent and comorbid diseases. Pain, one of the most common
symptoms presented at hospitals, is currently managed primarily by opioid analgesics that target the mu-opioid
receptor. While effective, their use is highly limited due to extensive side effects and a high potential for addiction.
DOR activation is a promising alternate strategy to reduce pain without causing addiction as the receptor is not
expressed much in the reward pathway. While the contribution of DOR-expressing neurons to distinct modalities
of pain is being heavily explored, the critical problem with this strategy is that effectively targeting DOR in vivo
has been difficult. DOR agonists activate the receptor and signal efficiently in isolated systems, but they show
poor analgesic responses in vivo. Centrally acting DOR agonists can inhibit pain at high doses in animal models,
but they also induce convulsions which preclude their use. This low analgesic effectiveness in vivo, which is a
critical limiting factor in developing analgesics targeting DOR, is being studied at various levels including at the
pharmacological and neural circuit level. However, we still do not fully understand the mechanisms underlying
this low effectiveness. Interestingly, DOR is unique when compared to many other GPCRs in that it localizes
mostly to intracellular compartments, with very little expressed on the cell surface. Our proof of mechanism
experiments showing that relocating DOR to the neuronal surface increases the effectiveness of DOR agonists,
suggesting the exciting idea that this intracellular location is what contributes to the low analgesic potency.
Understanding how and why DOR is intracellular in neurons is therefore critical to understand opioid physiology
and to develop DOR as a target for pain management. This proposal addresses the mechanisms and
consequences of DOR localization to intracellular compartments in neurons. We hypothesize that sequence-
specific interactions of DOR mediate retention of newly synthesized DOR in intracellular compartments in
neurons and allow compartment-specific signaling. We will test our hypothesis by determining the mechanisms
of DOR intracellular retention and testing the role of these mechanisms in compartment-specific DOR signaling.
Specifically, we will follow two aims, 1) To determine the mechanisms regulating DOR localization in intracellular
compartments, and 2) To investigate compartment-specific DOR signaling from intracellular membranes. We
will use focused candidate-based and unbiased genome-wide approaches to pursue these aims. Completion of
this project will validate a novel and physiologically relevant model for how DOR is localized to intracellular
compartments in neurons, identify key principles of DOR trafficking that will be broadly relevant across this family
of clinically relevant proteins, and potentially identify targets for new and untried strategies for targeting DOR in
pain management."
10886039,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
High blood pressure (BP) is the single largest risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality. Due to the well-
known limitations of clinic BP measurement, 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring with automatic cuff devices
has emerged as the gold standard method for hypertension diagnosis. Due to periodic inflation and deflation
even at nighttime, the cuff devices are disruptive to patients and could diminish the clinical value of nighttime
BP. Hence, cuff-less BP monitoring devices are being widely pursued. Pulse transit time (PTT), the time delay
for the pressure wave to travel between two arterial sites, represents the most promising cuff-less BP
measurement principle. However, there are several critical barriers in exiting PTT measurements such as: (i)
subpar sensor sensitivity; (ii) poor sensor adhesion; (iii) difficulty in converting PTT measurements into BP
readings; (iv) difficult in obtaining both diastolic BP (DP) and systolic BP (SP) measurements. To address
these issues, the overall objective of this work is to combine arterial tonometry and PTT principles to achieve
cuff-less 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. This will be achieved by placing two wearable tonometric sensors
at arterial sites (proximal and distal) and collecting high-fidelity tonometric waveforms as well as PTT values.
Our innovations in this work include: (a) integrating ionic liquid and microstructures (which can accommodate
ions under pressure) in piezo-capacitive sensor to enhance both the sensitivity and dynamic range; (b)
incorporating micropillars (mimicking gecko’s feet) at the sensor substrate to promote adhesion and improve
the fidelity of captured waveforms; (c) calibrating tonometric waveforms with pre-constructed PTT-BP
relationships (via postural changes); (d) calibrating tonometric waveforms to extract both DP and SP
continuously by leveraging the similar shape of arterial tonometric and BP waveforms. The specific aims are:
(1) to develop wearable sensors to obtain high-fidelity tonometric waveforms; (2) to promote the adhesion of
wearable patches; (3) to develop PTT-based calibration for extracting both DP and SP; and (4) to validate the
system in human studies. Our expected outcome is an accurate, cuff-less, 24-hour BP monitoring system.
Successful completion of this project can lead to new clinical practices for ambulatory BP monitoring and post-
surgery hypotension surveillance."

The burden of caring for persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (PwADRD) often falls on
unpaid caregivers, usually family members or friends. The mental, emotional, and physical stress associated
with such caregiving can lead to adverse health outcomes for the caregivers themselves. Recognizing this, our
project aims to develop and evaluate the Robot Interaction Scale of Engagement (RISE) system, a novel tool
designed to support these caregivers. By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence, the social robot, Pepper,
and the (Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer’s Caregivers Health) REACH Community and REACH VA
content, the RISE system aims to provide caregivers with essential information on effective care strategies,
self-care and coping, and stress management techniques. The goal is to enhance caregivers’ ability to provide
care and improve their well-being.
The specific objectives of the project are to: (1) tailor an AI-driven social robot to engage caregivers, (2)
evaluate user acceptance of the RISE system and the caregivers' attitudes toward it, and (3) assess the
accuracy and quality of the RISE system's interactions with caregivers. A pilot study is proposed to meet these
objectives, involving 30 caregivers at the O'Connor Senior Center in Knoxville, an institution with a diverse
visitor demographic. Participants will engage in full RISE sessions, interacting with the robot. Based on their
needs and preferences, participants will select knowledge modules, consisting of a presentation, question and
answer session, and knowledge quiz on behavioral topics such as bathing, wandering, or self-care and coping
topics such as asking for health, followed by their choice of stress management activity guided by the robot.
The sessions will then be evaluated using both quantitative and qualitative methods to assess user acceptance
and the system's accuracy. The findings from this pilot study will contribute valuable insights into the use of AI
and robotics in the caregiving context. This knowledge will inform the development of an optimized version of
the RISE system and will serve as a solid foundation for a larger, more comprehensive study in the future."

Hemifacial microsomia (HFM) spans an array of human congenital craniofacial birth defect syndromes
characterized by asymmetric malformation or underdevelopment of the orbits (maxilla and zygoma),
mandible, outer and middle ear structures, craniofacial nerves and soft tissue structures. These elements
are derived from cranial neural crest cells (NCCs) that populate the pharyngeal arches. HFM is the second
most common facial birth defect behind cleft palate, though unlike cleft palate, very few genes have a
proven association with HFM. One of the few genes found repeatedly in GWAS studies is the transcription
factor GATA3, which is the basis of this proposal.
 We have recently shown that GATA3 is required for facial symmetry, as Gata3 mutant mouse
embryos develop craniofacial defects resembling those seen in HFM, with one side more severely affected
than the other. However, our preliminary data show that while Gata3 mutant mouse embryos have several
changes in pharyngeal arch gene regulatory networks (GRNs), including expansion of Bmp4 expression
and reduction in Fgf8 expression, these changes are bilateral. Further, it is not clear if these represent
primary or secondary changes to GRNs and whether defects occur in NCCs before they reach the
pharyngeal arches. We hypothesize that GATA3 is required for two specific aspects of facial development:
1) to ensure sufficient migrating NCCs reach the first arch; and 2) to repress Bmp4 expression in the arch
ectoderm after NCC migration that would otherwise drive down Fgf8 expression and result in asymmetric
jaw morphogenesis.
 To address these hypotheses, we will pursue three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will perform a detailed
analysis of NCC migration, proliferation/cell death and later differentiation in Gata3 mutants. We will also
assess if disruption of internal organ asymmetry randomizes sided defects in Gata3 mutants. In Aim 2, we will
perform dual scRNA-seq/scATAC-seq (scMultiome) in wild type and Gata3 mutants to identify symmetric and
asymmetric changes in gene expression. We will correlate this with chromatin accessibility changes and
functionally analyze identified putative cis-regulatory elements in vivo. In Aim 3, we will reduce Bmpr1a
expression or increase Fgf8 expression in the mandibular arch of Gata3 mutant embryos to determine if either
approach can rescue the Gata3 mutant phenotype.
 Our long-term goal is to elucidate the basis of facial defects in the Gata3 mutant embryos and to
identify the cue or cues that result in asymmetry. Such an understanding has the potential to substantially
impact the quality of care for HFM patients and may potentially lead to avenues for future treatment
regimens designed to improve differences associated with HFM."

of proteins and peptides with much higher throughput and obtain more detailed information. More
importantly, the near IR wavelength extension to 1,600 nm and the addition of the magnetic CD
add-on will allow for the characterization of non-biomolecules, such as chiral small molecule
ligands, stable radicals, and metal centers in organometallic complexes, experiments that were
not previously possible at our institution.
 In addition, this instrument will support a capstone lab course where senior biochemistry
students will now have the chance to structurally characterize their proteins in a Course-based
Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) project. This hands-on experience will help prepare
students for future careers in academia and industry."

The proposed research aims to understand and discover the disparity of lung cancer development between
African Americans and European Americans, considering race and sex. For example, Among American Males,
the highest number of deaths occur from lung cancer, which is more deaths than kidney, pancreas, and prostate
cancers combined. African American Males have significantly higher death rates in lung cancer compared to
European American Males. Cigarette smoking is considered the strongest risk factor for lung cancer. However,
smoking alone cannot explain the disparity in lung cancer development between African American Males and
European American Males. The traditional cohort-based genome-wide association studies failed to identify the
African American Male-specific genetic locations susceptible to causing lung cancer. These studies are similar
to the current standard of medical practice, which largely relies on population-based epidemiological studies in
which individuals' genetic and epigenetic variabilities are largely ignored, resulting in population-based
conclusions. As a result, similar cancer types respond differently to the same treatment since each tumor has a
unique set of mutations. A personalized approach that can identify the patient-specific genetic and epigenetic
alterations leading to the disparities in lung cancer incidence and mortality may overcome the issues with
population-based studies.
Recent advancement in explainable artificial intelligence shows that by applying the local interpretation based
on game theory, one can discover the patient-specific significant genes related to a disease condition by
analyzing the gene expression profile of a patient. We propose to develop an explainable artificial intelligence-
based computational tool to explore multi-omics data in deciphering the lung cancer health disparity by
discovering, first, patient-specific disparity information, second, cohort-specific disparity information combining
individual disparity information, and third, disparity between two cohorts by comparing cohort-specific disparity
information, which will lead to the discovery of cohort-specific risk factors. The proposed tool can be applied to
find the cohort-specific risk factors by creating and comparing cohorts based on race and sex, such as African
American Males vs. European American Males, African American Females vs. European American Females,
etc. Thus, the developed tool will help solve the disparity puzzle that exists in lung cancer incidence and mortality
in different races and ethnicities. The proposed work is important since it will identify the heterogeneity of lung
cancer at a personalized level, which may help precision medicine's rational design. This improved precision
medicine design will help reduce lung cancer health disparities between different ethnic and racial communities
and maximize the therapeutic benefit in all communities."

Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), patients often develop significant disability in cognition, communication,
and behavioral or emotional stability. Problems with memory commonly occur following TBI and underlie some
of the morbidity accompanying each of these affected areas. In addition, there is some spontaneous recovery
after brain injury that occurs largely by unknown remodeling processes. It has been known for some time that
TBI elicits increased generation of new neurons in the hippocampus; the significance of this, however, has not
been clear. We have previously demonstrated that injury-induced neurogenesis underlies at least some of the
spontaneous recovery associated with TBI. ApoE is a gene that commonly occurs in 3 different isoforms in
humans and the kind of isoform expressed is predictive of recovery following TBI. We have identified ApoE as
an important regulator of hippocampal neurogenesis. The overall goals of this project are to determine how
ApoE directs injury-induced neurogenesis following TBI and to investigate mechanisms that regulate this
process. In Specific Aim 1, we will define the ApoE-dependent memory trace after injury to get a comprehensive
picture of how altered hippocampal circuitry affects the entire brain. For Specific Aim 2, we will use our recently
generated ApoE4 mouse to conditionally replace ApoE with human ApoE4 and prove our underlying hypothesis
that ApoE4 functions as a dominant negative. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanism
underlying ApoE’s role in injury-induced neurogenesis by exploring how microglial TREM2 regulates this process
via binding of astrocytic ApoE. This project will therefore serve as the basis for translational studies aimed at
using the presence of specific ApoE isoforms in humans to direct reparative therapy following serious brain
injuries such as TBI."
10875589,"The goal of this proposal is to investigate vestibular precision by quantifying the variability in behavioral
responses that result from the neural noise inherent to the peripheral and central vestibular systems. Because
neural noise contaminates the signals that are transduced by the ear and processed by the brain, vestibular-
mediated behavioral responses vary even when identical stimuli are provided. In this proposal, we focus on
vestibular precision in human subjects and investigate its sources, its effects on behavior, and its degradation
when the periphery is damaged and its potential plasticity. Specifically, we will investigate:
SA 1: Vestibular precision in normal subjects – physiology: A) We will measure the angular and linear
vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) using novel motion combinations that reinforce or cancel eye movement
responses, which will allow us to determine the distribution and magnitude of noise produced in the sensory
(canal, otolith) pathways and in the oculomotor pathway. We hypothesize that normal subjects will demonstrate
a bimodal distribution of noise with either sensory or motor predominance, and that subjects with more sensory
noise will demonstrate other behavioral characteristics that reflect this characteristic (e.g., higher perceptual
thresholds); and B) We will assay vestibular noise from trial-trial variations in the VOR and will compare VOR
dynamics with those predicted by a Bayesian model using the assayed noise. We predict variations in VOR
dynamics across subjects, age and stimulus amplitudes will be consistent with Bayesian processing of noise.
Potential confounding factors will be carefully controlled, including attention, fatigue, and non-vestibular cues.
SA 2: Vestibular precision after peripheral damage – pathophysiology: A) We will examine the changes in
vestibular precision that occur when one vestibular nerve is damaged (by a vestibular schwannoma, VS) and
after the damaged nerve is surgically sectioned, and will investigate if precision measurements can provide
evidence of pathologic noise produced by the damaged nerve and therefore help predict clinical outcome when
the nerve is sectioned. We hypothesize that changes in signal reliability due to the VS will be traceable to both
the reduced redundancy caused by loss of afferent fibers and to aberrant noise generated by the damaged
vestibular nerve and that changes in precision after neurectomy will correlate the outcome measures that
characterize patient disability; and B) We will examine the plasticity of vestibular precision in the oculomotor
and perceptual realms with the goal of determining if precision can be improved. Using novel training
approaches that provide challenging signal extraction tasks, we hypothesize that subjects will improve their
vestibular precision on the trained task. As secondary outcome measures, we will determine if training one
behavior generalizes to the non-trained behavior and if patient’s symptoms are affected by improved precision."
10877474,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The primary objective of this proposal is to assess a novel agonist of 4-1BB costimulatory pathway, SA-4-1BBL, as
a single agent for cancer immunoprevention in preclinical models that closely represent high-risk populations
susceptible to lung cancer resulting from environmental exposures. Advances in immunology led to the
development of immunotherapies with remarkable clinical efficacy against various tumors and put the immune
system at the forefront of the battle to prevent, intercept, and treat cancer. The perceived modalities for cancer
immunoprevention are vaccines, which are well-suited for virally-derived tumors because of the known nature of
target antigens. In marked contrast, the design of preventive vaccines against non-viral tumors for high-risk
populations faces a significant challenge due to the unknown nature of target antigens. Thus, a cancer
immunoprevention approach that does not require antigens and serves as a platform to prevent a wide range of
tumor types will be transformative. The 4-1BB costimulatory pathway has been targeted for cancer
immunotherapy because of the critical role signaling through this receptor plays in the expansion of CD8+ T cells,
acquisition of effector function, and long-term survival. The natural ligand, 4-1BBL, is a cell surface protein and
lacks costimulatory activity as a soluble molecule. As an alternative, agonistic antibodies (Abs) to 4-1BB have
been pursued for cancer immunotherapy and shown significant toxicity with limited clinical efficacy. We
hypothesized that a natural ligand would lack these attributes of Abs and generated an oligomeric form of mouse
ligand, mSA-4-1BBL. This molecule has robust costimulatory activity in soluble form and showed therapeutic
efficacy as the immune adjuvant component of tumor-associated antigens-based vaccines in various preclinical
cancer models without detectable toxicity. mSA-4-1BBL as a single agent also protects mice against various
tumor types, a highly significant and unexpected finding. Cancer immunoprevention efficacy is a bona fide
feature of mSA-4-1BBL, as agonistic Abs to 4-1BB receptor are ineffective. mSA-4-1BBL exhibits unexpected
efficacy in preventing cancer in mice lacking the 4-1BB receptor, suggesting the involvement of additional
immune pathway(s). A series of studies under 4 Specific Aims will be conducted to; i) identify additional pathways
targeted by SA-4-1BBL for cancer immunoprevention, ii) assess the efficacy of SA-4-1BBL in a tobacco carcinogen-
induced preclinical lung cancer model, iii) generate the human version of SA-4-1BBL and assess its efficacy against
lung cancer in a mouse model expressing human 4-1BB receptor, and iv) assess the cancer immunoprevention
efficacy of human SA-4-1BBL in a mouse model humanized with hematopoietic stem cells and transplanted with
patient-derived lung cancer. Various studies will be conducted to elucidate the mechanistic underlying of success
or failure of SA-4-1BBL-based cancer immunoprevention. Validation of SA-4-1BBL as an effective cancer
immunoprevention agent will be transformative and substantially change clinical practice for cancer treatment with
significant health and financial benefits worldwide."
10878694,"Title: From Biological to Social Processes: Interdisciplinary Training in Life Course Research
The poor overall health status of the US population in comparison with our high-income peers and the
staggering gaps in key measures of health and well-being by socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and gender
across the life course highlight the urgency at which we must address the factors and mechanisms that lead to
poor health outcomes. At the same time, it has become ever more apparent that scientific paradigms and
research approaches need to more fully incorporate the complex constellation of factors that fundamentally
influence health and well-being from birth through adulthood. For these reasons, novel integrative research,
from cells to society, is needed to better address the social and biological factors that cause persistent health
inequalities and result in relatively poor overall levels of health in US society. This renewal application of the
Interdisciplinary Training in Life Course Research (ITLCR) program proposes continuation of an innovative and
exciting predoctoral and postdoctoral training program that is producing and will continue to produce highly
trained interdisciplinary trainees who enter from either the social sciences or health sciences and who are
trained to conduct integrative work across these areas to address some of the country’s most pressing health
problems. Specifically, our program recruits promising trainees from both the social and health sciences and
focuses on five critical objectives. First, our trainees gain substantial expertise in a gap area of study outside of
their own discipline. Second, our trainees are immersed into interdisciplinary interactions, exchanges, and
experiences that broaden their scientific proficiency. Third, our trainees learn from leading experts on how to
conduct integrated biological/health-social population health research at the highest level. Fourth, our trainees
are provided with a first-rate structure and culture to produce their own integrative research at the highest level.
And fifth, our trainees are instructed on best practices in conducting integrated research with the highest
ethical standards in mind. Our trainees develop into creative and flexible scientists who are able to develop
new research pathways and create the innovative unifying frameworks that arise from crossing disciplinary
boundaries. Specifically, we seek continued support for seven pre-doctoral trainees (split between the health
and social sciences) and two post-doctoral trainees (one from each of the social and health sciences) for the
ITLCR. Since our program began in 2017, our trainees have been exceptionally productive; we have also built
a very diverse training program. With substantial guidance from the program directors and their cross-
disciplinary mentors, ITLCR trainees will continue to develop individually tailored training plans in either the
social sciences or health sciences, with the plan tailored to prior disciplinary training and to each trainee’s
research interests. In all, the ITLCR is creating junior scientists who are conducting cutting edge integrative
social and health sciences population research and who will be future leaders who will use these new
approaches to improve human health and well-being in the US and beyond."

The Emory Consortium for Innovative HIV/AIDS Vaccine and Cure Research in Nonhuman Primates aims to
define the mechanisms of the B and T Cell Biology of Protection from and Eradication of SHIV Infection. The
consortium brings together an interdisciplinary mix of highly collaborative, and productive investigators in a range
of HIV vaccine and cure disciplines to address the overarching hypothesis that the success of the prophylactic
HIV vaccine we have developed during the current program is due to a combination of a strong and sustained
systemic and mucosal immune response. This is comprised of multi-functional antibody and tissue resident CD8
T cell immunity, which upon encountering cognate antigen responds through conventional cytolytic mechanisms
and through modulation of the mucosal environment, such that responding HIV-specific CD4+ T cell are resistant
to infection. Moreover, we postulate that such a potent and balanced vaccine response will, in the context of
active latency reversing agents, reduce viral reservoirs and thus maintain suppression of virus replication
following cessation of highly active antiretroviral therapy.
The approaches in FOCUS 1, aimed at understanding the mechanisms of vaccine protection, will utilize state of
the art techniques and analyses to fully characterize and harness a novel population of tissue resident CD8 T
cells induced by our Heterologous Viral Vector vaccine (HVV vaccine) encoding Gag as an immunogen to
effectively synergize with the humoral immune response induced by our HIV envelope trimer vaccine (Protein
vaccine) co-delivered with novel adjuvants to provide long-term protection against heterologous SHIV challenge
even in the absence of strong neutralizing antibody response. In the later years we will use this novel,
mechanistic information to optimize the vaccine and move it closer to clinical studies. In FOCUS 2 we will pursue,
in SHIV-infected ART-treated macaques, the “shock and kill” approach to induce virus expression from latently
infected cells using latency reversal agents (LRAs) following therapeutic vaccination aimed at boosting virus-
specific immune responses able to clear CD4 T cells in which virus production has been reactivated. First, will
determine how the HVV+Protein vaccine behaves in ART suppressed macaques and then study its ability to
deplete the reservoir in the context of active LRAs and its impact on control of viral rebound.
These experimental approaches will be supported by an effective Operations and Management Support
component and three state of the art Centralized Research Resources to fully characterize the magnitude,
function, specificity and repertoire of the humoral response. Single cell analysis and transcriptomics will also
support characterization of innate and adaptive signals at the cellular level."

10878700,"We request continued support for a training grant for advanced (3rd-5th year) graduate students engaged in translationally relevant neuroscience research. The training grant will be open to students enrolled in the Neurobiology and Behavior Program as it has been in the past and from now on also in the Integrated Program in Cellular, Molecular, and Biomedical Studies at Columbia University. Support for five students is requested. The impetus for initiating and continuing this training program is the desire to provide the best possible preparation of our students to fulfill productive careers that draw on their scientific training. Specifically, we intend to enhance the training in statistical and quantitative methods, foster collaborative research, and encourage students to study commonalities between nervous system disorders. In particular, we will support a cadre of students carrying out cross-disciplinary research that has translational significance and relevance to neurological diseases. We will further favor and support such research that is directed by co-mentors with different experimental expertise. In addition, we will provide out-of-laboratory training of these and other students in the programs via a continuing course in ‘Professional Skills’ and a course in ‘Biology of Neurologic and Psychiatric Disorders’. We will also offer new value-added components in the program: Dr. Cheng-Shiun Leu, Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics, will provide one-on-one statistical counseling and advise for the trainees and their mentors, and he will participate in the regular meetings of the trainees with the PI. Another new component is a yearly quantitative approaches workshop and the requirement for trainees to participate in the Annual NINDS T32 Program workshop. These training opportunities are designed to be leveraged so that they benefit our supported trainees as well as other neuroscience-oriented students at Columbia. The program will be directed by the current co-PI Ulrich Hengst with the current co-PI Lloyd Greene stepping down at the end of the current funding cycle. The program will have 56 mentors at both junior and senior levels, who work in areas of relevance to translational neuroscience. Oversight will be provided by the directors of the Neurobiology and Behavior and the Integrated program, by the advisory committee of the Neurobiology and Behavior program, and by feedback from current and past students supported by the program. In the first 9 years of the program, 25 students have been supported with mentorship/co-mentorship by 25 different faculty. Publication records, thesis completion, retention rates, success in gaining outside support, continuation in science careers, increasing numbers of qualified and co-mentored applicants, and student feedback all indicate that the program is meeting its goals. This and the opening of the training grant to students from the Integrated program support the request to increase the number of supported students to five from the current number of four."
10878822,"Abstract
Enduring cognitive, somatic, and emotional impairments, including difficulties with memory, attention, and
learning, are reported as major contributors to reduced quality of life from patients living with a traumatic brain
injury (TBI). Previous preclinical studies highlight the contribution of altered neurotransmission and synaptic
dysfunction in the development of cognitive impairments after a TBI. We recently identified a novel synaptic
pathology in which the density and distribution of the intrasynaptic vesicular pool is drastically reduced after an
experimental TBI, with direct implications for impaired neurotransmission and cognition. A similar finding of
altered vesicle docking was observed after low intensity blast injury, suggesting these alterations may occur
across a broad spectrum of injury severity. Under normal conditions, neurotransmitter-containing vesicles are
replenished and the vesicular pool is maintained through the primary recycling mechanism of clathrin-mediated
endocytosis (CME). In the synapse, clathrin light chain (CLC) plays a central role in vesicular recycling through
interaction with clathrin heavy chain and CME associated proteins for vesicle formation and replenishment of the
vesicular pool. The effect of TBI on CLC and the contribution of CME deficits in synaptic dysfunction have not
been examined. We provide preliminary data highlighting reductions in CLC and CME proteins for weeks post-
injury in a rat model of controlled cortical impact (CCI). We also provide novel evidence of impaired hippocampal
evoked neurotransmitter release, a functional readout of vesicular pool integrity and CME function. We
hypothesize TBI-induced reductions in CME impairs the vesicular pool and neurotransmitter release, and that a
targeted strategy to promote endocytosis improves neurotransmission and cognitive function after TBI. We
propose utilizing innovative approaches to mechanistically interrogate the role of CLC and CME in post-traumatic
synaptic dysfunction and investigate the functional effects of targeted therapeutic intervention on CLC
abundance and CME function. In Aim 1, the effect of TBI on regional and sex-dependent changes in CLC and
CME will be assessed in the early to subchronic recovery period following CCI. In Aim 2, we will examine the
effect of a targeted strategy to increase CLC expression using neuron-specific adeno-associated viral modulation
on CME function on protein readouts, evoked neurotransmission and cognitive function following CCI. Aim 3 will
utilize an innovative and integrative Quantitative Systems Pharmacology approach to computationally model
gene changes in network map pathways altered after TBI and to identify perturbed pathways responsive to AAV-
CLC modulation after TBI. Successful completion of this work will bridge an important knowledge gap in
understanding the detrimental effects of TBI on the synapse and identify CLC and CME function as a novel
therapeutic target to promote functional recovery after a TBI."
10878827,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Some of the most challenging problems in biology and disease concern dynamical features of the
cell. The Wnt pathway is one of the most important developmental and cancer pathways.
Control of growth and size is a universal property of all cells, whose dynamics are hard to
measure accurately and poorly understood. The Wnt pathway is made up of conserved scaffolds
and enzymes that control the stability of catenin, which regulates important developmental
genes. Cell growth control, responds to metabolism and differentiation in complex physiological
circuits. Components of the Wnt pathway have been long known but how the Wnt signal
traverses several kinetic steps before interacting with the catenin is still unclear. We are trying
to understand the Wnt pathway from: 1) single molecule imaging of fluorescent chimeric
proteins knocked into the endogenous loci, thereby preserving the exact level of expression and
transcriptional regulation and 2) the development of an in vitro system that preserves the
kinetic response of the downstream events of the pathway. From the in vitro system we can
assay purified proteins, and assess their activity. We can quickly isolate complexes and study
their posttranslational state, and potentially determine the structure of kinetically important
forms by Cryo-electron microscopy. We have in the past and will in the future combine
mathematical modeling with biochemistry to identify key features of this system. For cell size
control we have used quantitative methods to define the cell’s structural and physiological state.
We found that mammalian cell size is controlled, not just at G1/S, but throughout the cell cycle
by feedback from cell size onto growth rate. How cells know how large they are and regulate
their growth is still a mystery. Further understanding will be facilitated by two tools we
developed: computer enhanced Quantitative Phase microscopy (ceQPM) and Normalized
Raman Imaging (NoRI). The former is the most accurate method for measuring cell dry mass
for attached cells. The latter can also independently measure protein and lipid mass densities
and total mass of cells, even deep within tissues. Furthermore, NoRI can measure the rate of
protein synthesis and degradation at the single cell level within tissues or in culture in real time.
We will use ceQPM and NoRI simultaneously with cultured cells to measure protein synthesis
and turnover as a function of cell size and as a function of position in the cell cycle, coupled with
pharmacological, growth factor, and nutrient perturbation to identify pathways involved in
sensing size and regulating growth. The mechanism of cell size control in differentiated organs
under different nutritional states in mouse tissues will also be explored with NoRI."
10873798,"The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis regulates puberty initiation and reproductive function. The timing
of puberty initiation is associated with risks for development of a wide range of diseases in adulthood, including
obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular/cardiometabolic disorders, and cancer. Pubertal development is a complex
process that is regulated by the activity of the HPG axis and is influenced by genetic, nutritional and
environmental factors. The HPG axis is active in the embryonic and neonatal stages of life; it is then suppressed
during childhood until reactivation at the time of puberty. Premature re-activation of the HPG axis results in
central precocious puberty (CPP). The precise mechanisms that regulate GnRH secretion to constrain the HPG
axis during infancy and childhood and subsequently trigger puberty initiation remain elusive. Genetic studies of
patients with reproductive disorders have led to identification of genes that regulate GnRH secretion and have
increased our understanding of the neuroendocrine regulation of reproductive function. We used an unbiased
approach to identify loss-of-function mutations in MKRN3 in patients with CPP, linking this imprinted gene with
the reproductive axis for the first time. Mutations in MKRN3 are now recognized to be the most common genetic
cause of CPP. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the molecular, cellular, and physiologic
mechanisms by which MKRN3 controls the timing of puberty onset. We hypothesize that MKRN3 acts in the
hypothalamus to inhibit the reproductive axis. In the first aim of this proposal, we will study the roles and
mechanisms of action of MKRN3 in male and female neural development and synaptic plasticity during puberty.
In the second aim, we will examine candidate targets of MKRN3, including KISS1, NKB, IGF2BP1 and LIN28B,
as well as mRNA targets, in the regulation of the reproductive axis. In the third aim, we will identify new MKRN3
targets and leverage mutations in key protein domains identified in patients with CPP to investigate the roles of
different MKRN3 domains in protein function. The successful completion of these aims will help us to understand
the actions of MKRN3, a novel regulator of GnRH re-activation, in the neuroendocrine control of pubertal timing.
A better understanding of the role of MRKN3 may also identify novel factors involved in the neuroendocrine
control of reproduction and lead to the development of new tools for the management of pubertal and
reproductive disorders."
10873799,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this K08 application is to provide Dr. Jonathan Chou, an Instructor of Medicine at UCSF, with the
skills he will need to become an independently-funded laboratory investigator. Dr. Chou proposes to elucidate
the regulatory mechanisms of NECTIN4, the target of a newly approved antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) in
metastatic urothelial cancer called enfortumab vedotin (EV) and identify mechanisms of resistance using PDX
and metastatic biopsy samples. The proposal builds on Dr. Chou’s recent work, which showed that NECTIN4
expression is enriched in luminal subtypes of bladder cancer, and that increasing and decreasing NECTIN4 can
enhance EV sensitivity or lead to resistance, respectively. Dr. Chou hypothesizes that the transcription factor
PPARG, which regulates luminal bladder cancer cell identity and integrates fatty acid signaling, is a direct
regulator of NECTIN4 and that transiently augmenting NECTIN4 expression in urothelial cancer cells will
enhance the efficacy of NECTIN4-targeting therapies. In Aims 1 and 2, Dr. Chou will elucidate the mechanism
underlying this regulatory pathway and determine whether sensitivity to NECTIN4-targeted therapies can be
enhanced by directly modulating the PPARg pathway using pharmacologic approaches, biological modifiers and
dietary alterations. In Aim 3, Dr. Chou will determine whether loss of PPARg or alternatively, activation of the
EMT-associated TGFb pathway downregulates NECTIN4, thus leading to resistance. He will leverage EV-
resistant cell lines that he has generated, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models (established from minority
patients treated at UCSF), as well as metastatic biopsy samples from UCSF patients treated on EV, to
accomplish this Aim. Dr. Chou’s training and research plan includes a combination of structured coursework and
workshops, one-on-one tutorials, and hands-on research experience that will all take place at UCSF, a world-
renowned NCCN Cancer Center with a history of excellence in basic and translational cancer research. Dr.
Chou’s training plan will complement his existing expertise to build a strong foundation in the following areas: 1)
bladder cancer biology; 2) preclinical modeling of ADCs and adoptive T cell therapies; 3) cancer metabolism and
drug resistance; and 4) genomics and next-generation sequencing methods and analysis. The project will be
conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Felix Feng, Professor of Radiation Oncology and Associate Director for
Translational Sciences, and co-mentored by Dr. Alan Ashworth, Professor of Medicine and President of the
UCSF Cancer Center. He has assembled a distinguished advisory panel with complementary expertise to guide
his research and career path. At the completion of this award, Dr. Chou will have the relevant didactic and
research experience to become a leader in bladder cancer models, therapeutic targeting strategies and genomic
approaches to investigate drug resistance, including to ADCs. If successful, this project will also provide a
translational opportunity from the laboratory to the clinic, to utilize dietary modifications and thiazolidinedione
drug combinations to augment responses and potentially reverse resistance to NECTIN4-targeting therapies."
10873800,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Endolymphatic hydrops (EH), a hallmark of Ménière’s Disease, is a cochlear disease caused by either an over-
production or under absorption of endolymphatic fluid. As a result of this excess of endolymph, the membranes
bounding the endolymphatic space are distended outwards. These notable alterations in cochlear morphology
cause disruptions in cochlear mechanics. The early identification and monitoring of EH is critical to preventing
progression of this, oftentimes, debilitating auditory/vestibular disease (which is episodic in nature). Clinical
diagnosis of EH is primarily made via symptomology, with the most reliable diagnostic marker being a fluctuating,
low-frequency sensory hearing loss. EH typically progresses to sensory deficits that no longer recover, resulting
in permanent hearing impairment that can eventually span across the audible frequency range. Therefore, early
identification and monitoring of the disease process is critical to preventing its progression.
Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are an ideal monitoring tool. OAEs are low-level sounds measured in the ear
canal that have been shown to gauge cochlear function and dysfunction with high accuracy. Along with recent
advances in this objective, efficient, and noninvasive probe of cochlear function, OAEs have the potential to be
a powerful tool in improving the efficacy of EH diagnosis, given the human cochlea cannot be accessed or
manipulated for direct study. We can now measure two distinct classes of emissions jointly — OAEs arising from
nonlinear distortion (distortion product OAEs) and OAEs arising from coherent linear reflections (stimulus-
frequency OAEs) using rapidly sweeping tones. The purpose of this work is to assess the diagnostic utility of
such a Joint-OAE Profile in identifying and monitoring EH while also exploring the mechanism of disease through
perceptual tests and phenomenological modeling to improve the efficacy of EH diagnosis in humans.
This K01 proposal will first probe cochlear changes during EH using a Joint-OAE profile – a profile comprised of
the two classes of emissions measured and analyzed together to access both generation processes (Aim 1).
Additionally, we will explore the underlying mechanisms of EH by determining whether EH causes shifts in the
cochlear frequency-place map using both a perceptual task (binaural pitch matching between the healthy and
diseased ear within an individual) and physiological measurements of SFOAE latency (or group delay) (Aim 2).
Finally, data collected from Aim 1 and 2 will be directly compared to model predictions that explore the
mechanical effects of EH on the cochlear partition and the consequences for OAE generation (Aim 3).
Combined, this physiological, perceptual, and computational approach to understanding endolymphatic hydrops
is a comprehensive and bold attempt to understand its clinical manifestations and disease timeline, as well as
its underlying mechanisms of pathology."
10880374,"This application is the second renewal application for the Vascular Surgery Research Training
(VascTrain) T32 Program. The VascTrain program was initially established in 2010 to enhance clinically
relevant basic and translational research in vascular surgery trainees and nonclinician trainees with a specific
interest in the study of vascular disease and treatment. The program supports 3 training positions each year (6
total positions) with two positions designated for vascular surgery residents and the third position for a trainee
from other surgical specialties or institutions or a nonMD post-doctoral fellow. The same number and
distribution of positions is being requested in this renewal application. The training faculty is composed of 27
trainers from a number of Departments including Surgery, Cardiac Surgery, Plastic Surgery, Bioengineering,
Chemical Engineering, the CTSI, Critical Care Medicine, Medicine, Cell Biology, Computational Biology,
Immunology, Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, and Pharmacology. The mentors have been selected for
their expertise in their areas of investigation as well as for their skills in mentoring.
 The focus of the training is on cardiovascular disease and is designed to cover three major tracks:
Vascular Biology, Inflammation, and Drug Discovery; Bioengineering, Regenerative Medicine, and Vascular
Imaging; and Clinical and Translational Research related to comparative effectiveness, outcomes, vascular
disease epidemiology, and health services research. While these tracks appear to be distinct, training can be
customized to incorporate related elements of these areas. In the clinical research track, the trainees will
obtain a master’s degree of Clinical Research that can be customize to desired area of interest. Trainees in
the Vascular Biology or Bioengineering tracks are encouraged to take coursework as needed to supplement
the laboratory training. Careful selection of a team of mentors that will best support the development of each
trainee will be key to the success of the trainees.
 In the first two funding cycles, the VascTrain Program was very successful in recruiting a diverse group
of trainees to the program who have demonstrated excellent productivity and retention in academic careers
with a focus on vascular research. The program continues to evolve with the recruitment of new training
faculty who will further enhance the training experience. The training plan will undergo changes to better
develop translational skills, incorporate individually designed curriculum in Responsible Conduct in Research,
and focus on unique career development skills for the MD and PhD trainees. The training curriculum has been
enhanced in this renewal to include career coaching and wellness programs as well as bridging opportunities
to assist in the retention of trainees in research related career pathways."

This application seeks continued support for a successful predoctoral Cancer Biology Training Program (CBTP)
at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, with a sole focus on basic, translational and clinical cancer
research. The Program is administered by the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer, a major component of
the NCI-designated Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center (FPBCC), which is one of only two NCI-designated
cancer centers in a five-state region from North Dakota to Oklahoma. As such, the CBTP plays an important
regional role in training future basic and clinical scientists for a career in cancer research. The continued success
of the CBTP over the past four years reflects a major expansion of the Cancer Center, with an increase in state-
of-the-art research space, a growing faculty, and a robust research base. Institutional commitment to the
Program remains strong. The opening of a new, integrated cancer research and clinical facility (the FPBCC
complex) in 2017 challenges trainees to consider how their research may be translated into improvements in the
diagnosis and treatment of cancer on a daily basis. The NCI Training Grant has been a major catalyst for the
success of the CBTP, which attracts a large national pool of predoctoral trainees and currently has 76 students
in training, over 60% of whom are training grant eligible. Twenty-nine CBTP mentors have a wide variety of
expertise in cutting-edge basic, translational and clinical cancer research and a strong track record of mentoring.
Translational research by CBTP faculty in biomarker discovery and therapeutic development for
pancreatic/gastrointestinal cancer is internationally recognized, and a Rapid Autopsy/Organ Harvest Program
provides a unique collection of specimens for studies on pancreatic cancer. Research strength in hematological
malignancies and hormone-driven cancers is also available to trainees. During the reporting period, major new
initiatives were implemented to invigorate the Program, keep pace with modern developments, and enhance the
distinctiveness of NRSA-supported training. New courses were added to a restructured curriculum, junior
investigators were included as mentors, new research-related training opportunities were offered, and a more
stringent student selection process was put in place. The success of these initiatives is reflected in the strong
publication record of our trainees, low attrition rates (<5%), a time to graduation of 5.2 years, strong outcomes,

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted lives and affected behavioral health of many. Unhealthy changes in
substance use are a great concern. Early data indicate substance use has changed during the pandemic,
particularly for some sub-groups of the population. This project aims to examine changes in cannabis, alcohol,
and tobacco use and related health risk behaviors (i.e. driving while—or riding with a driver—under the
influence of cannabis, alcohol, and simultaneous effects of cannabis and alcohol) during the course of COVID-
19 pandemic among young adults in Washington State. Specifically, we will address the following questions:
What are the patterns of young adult substance use during the pandemic and how do these relate to use
before the pandemic both in terms of individual trajectories and normative patterns over the course of young
adulthood? What are the predictors of escalation of use vs. desistance from use during the pandemic and what
is the role of pandemic stressors in these processes? How do community-level differences in access to
resources and access to substances relate to patterns of substance use during the pandemic? To answer
these questions, we will use data from the WA Young Adult Health Survey (YAHS) that we collected over the
past 7 years with funding from the WA State’s Division of Behavioral Health and Recovery. YAHS is an
accelerated longitudinal cohort sequential study of young adults ages 18-25, with cohorts added annually and
followed over time (2015-2021). Two cohorts were added after the onset of the pandemic, and five cohorts
have longitudinal data spanning the time from before to during the pandemic. These data will be linked with
community-level variables (e.g., neighborhood disadvantage, availability of substance use-related outlets and
services) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will assess changes in patterns (e.g., mode of use,
sources, frequency, and amount) of cannabis, alcohol, and tobacco use, simultaneous cannabis and alcohol
use, and SU-related risk behaviors (e.g., driving while intoxicated) from before to during the pandemic. The
role of community-level factors and differences by socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., sex, sexual and
gender minoritized status, race/ethnicity, college student status) in these changes will be examined. Moreover,
we will examine within-person changes in risk factors such as norms and perceived harm of cannabis, tobacco,
and alcohol use and COVID-19 pandemic related stressors by socio-demographic and community-level
characteristics. Finally, we will assess within-person changes in substance use and related risk behaviors (e.g.,
driving while intoxicated), focusing specifically on initiation, escalation, and desistance and their predictors and
potential explanatory mechanisms. Findings will inform planning of prevention and intervention efforts aimed at
improving health and reducing problem behaviors."

Genome-wide association studies have discovered thousands of genetic variants associated with phenotypic
traits such as disease risk. Most of the associated variation lies within non-coding regions of the genome and
the causative effects of those variants remain largely unknown. The sparsity of knowledge on interactions
between the coding and non-coding regulatory parts of the genome makes the prediction of variant function
solely from genome sequence and location impossible. We propose to experimentally uncover the functional
relevance of genetic variants at a large scale, by perturbing variants and genetic elements containing variants,
and reading out the direct consequences of those perturbations on gene regulation. To this end, we propose to
apply our recently developed CRISPR/Cas9 functional genomics screening technology with targeted single-cell
transcriptomic readouts (targeted Perturb-seq or TAP-Seq in short) to enable systematic interrogation of non-
coding regions and genetic variation therein. First, we will apply our targeted Perturb-seq to decipher the
regulatory circuitry encoded on an entire human chromosome by systematically perturbing all major genetic
elements (enhancers, protein-coding and lncRNA genes). This extensive data set will enable to decipher the
complex regulatory networks controlling gene expression on the selected chromosome. Next, we will uncover
causal regulatory variants in these regions by coupling high-throughput precision genome editing to
simultaneous single-cell genomic and transcriptomic readout. Using this novel approach, we will be able to
decipher the functional impact of genetic variants on gene expression and derive rules by which genetic variation
perturbs gene regulatory processes. We will integrate the generated data with available functional genomics
data, such as transcription factor binding (ChIP-seq), chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq, DNAse-seq) and
interactions in 3D (Hi-C), in order to train machine learning models to derive rules of the observed regulatory
interactions. These models will be applied to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulatory logic,
and to predict regulatory interactions and variants throughout the genome and across cell types. Selected
predictions will be experimentally validated using the established perturbation technologies, to verify clinically
relevant predictions and improve the performance of the predictive models. Taken together, this project will
answer fundamental questions in gene regulation, uncover the mechanisms by which genetic variation impacts
gene expression, and create datasets and computational models as valuable tools for interpreting results from
GWAS, eQTL and clinical genomic studies."

10884319,"Aging is associated with cognitive decline, which can manifest pathologically as age-related dementia. Aging is
also the major risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease. There is currently no effective treatment
for age-associated dementia and no therapies for Alzheimer’s disease. Challenges associated with brain
disorders include a lack in understanding of the underlying mechanisms and poor accessibility of the brain due
to the blood-brain barrier. Over the last decade, we have been studying meningeal spaces and their relevance
to brain function. Our long-standing interest in the meninges and its role in brain function has led us to
characterize meningeal lymphatic vessels and to observe many intriguing changes in meningeal immunity with
age, and accordingly to raise the questions: are meningeal immune and lymphatic alterations relevant to age-
related cognitive decline? If so, could meningeal lymphatic vasculature or meningeal immunity be therapeutically
targeted to alleviate age-related dementia and/or Alzheimer’s disease? Here, we are proposing to test our overall
hypothesis, that age-related impairment in meningeal lymphatic function results in impaired meningeal blood
vasculature (presumably through build-up of waste products), collectively leading to abnormal meningeal
immunity, which subsequently results in age-associated impairment of cognitive function. We propose that
improving meningeal lymphatic function (or directly targeting the immune system and/or its soluble mediators)
may be a plausible therapeutic approach for age-associated cognitive decline. Three specific aims were
designed to elucidate the role of meningeal vasculature and immunity in age-associated cognitive decline,
dementia, and mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease using state-of-the-art imaging, surgical and
pharmacological techniques in mice, as well as a validation of select findings in human dura specimens from
fresh autopsies. Specific aim #1 will establish whether dysfunction of meningeal lymphatics may exacerbate the
aging phenotype of meningeal blood vasculature; specific aim #2 will define the changes occurring in meningeal
immune cells upon vascular dysfunction; specific aim #3 is a therapeutic aim wherein several approaches to
boost healthy meningeal immunity—and thus improve cognitive function—will be tested. Understanding how
meningeal vasculature and immunity are changing with age and in diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, has
broad implications in numerous neurological conditions associated with aging. Our findings, therefore, have
significant potential to uncover the etiology of and identify novel therapeutic targets for age-related dementia and
Alzheimer’s disease.

In order to fully grasp the molecular origins of genome instability, the field must understand at a molecular level
how centromeres work to promote the stable transmission of chromosomes. Genome instability underlies a
variety of human pathologies, including cancer and reproductive aging. Our long-term goal is to determine how
the evolutionarily conserved cohesin complex maintains genome integrity through its roles in chromosome
segregation, chromosome organization, and double-strand break repair. Loss of sister chromatid cohesion is
speculated to be a major contributor to chromosome instability. The objective of this application is to produce a
molecular model for how cohesin operates at individual human centromeres to achieve centromeric cohesion
and accurate chromosome segregation. The central hypothesis is that cohesin and DNA catenation together
create centromere-unique landscapes of sister chromatid cohesion to prevent chromosome instability. The
variation in human centromeres and centromeric cohesion may therefore impact the transmission of each
chromosome. We will test the idea that centromere-specific cohesion must be considered as a genetic
determinant of sister chromatid cohesion and segregation in order to have a complete model for how
chromosomal instability occurs through two specific aims: 1) discover the landscape of centromeric cohesion at
individual human centromeres and 2) examine how chromosome centromeric cohesion maintains euploidy.
Under the first aim, calibrated paired-end ChIP seq will be used to map cohesin binding relative to kinetochore
proteins and human centromeric arrays in human tissue culture cells. This approach will be complemented by
superresolution imaging of the same three components (centromeres, kinetochores, and cohesin) in cells, and
will include imaging-based determination of centromere-specific cohesion. Together these approaches will
produce a linear and 3D map of cohesion within and around individual human centromeres. In the second aim
we will examine how centromere-specific patterns of centromeric cohesion prevent chromosome
missegregation events in cultured cells and in xenograft tumor tissue. The outcome will be fundamental
principles of centromeric array-based cohesion fatigue and resulting patterns of chromosome instability. The
research is innovative because it incorporates the latest information on human centromeric DNA arrays, a new
working model for the organization of centromeric DNA by cohesion, and new quantitative molecular, genomic,
and imaging tools to probe how centromeric cohesion enforces accurate sister chromatid segregation. The
proposed research is significant because centromeric arrays may be unrecognized genetic determinants of
chromosome instability. Many types of cancer are associated with seemingly random patterns of instability that
may have molecular origins in unique centromeric cohesion profiles. Furthermore, many cancers are
associated with mutations that impact chromosome segregation machinery, such as cohesin. The outcome of
this project will be a more complete picture of the mechanisms underlying chromosomal instability."

Our long-term goals are to advance computational protein design to engineer new biological functions and
molecular/cellular engineering strategies to uncover principles of biological regulation. This proposal combines
our two NIGMS grants in these areas.
In our work on computational protein design, we have computationally engineered proteins that sense and
respond to new small molecule signals in cells, a capability with important applications in metabolic engineering,
diagnostics, bioremediation, and probing fundamental cellular processes. We have also advanced methods to
design proteins with precisely tunable shapes entirely de novo. The proposed work builds on our new methods
to address a central unsolved challenge, to simultaneously design the geometries of de novo proteins and user-
defined functional sites placed into them with atomic accuracy optimized for function. This work should greatly
expand the space of new functions that can be designed. We plan to integrate de novo designed proteins into
modular systems that can control biological behavior in response to new signals.
Our work on natural protein functions seeks to understand how central regulatory proteins operate in
interconnected cellular networks, and how these networks are altered upon perturbations such as mutations.
We studied a two-state switch (a GTPase) controlled by opposing regulators because this motif is prevalent in
biology. Through systematic mutagenesis of the GTPase Gsp1 and integrating measurements at the systems
scale (genetic interaction mapping) with biophysics, we uncovered previously unknown allosteric sites on the
GTPase central to its function. Our findings moreover suggest a new model how the pleiotropic GTPase Gsp1
differentially regulates distinct cellular functions. Here we will build on these results to investigate the mechanism
of allostery in Gsp1 and assess its generality in other GTPases, with implications for understanding mechanisms
of disease mutations and for development of modulators. We also plan to test our model of GTPase regulation
by determining quantitative cellular consequences of fine-tuned perturbations to GTPases regulators. Future
directions include expansion of these perturbation measurements to other central biological switches. The
uncovered principles of cellular control can guide cellular engineering, and in conjunction with computationally
designed new functions may ultimately lead to new ways to counteract misregulation in disease."

Exercise is recommended as the first-line intervention for managing chronic pain in people with knee
osteoarthritis (OA). However, activity and exercise related pain in people with knee OA leads to negative
psychological beliefs including catastrophizing and fear avoidance that make exercise and activity challenging.
Avoidance of activity and exercise perpetuates a vicious cycle of further pain. Racial and geographic disparities
in access to exercise are also a reason for poor utilization. Mindfulness-based interventions can address the
negative psychological beliefs in people with chronic pain and when combined with exercise, may address both
physical and psychological impairments. Also, access to care is increasingly being addressed with the use of
telehealth. This project will determine the feasibility of a novel telehealth mindful exercise intervention. Mindful
exercise refers to application of mindfulness to structured exercise and daily physical activity. In this
randomized controlled trial (RCT), participants with knee OA (n=62) will be assigned to a 10-week, group-
based, telehealth - mindful exercise or only exercise arms. The RCT will be decentralized with recruitment,
intervention, and outcome assessment all being conducted using digital tools including social media, electronic
data capture system, and wearable sensors. The first aim is to determine the feasibility of a telehealth mindful
exercise program compared to telehealth exercise in people with knee OA. The second aim is to examine the
feasibility of a decentralized digital study in people with knee OA. The third aim is to examine the variability in
key knee OA related outcomes in both groups to support the design of the future efficacy study. The long-term
goal of this research is to determine the effectiveness of mindful exercise and translate it to clinical practice to
reduce pain and improve function in people with knee OA. This study will provide information on the feasibility
of the proposed intervention in people with knee OA and will also allow for optimization of digital strategies
before conducting larger decentralized trials of intervention efficacy and effectiveness. The intervention is
informed by a preliminary study aligned with Stage 1A of the NIH Stage Model for Development of Behavioral
Interventions. The proposed study reflects Stage 1B before future efficacy and effectiveness studies can be
undertaken. This research could yield a scalable and equitable intervention that is effective at addressing
negative physical and psychological impact of knee OA, a disease that affects 1 in 10 people over the age of
50 in the US."

Our goal in this competitive renewal of our current award is to develop a therapy that targets the placenta directly,
will be effective in later pregnancy following diagnosis of Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR) and investigate
treatment impact on the fetal, and offspring brain and heart. Development of non-viral, biodegradable, targeted
therapeutics for placental insufficiency could significantly impact infant morbidity and mortality and reduce the
risk of fetal programming leading to metabolic disorder and cardiovascular problems in later life. Polymeric
nanoparticles have passed safety regulations and are already being used in human clinical studies as treatments
for cancers. We utilize a biosynthetic co-polymer, complexed with a plasmid containing the Insulin-like Growth
Factor 1 (IGF-1) gene under the control of trophoblast specific promotors and have successfully shown efficient
nanoparticle uptake into human syncytiotrophoblast ex and in vivo using animal models of FGR (surgically-
induced, genetic manipulation, nutrient restricted). In utero placental therapy challenges current paradigms for
the management of FGR and potentially other pregnancy complications which may benefit from improvement of
the in utero environment, such as preterm birth with sterile inflammation. In addition, our studies will provide
more insight into the mechanisms of fetal programming of the brain and cardiovascular system and the impact
of specific, placenta-only intervention of ameliorating the long-term impacts of being born to small.
The use of placentally-targeted therapeutics is highly innovative, challenging current paradigms for the
management of fetal growth restriction and moving gene therapy beyond imaging, targeting, and destruction of
unwanted cells. The proposed research is significant because development of a placental therapeutic allows
manipulation of the in utero environment and ultimately such capabilities and knowledge has the potential to lead
to the development of the first effective treatment for Fetal Growth Restriction. This application is directly
responsive to two of the topics of special emphasis in the recently re-issued ""Notice of Special Interest (NOSI):
High Priority Areas in Placental Research for Healthy Pregnancies"" (Reissue) NOT-HD-22-049 including
elucidation of the molecular mechanisms (e.g., transcriptional regulatory pathways and system biology
approaches), involved in the pathophysiology of placental disorders, and development of targeted therapeutic
strategies to prevent and treat pregnancy complications and/or fetal conditions."

Our long-term goals are to understand intracellular active Ca transport in cardiac muscle and to develop drugs
that target Ca dysregulation in heart failure. We focus on the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca-
ATPase (SERCA2a), the large membrane enzyme that pumps Ca into the SR to relax myocytes after
contraction, and on SERCA’s regulatory proteins (regulins, RLN): phospholamban (PLB), sarcolipin (SLN)
and dwarf open reading frame peptide (DWORF). Ample experimental and clinical data indicates that
activation of muscle Ca transport is a powerful approach to numerous severe and widely spread disorders,
especially heart disease. Over decades, we have developed and used spectroscopic techniques to resolve the
structural mechanism of SERCA regulation by RLN. The challenge is great due to the complexity of the Ca
transport mechanism, which involves dynamic protein-protein interactions, and RLN mechanisms of action are
unclear or controversial. We have recently demonstrated fluorescence lifetime (FLT) methods with exquisite
precision and resolution of protein structural changes, with high-throughput acquisition enabled by rapid
scanning in a microplate reader. In screens of chemical libraries of ≤50,000 small-molecules, we have
identified multiple types of SERCA activators. We are poised to implement early-stage drug discovery
campaigns targeting the SERCA-RLN interaction, to identify compounds with therapeutic potential to treat Ca
dysregulation in heart failure. Our central hypotheses: (1) compounds that shift SERCA-RLN structural state
or binding have tissue-specific effects (2) compounds that enhance Ca-transport enhance myocyte contraction,
and (3) have antiarrhythmic properties. Aim 1 will accelerate discovery of compounds that target SERCA-RLN
interaction. Aim 2 will test effects on SERCA function in cardiac SR, HEK cells expressing human SERCA2a,
and in cardiomyocytes. These novel chemical probes will open new avenues to elucidate structure-function
mechanisms characteristic of SERCA-RLN. Aim 3 will enable lead discovery, using medicinal chemistry to
develop and test analogues of promising Hits from Aim 2. Outcomes of this program will be new lead-like
compounds, and a demonstrated systematic process targeting cardiac Ca-transport for drug discovery and
development. This process will be ready for implementation in large-scale discovery and development
campaigns to be pursued in future academic-industrial partnerships. For impact, we bring together an
innovative combination of techniques, technologies, and experts focused on cardiac Ca transport regulation.
This project is designed to enable future translation, while also developing tools for mechanistic understanding.
SERCA has emerged as a high-value therapeutic target for some of the greatest Public Health challenges, not
only in the heart (heart failure, arrhythmia) but also in skeletal muscle (muscular dystrophy, sarcopenia) and
non-muscle cells (Alzheimer’s, diabetes, obesity, cancer), so the significance of our proposed research
program is great and extends well beyond cardiology.

10881074,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Telomeres, the repetitive DNA at the ends of chromosomes, shorten during every cell division except in very
exceptional circumstances; in particular, rapid telomere elongation in the embryo is essential for ‘resetting’
telomere length. Long telomeres at birth protect genome stability and are associated with good health and
increased longevity, while shorter telomeres are associated with age-related diseases and early mortality. We
have discovered that embryos of obese females exhibit fundamental deficiencies during preimplantation
development that result in offspring having shorter telomeres, providing an explanation for the increased risk of
poor health and early mortality in adult children of obese women. Importantly, we have also determined that
enhancement of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the oocytes of obese mothers restored the capacity for telomere
lengthening during blastocyst formation. This indicates an important but previously unappreciated molecular link
between mitochondria and telomeres and is the first evidence of a regulatory mechanism by which maternal
physiology determines offspring aging and lifespan. The proposed work will define the molecular mechanisms
by which telomeric DNA is extended during preimplantation embryogenesis, including in a clinically relevant
nonhuman primate (NHP) model, establishing completely new concepts around the developmental programming
of healthy aging. We will use cutting-edge micro-manipulation and molecular assessments of genome activation
to determine how oocyte mitochondrial membrane potential is linked to embryo transcriptional reprogramming.
Further, we will identify actionable therapeutic strategies for ensuring the integrity of these developmental
processes in physiological contexts where they are defective. As maternal obesity rates continue to rise,
understanding the impact of diet and obesity on embryo telomere reprogramming has important clinical
ramifications because telomere length at birth is a well-understood determining factor for future disease risk.
Identifying targets and therapeutic approaches to positively manipulate this biology will provide opportunities to
protect essential molecular reprogramming events at conception and during early embryogenesis that ultimately
improve lifetime health."
10882982,"Prostate cancer (PCa) shows a striking degree of clinical variability, with most aging men harboring
indolent, low risk PCa that will not threaten their health during their natural lifetime. Definitive
treatment for these indolent, low risk cancers with surgery or radiation therapy (RT) risks unnecessary
cost and treatment-related toxicity. Because of this, active surveillance (AS), a management strategy
that avoids or defers treatment, has emerged as a standard of care for low risk PCa. AS consists of
monitoring low risk, clinically insignificant PCa patients, with treatment with curative intent ONLY with
progression to clinically significant PCa (csPCa). Determining when a patient progresses on AS
consists a variable mix of serial prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurements, imaging, and prostate
biopsies . However, no consensus exists as to the ideal set of tests and monitoring frequencies
during AS. Prostate biopsy itself has measurable morbidity and is associated with infection, urinary
retention, pain and worsening of urinary symptoms. There is therefore a need for optimization of AS
protocols and to improve the detection of csPCa for men on AS. Prostate imaging with magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) has become an integral tool in the diagnosis of PCa and monitoring of men
on AS as it improves the detection of clinically significant PCa compared to prostate biopsy without
MRI targeting, however accuracy is limited. A negative MRI still misses approximately 20% of csPCa
and a positive MRI will result in a negative biopsy 50% of the time. Better imaging is required to
improve the detection of csPCa. Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission
Tomography-Computed Tomography (PSMA-PET CT) is the most sensitive technique available for
detection of metastatic prostate cancer. The accuracy of PSMA-PET CT in localized disease is
limited; however, it has been shown that PSMA-PET CT adds diagnostic value to prostate MRI for
detection of csPCa, specifically improving negative predictive value. We hypothesize that PSMA-PET
CT in AS patients will improve diagnostic accuracy of prostate MRI such that a negative study will
obviate the need for surveillance prostate biopsy. The Evaluation of Prostate Specific Membrane
Antigen Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography in Active Surveillance for Prostate
CancEr (ESCAPE) trial is a single arm, prospective multi-institutional clinical trial assessing the
negative predictive value of PSMA PET CT in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer. We
hypothesize that PSMA-PET CT can rule out clinically significant prostate in AS patients due to its
high negative predictive value."

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections worldwide and a leading cause of
morbidity and healthcare expenditures across all ages. Older adults and individuals with catheters have a
particularly high risk of UTI sequelae, including kidney infection, permanent renal damage, and urosepsis.
The average mortality rate for urosepsis is 20-40%, but ranges as high as 66% for patients with catheter-
associated UTI (CAUTI). Catheterization also promotes polymicrobial colonization and infection by a wide
range of understudied microbes, including multidrug-resistant organisms that threaten the utility of last-
resort antibiotics, and there is a substantial gap in knowledge regarding the host-microbe interactions that
impact progression from initial colonization to urosepsis. The urothelium is the site of initial host-pathogen
interactions in the urinary tract, a major component of which is the glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-rich glycocalyx
that coats the apical surface of the umbrella cells. The GAG layer protects the urothelium in part by shielding
bacterial surface receptors and contributing to immune surveillance. However, our preliminary data
demonstrate that two of the most common CAUTI pathogens, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis,
encode six putative GAG-degrading enzymes (GAGases). Our initial study of two of these GAGases found
that they facilitate bladder colonization, kidney infection, and urosepsis during experimental infection, and
one allowed P. mirabilis to use GAGs as a carbon source. We hypothesize that the six GAGases facilitate
CAUTI and urosepsis by supporting bacterial growth, urothelial invasion, and immune modulation, and that
differences in GAG composition will influence CAUTI susceptibility and severity. In Aim 1, we will conduct a
comprehensive examination of the GAG composition throughout the urinary tract in mice, a three-
dimensional urine-tolerant human urothelial model, and urine specimens from catheterized patients to
determine the impact of age, sex, and catheterization on composition. In Aim 2, we will define the expression
profile and substrate specificity of all six GAGases, including degradation product size and
immunomodulatory capacity. In Aim 3, we will determine the contribution of GAGases to CAUTI progression
and severity, including polymicrobial infection, as well as the role of GAGs in sex- and age-based differences
in UTI susceptibility and severity. The proposed research will substantially further our understanding of how
catheterization facilitates bacteriuria and urosepsis, and provide insight into a previously unexplored target
for intervention in this patient population."

The program intent is to recruit physicians into a lifelong career in aging research. Our vision is to expand the pipeline of potential physician scientists, who will address the gaps in knowledge that can be translated into treatment for the multiple diseases and disabilities affecting older adults. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Match the incoming UNC-CH MSTAR trainees to carefully selected, outstanding, funded faculty mentors, who will help nurture a growing interest in geriatrics/gerontology research by role modeling. Aim 2. Provide an understanding of the nature of geriatrics/gerontology research, including topics on ethics and responsible conduct of research, delivered by lecture and case presentations. Aim 3. Evaluate yearly the UNC-CH MSTAR program to determine the success of the program, and track outcomes to institute improvements. Aim 4. Select fifteen (12 NIA funded) medical and osteopathic pre-doctoral trainees per year, who will dedicate 2 to 3 summer months to work on an aging-related research project in areas relevant to the NIA mission. Aim 5. Ensure a more diverse group of UNC-CH MSTAR trainees by expanding recruitment efforts. We will recruit 15 pre-doctoral trainees, 12 to be funded by NIA and 3 by UNC-CH. Training will be based in the UNC-CH Center for Aging and Health in collaboration with the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Public Health, Social Work, and the College of Arts and Sciences. Trainees will be chosen from a diverse pool of mostly rising second year medicine and osteopathic students through expanded recruitment efforts. They will be carefully matched with faculty mentors across UNC-CH who conduct funded genetic, biological, clinical, behavioral, social, and economic research related to the aging process, disease and conditions associated with aging, health services and other needs specific to older Americans. Trainees will participate in a mentored research project and attend weekly structured didactic seminars. Faculty mentors and UNC-CH MSTAR leaders will evaluate student performance during the fifth week of training and at the end of the summer experience. Research guidance will be provided by research mentors and UNC-CH MSTAR leaders. Trainees will gain the skills to responsibly conduct research and build an appreciation for the complex issues regarding the scope and impact of aging research through reviews of the relevant literature, development of research initiatives, data analysis, preparation of abstracts and manuscripts, and research presentations. UNC-CH remains fully committed to providing a strong foundation for medical and osteopathic student trainees to build academic careers that advance aging research."

Colon cancer is the 2nd-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and is one of the best-
characterized solid tumors in terms of its common genetic mutations. However, knowledge gaps exist in the
basic understanding of these cancers downstream of their genetic profile. For instance, the tumor-suppressor
gene SMAD4 is mutated in approximately 57% of all colon tumors, and is associated with poor prognosis in
patients, yet there is still little understanding of its molecular mechanisms in colon cancer. Additionally,
while ~70% of colon cancers follow the typical WNT-driven adenoma-to-carcinoma pathway, approximately
20% follow the “serrated tumor pathway”- often driven by gain-of-function BRAF mutations and have the worst
prognosis of colon cancers. The proposal’s main objective will focus on elucidating the mechanistic role of
the tumor suppressor SMAD4 in colon cancers. The hypothesis is that SMAD4 plays a critical transcriptional
regulatory role in regulating the WNT pathway and is a key regulator in the serrated tumor pathway. The
rationale is based on preliminary studies that reveal: 1) that SMAD4 binds to regulatory regions of the genome
also bound by ß-catenin – the transcriptional effector of the most commonly mutated signaling pathway in
colon cancer, the WNT pathway; and 2) SMAD4 loss, when combined with activation of BRAF, can trigger
serrated tumor formation as rapidly as 1 month in mice. Aim 1 will use epigenomic approaches to map the
interaction of SMAD4 with ß-catenin at the level of DNA-binding - detailing the first intersection of these
pathways on the colon cancer genome. Aim 2 will use new mouse models to determine how SMAD4
suppresses the serrated cancer transition from hyperplastic lesions to dysplasias. Aim 3 will use state-of-the-
art tumor organoid model systems to determine how SMAD4 suppresses serrated cancer metastasis. The goal
is to test the hypotheses that 1) SMAD4 directly regulates the WNT-signaling pathway by redirecting ß-catenin
to tumor-suppressive gene targets in coordination with RUNX3, thus impacting cancer development, and 2)
that SMAD4 suppresses key signaling pathways that are required for serrated tumor progression and
metastasis. The proposed studies are significant in that they will identify the regulatory targets of a commonly
mutated tumor-suppressor gene and present a new perspective on an understudied, but more deadly, colon
cancer tumor type. These studies would have broad impacts in the cancer research field, and will reveal new
targets to identify and treat patients with serrated tumors. With the co-mentorship of Drs. Michael Verzi and
Ronald Hart, this proposal's training plan will prepare me for a transition to independence by 1) continuing to
enhance my epigenomics skillset, 2) develop novel model systems to address critical questions in the colon
cancer field, and 3) fortify the skills required to establish and maintain my own independent research program.
The Department of Genetics at Rutgers University has been an outstanding institution for my postdoctoral
training, and I will benefit greatly from the environment as I transition towards independence."

RNA folds into structures that perform fundamental cellular functions including gene regulation, the catalysis of
essential biochemical reactions, and genome defense. In cells, nascent RNA begins to fold when it emerges
from an RNA polymerase during transcription. Consequently, the direction and rate of transcription constrains
the structures that RNA can fold into, and nascent RNA molecules can interact directly with transcribing RNA
polymerases to control their own synthesis. Predicting how changes in the primary sequence of an RNA will
affect its structure and function therefore requires a mechanistic understanding of how RNA folding is
coordinated with transcription. Because all RNAs begin to fold cotranscriptionally, understanding how RNA folds
into functional secondary and tertiary structures will broadly impact our knowledge of RNA biology, the
development of RNA biotechnology, and our ability to identify and address human diseases that are caused by
RNA misfolding. However, probing the basic mechanisms of cotranscriptional RNA structure formation remains
challenging due to the lack of quantitative methods with sufficient throughput to address the complexity of RNA
folding processes. The proposed research will address this challenge by systematically dissecting
cotranscriptional RNA folding mechanisms using new tools that can assess how combinatorial sequence
perturbations affect RNA structure and function. The initial focus of these studies will be to understand how RNA
sequence composition and transcription kinetics coordinate the formation of RNA tertiary structures that enable
ligand-mediated transcription regulation by riboswitches. This work will uncover basic RNA folding principles that
enable accurate and efficient cotranscriptional RNA structure formation, which will advance our ability to both
engineer and characterize RNA systems for biomedical and biotechnological applications. More broadly, these
studies will establish a framework for investigating cotranscriptional RNA structure and function that, in the long
term, will contribute to a predictive understanding of how RNA folds and how sequence mutations can cause
RNA to fold into dysfunctional states."

How does chemical signaling in the brain control function? Answering this question requires fast sensors to
measure at the synapse. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) at carbon-fiber microelectrodes (CFMEs) has
enabled in vivo detection of neuromodulators. However, most sensors are too big to measure at the synapse
and there are challenges to distinguish neurochemicals and monitor multiple neuromodulators simultaneously.
Thus, new sensor technology is needed to target the synapse and measure multiple neuromodulators in real-
time. In the previous period, our lab developed new approaches to electrode development, including testing new
carbon nanomaterials and 3D printing nanolithography. However, these methods have not been customized to
meet the experimental requirements for emerging applications in neurochemical research. The goal of this
project is to develop customized carbon electrodes and tune their properties for applications at the synapse,
including (1) nanoelectrodes for monoamine detection in the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapse,
(2) trapping electrodes for highly sensitive and selective measurements of neuropeptides in Drosophila NMJ,
and (3) a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) platform for multianalyte detection of dopamine and
glutamate simultaneously in vivo and octopamine and glutamate simultaneously in the Drosophila NMJ. This
work is significant because it will transform microelectrode design to facilitate complex measurements
of neurochemistry that will lead to a better understanding of neurochemical signaling at the synapse. In
Aim 1, we will create practical nanoelectrodes for measurements in smaller organisms by coating etched metal
wires with carbon nanospikes and 3D printing long nanofibers through shrinkage-induced pulling. These small,
less than 200-500 nm nanoelectrodes will be used to measure octopamine in the Drosophila NMJ synapse. In
Aim 2, we will design electrodes with trapping effects to improve sensitivity and selectivity. These carbon
nanotube (CNT) yarn electrodes and 3D printed electrodes with arrays of carbon pillars will be used to measure
neuropeptides in the Drosophila NMJ. In Aim 3, we will develop a Si-based platform for biosensors and direct
electrochemistry, enabling multianalyte measurements. The Si-cantilever microneedle will be implantable in vivo
and in Drosophila NMJ for simultaneous measurements of neurotransmitters. The proposed research is
innovative because it uses new technology to radically change electrode fabrication and enable novel electrode
designs. This work will demonstrate proof of principle that these electrodes are capable of measuring many
neuromodulators in a model synapse Drosophila NMJ as well as in vivo. With a focus on easy, batch fabrication,
these electrodes will be made available to the neuroscience community, to facilitate studies of real-time
neuromodulation and how it malfunctions during disease."

HIV associated neurological disorder (HAND), a major comorbidity affecting about 30-50% of patients receiving
suppressive anti-retroviral therapy is characterized by difficulties with attention, concentration, decision making
and memory, depression and slowed movements. Although chronic activation of brain microglia is proposed to
drive HAND, the molecular mechanisms remain ill defined. Emerging evidence has shown that epigenetic
mechanisms involving aberrant DNA methylation may significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple
sclerosis, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. Nevertheless, the role of DNA methylation specifically in HIV
induced monocyte/microglia activation remains unknown. The fact that epigenetic marks are heritable and
passed on to several generations of daughter cells during mitosis might explain a potential mechanism causing
monocyte/microglial activation that may in turn help maintain persistent neuroinflammation in cART treated
patients. Our preliminary studies identified significant upregulation of proinflammatory interferon stimulated and
chemokine genes in basal ganglia and marked alterations in DNA methylation of CpG islands in promoters of
genes associated with inflammatory response, apoptosis, dsDNA damage response and oxidative stress in
colonic epithelium of chronically SIV-infected macaques, respectively. More importantly, chronic cannabinoid
treatment to ART naïve SIV-infected rhesus macaques prevented proinflammatory gene expression in brain and
epigenetic alterations suggesting their immense therapeutic potential for attenuating neuroinflammation and
reduced HAND related symptoms. In the proposed studies, we will for the first time investigate changes in DNA
methylation associated with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol, JWH133 (CB2R agonist) induced
suppression of monocyte/microglial activation through the course of SIV infection. Further, we will determine the
effect of combination anti-retroviral treatment (cART) in conjunction with chronic cannabinoid treatments on
epigenetic alterations, viral reservoir, inflammation and endogenous cannabinoid levels in the blood and
cerebrospinal fluid. Finally, we will investigate the receptor mediated and molecular mechanisms by which THC
blocks endoplasmic reticulum stress, a key event in the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. The proposed
research is highly innovative and applies state of the art immunological and molecular approaches to fill a
significant gap in our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms associated with HAND. As cannabinoids have
shown great promise for the treatment of neurological disorders, the proposed studies are necessary, as it will
provide a fundamental understanding of the epigenetic and endocannabinoid mechanisms underlying their anti-
inflammatory effects. Finally, the results will have important therapeutic implications for immune modulation in
not only HIV but also other chronic neuroinflammatory diseases."

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron loss
and skeletal muscle atrophy. SMA is caused by reduced levels of the SMN protein due to homozygous mutations
in the SMN1 gene and is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. Studies in mouse models revealed that
SMA pathology involves dysfunction of sensory-motor circuits comprising multiple neuron types and possibly
non-neuronal cells. Beyond motor neuron death, dysfunction and loss of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) as
well as central synapses from proprioceptive sensory neurons are established early drivers of motor system
pathology in SMA. Mechanistically, the SMN protein functions in the assembly of small nuclear
ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) that mediate pre-mRNA splicing and 3’-end processing of histone mRNAs; and our
previous studies directly linked dysregulation of these RNA pathways to SMA pathology. Importantly, three
different SMN-inducing therapies have been approved for SMA treatment which prevent early death and slow
progression depending on disease severity and time of intervention. However, these therapies alone do not
provide a cure and significant motor deficits persist in SMA patients, especially those treated late. Therefore,
incomplete correction of disease symptoms combined with variability in the clinical response to treatment
represent urgent unmet needs of SMA patients. In this context, it remains essential to further our understanding
of SMA disease mechanisms as a means to identify novel therapeutic targets and to develop new
pharmacological approaches that can enhance the clinical benefit of SMN-inducing drugs through combinatorial
treatment. Here, we propose a multidisciplinary research project that addresses these outstanding issues by
building on published studies and preliminary data gathered during the previous award period. In Aim 1, we will
establish the conservation of RNA-mediated mechanisms of synaptic pathology across mouse models of SMA
with varying disease severity as a necessary step to determine their relevance to the human disease. We will
employ validated means for selective restoration of individual RNA pathways and downstream targets of SMN
deficiency by AAV9-mediated gene delivery to link the loss of proprioceptive synapses and NMJ denervation,
respectively, to disruption of U12 splicing and U7-mediated histone mRNA processing in both severe and milder
models of SMA. In Aim 2, guided by our hypothesis that dysregulation of the glutamatergic system contributes
to SMA pathology, we will determine the therapeutic potential of a novel disease-modifying pharmacological
approach aimed at stimulating glutamatergic neurotransmission and improving sensory-motor circuit activity in
mouse models of SMA. This will be tested either alone or together with SMN-inducing drugs to highlight
synergistic effects relevant for combinatorial treatment of SMA. In Aim 3, we will investigate intrinsic activation
of the innate immune response in microglia as a novel RNA-mediated, non-cell autonomous mechanism of
sensory-motor circuit pathology and a candidate therapeutic target in SMA."
10882795,"PROJECT SUMMARY
It has been shown that variation in cancer risk is influenced by mutations that may be inherited,
caused by environmental factors such as smoking and ultraviolet exposure, or resulting from
random DNA replication errors. Here we propose a novel factor in cancer risk, which is related to
the genetic diversity of the immune system across humans and its ability to detect and eliminate
early cancers. Immunosurveillance is the concept that the immune system acts as a surveillance
system to detect and destroy neoplastic cells before they progress to a detectable malignant
cancer. This process relies on T cells, which recognize tumor mutation-derived neoantigens
presented by the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules on the cell surface, resulting in tumor-
killing. While HLA genes are among the most polymorphic genes in vertebrates, including
humans, and are associated with several infectious diseases and can also increase the risk for
autoimmunity, our preliminary analysis suggests HLA diversity influences cancer risk. The goal of
this proposed research is to study the contribution of immunogenetics on the efficiency of tumor
immune surveillance and its ultimate effect on cancer risk. Our preliminary analysis demonstrates
an association between HLA homozygosity and increased risk of cancer in lung cancer. Using
large prospective cohorts of individuals with deep genetic and phenotypic data, we will investigate
the relationship of HLA diversity and lung and melanoma cancer risk and the interaction of HLA
immunogenetics with environmental risk factors. A murine carcinogen induced lung cancer model
will offer validation of causality as well as mechanistic insights for therapeutic targets. The insights
gained from these studies will potentially improve predictive cancer risk models in germline
carriers and suggest strategies for immune-mediated cancer prevention."
10883474,"Project Summary/Abstract
The degree of behavioral control that an organism (rodent to human) can exert over an adverse event is
arguably the most potent variable yet discovered that modulates the impact of that event. When the organism
does have an element of control, the behavioral and neurochemical sequelae of the adverse event are blunted
or eliminated. Importantly, the experience of control not only blunts the impact of the stressor being controlled,
but also blunts the impact of stressors experienced much later, that is, control produces future resilience in the
face of adversity. Research over the past grant period has indicated that control does so by activating distinct
circuits within the prelimbic (PL) region of the medial prefrontal cortex that process separable features of
control. One, a corticostriatal circuit that detects the contingency between the instrumental controlling response
(action) and stressor termination (outcome) and another, a prefrontal-to-brainstem projection, that
subsequently uses control information to inhibit stress-responsive structures, thereby blunting the impact of the
stressor. Data also suggest a potential role for the mediodorsal thalamus (MDT) in detecting control and
serving as a substrate for communication between the above circuits. Moreover, we have found that the
experiences of behavioral control and social dominance engage similar PL circuitry in producing resilience to
future nonsocial stressors. Thus, the present proposal focuses on the mechanisms by which behavioral control
(Aim 1) and social dominance (Aim II) produce resilience/resistance against future stressors. Finally, the
protective effects of behavioral control and winning are completely absent in females and Aim III seeks to
determine exactly how PL circuitry may respond differently between the sexes."

The goal of this project is to test whether a multi-level, community-engaged intervention to build a sustainable 
food economy with food-is-medicine programs in the Mississippi Delta can improve minority health and reduce 
health disparities. Our central hypothesis is that an intervention developed with active community engagement 
to increase local production and distribution of fruits and vegetables (FV), will increase FV consumption and 
decrease body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and health disparities among participating adults 
compared to control participants over a 12-month study period. 
Aim 1: To design a novel intervention that bolsters the local food economy and delivers food-is-medicine 
programming to a minority population within communities with persistent disadvantage. Using the 
principles and processes of community-engaged research, we will unite community partners and members of 
Bolivar, Washington, and Sunflower Counties in a local multi-sector Delta Food Policy Council (FPC). The FPC 
will design and implement a multi-level intervention to provide appropriate nutrition, focusing on locally grown 
FV, to build a sustainable food economy and improve health outcomes. 
Aim 2: To test whether the novel intervention reduces health disparities by improving outcomes related 
to obesity and diabetes among a rural minority population. We will work collaboratively with the FPC to 
implement and evaluate a multi-level, community-engaged, randomized controlled intervention targeting 300 
adults (>25 y) with food insecurity, BMI >25, and HbA1c)>5.7-8.5%. Outcome measures are (*primary): 
Individual-level: increase F+V consumption*; decrease obesity (BMI)*, diabetes risk (HbA1c)*, and systolic 
blood pressure 
Community-level: increase production and distribution of FV; institute access to produce and decrease food 
insecurity; and decrease health care utilization 
Aim 3: Generate a replicable and scalable food economy model to reduce obesity and improve diabetes. 
The model will focus on adults living in areas with disadvantage and make sustainable food-is-medicine policy 
recommendations related to SNAP, Medicare/Medicaid and the Farm Bill to state and federal legislatures. 
Expected impact: Community-centered efforts that build vital local food economies to support food-is-medicine 
programming represent a major innovation that integrates nutrition into the healthcare system and social safety 
net to ameliorate disease, mitigate disparities, and save billions of dollars in health care expenditures annually."

Exercise induces a wider-range of physiological responses, such as the changes in skeletal muscle, hepatic
glucose metabolism and intermediary metabolism. These responses involve a coordinated multi-organ
crosstalk between the brain, liver and skeletal muscle. A region in the brain knowns as the ventromedial
hypothalamus (VMH) plays a critical role in the regulation of metabolism and the metabolic responses to
exercise .The VMH is thought to act primarily through the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the release
of catelcholamines, which then bind to adrenergic receptors in target tissues. We hypothesize that the VMH
mediates some of the metabolic benefits of exercise via the β2AR isoform in skeletal muscle, and the α1bAR
isoform in liver. The goal of this application is to investigate the contributions of these tissue-specific isoforms
to the metabolic benefits of exercise using novel genetically engineered mice and novel metabolic flux analysis
methods. We anticipate that the results from our investigation will provide novel insights into potential therapies
to combat metabolic disease."

Prescription opioids have been a key driver of the US opioid crisis, resulting in nearly 500,000 overdose deaths
from 1999 to 2019. The US has the highest rate of per capita opioid consumption in the world. Prior to class
action lawsuits beginning in 2014, prescription opioids such as oxycodone were marketed by their producers
as safe and non-addictive, resulting in a peak dispensing rate of 81.3 prescriptions per 100 Americans in 2012.
As a result of these lawsuits there has been an unprecedented release of internal industry documents detailing
prescription opioid manufacturers’ efforts to promote their products as safe and non-addictive to consumers,
health care providers, and US regulators. We propose the first systematic analysis using the UCSF Opioids
Industry Documents Archive (OIDA) of over 3.1 million documents that were obtained through the discovery
process in litigation from pharmaceutical companies, trade associations, and government agencies (e.g.,
private correspondence by company executives, advertising firms, lobbying reports, corporate strategic plans,
undisclosed company research). Expanding on industry documents analysis pioneered in research on tobacco,
the proposed study will use novel new methods, including artificial intelligence guided search strategies, to
assess how opioid manufacturers successfully marketed prescription opioids to patients, health care providers,
and regulators, resulting in prescribing rates and consumption beyond medically warranted levels. There is
limited evidence on how pharmaceutical companies established false claims that opioids were not addictive or
harmful. Existing studies suggest a wide range of possibilities: aggressive marketing, industry interference in
scientific research on opioid safety, weak state regulations, and exploitation of stigmatizing assumptions about
addiction. We hypothesize that activities involved in marketing prescription opioids could be another
commercial determinant of health, and our analysis will assess strategies used by opioid manufacturers to
influence the behaviors of three key constituencies that resulted in increased consumption of prescription
opioids. This knowledge will inform future regulatory actions on addictive pharmaceuticals that could be
marketed as therapeutic, including cannabis, benzodiazepines, MDMA, and methamphetamines. Specific aims
are: 1) Identify strategies used to market opioids directly to patients; 2) Assess pharmaceutical industry
messages and marketing strategies directed at opioid prescribers and dispensers; and 3) Evaluate
pharmaceutical industry outreach and advocacy to state and federal regulators. This unique scientific
contribution, which focuses on the role of activities to market addictive prescription medications as commercial
determinants of health, will inform federal and state policies on prescription drug advertising and prescribing,
and clinician guidelines and ethical standards on prescriber engagement with pharmaceutical companies."

Obesity has been a persistent public health issue for decades. People with obesity experience higher risk of
chronic diseases, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke.
Approximately 42% of adults in the United States (US) currently have obesity, with a disproportionately high
prevalence among Black Americans. Yet, we still have an inadequate understanding of the etiology of obesity
and the drivers of obesity disparities. Discrimination has been implicated as an obesogenic risk factor.
Discrimination is understood as a multidimensional construct that operate at multiple levels and in different
social contexts. Yet, the association between multiple forms of discrimination and adiposity is not well
understood. It also remains understudied the cellular-level processes for how discrimination “gets under the
skin” to produce physiological dysregulation. Defining the relationship between multiple forms of discrimination
and adiposity and molecular markers of inflammation will provide the foundation for increasing the efficacy of
prevention efforts and treatment to reduce obesity and Black-White obesity disparities. Using the data from
three large, population-based cohort studies—the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health,
Midlife in the United States, and Health and Retirement Study—we will first assess the associations between
multiple forms of discrimination (i.e., neighborhood and interpersonal) with adiposity markers (i.e., body mass
index and waist circumference). We will then assess the association between multiple forms of discrimination
with downstream changes in cellular gene expression of inflammation, identify cellular and molecular
mechanisms involved, and quantify the extent to gene expression mediate the relationship between
discrimination and adiposity. We will also quantify the extent to which discrimination explain racial disparities in
adiposity and gene expression. Lastly, we will evaluate the moderating effect of social integration on the
associations between discrimination and adiposity and gene expression. The project will lay the groundwork for
future studies to assess the association between discrimination and other age-related outcomes and inform
interventions that can be developed to reduce disparities in health."

The immune response to Toxoplasma gondii, a prevalent foodborne pathogen, relies heavily on the cytokine
IFN-γ. Previous research has primarily focused on the role of dendritic cells and macrophages in triggering IFN-
γ responses. However, the contribution of non-myeloid cells, particularly intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), in IFN-
γ-mediated host defense remains poorly understood. Our preliminary data suggest that IECs play a central role
in inducing intestinal immunopathology during T. gondii infection, characterized by tissue damage without a
significant increase in parasite burden. We have also identified a novel mTOR-dependent mechanism of Paneth
cell death, a subset of IECs, in IFN-γ-induced immunopathological responses. However, the responses of other
IECs to IFN-γ are largely unknown. In this competitive renewal, our goal is to gain a mechanistic understanding
of IEC-specific IFN-γ-mediated immunity to T. gondii by investigating both protective and immunopathological
responses. We have two specific aims: Aim 1: Determine intestinal epithelial cell-specific responses to IFN-γ
during T. gondii infection. In this aim, we aim to identify the specific IECs that mediate IFN-γ-dependent
immunopathology triggered by T. gondii infection and define the lineage-specific responses of IECs to IFN-γ
during mucosal infection. Aim 2: Identify the IFN-γ-induced metabolic adaptations of epithelial cells contributing
to the pathological response during T. gondii infection. Building upon our previous findings of mTOR inactivation
and Paneth cell death, we will investigate the metabolic changes in IECs triggered by IFN-γ. By the completion
of this aim, we will have a comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying
IFN-γ-mediated intestinal pathology during T. gondii infection.
The proposed project is significant and innovative due to its novel concept of IFN-mediated immunity and
immunopathology at the site of infection, and the experimental tools developed to accomplish the goal of this
proposal during the previous funding period."
10876337,"SUMMARY
The standard view of how we make sense of the world around us focuses on reconstructing our environment
from the information received by our sensory organs. In this view, low-level brain areas (e.g., primary sensory
cortex) represent basic features of objects, which are elaborated on in successive processing stages, until
representations become increasingly complex in high-level areas (e.g., frontal cortex). An alternative view is
predictive coding (PC), in which we model our environment to generate sensory predictions. In PC, high-level
brain areas generate predictions of sensory activity and transmit them to low-level areas. A prediction that
does not match the sensory information gives rise to a prediction error. This error signal is sent from low- to
high-level brain areas to update the model of our environment, thereby improving future predictions to minimize
errors. Modeling studies show PC is a fast and efficient way to process sensory information, and PC provides
innovative hypotheses for understanding sleep and anesthesia, particularly when disconnected consciousness
occurs (consciousness without awareness of the environment), like dreaming. PC also holds great promise for
conceptualizing and treating brain disorders, including schizophrenia and depression. But key central features
of PC have not been empirically tested and little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms. The goal
of the proposed project is to characterize the neural dynamics, circuits and receptors enabling PC. There are
two principle hypotheses. First, predictions depend on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) because
NMDAR influence the activity of high-level brain areas where predictions are generated, and NMDAR are
enriched on neurons in lower-level areas receiving predictions. Second, in disconnected consciousness, a
breakdown of information transmission from low-level to high-level brain areas, as well as a breakdown of
computations within each area, explains why models of our environment are not updated by external sensory
information. These breakdowns prevent the comparison of predictions and sensory information, as well as the
transmission of prediction errors to high-level brain areas. To test these hypotheses, we use a cross-species
experimental design connecting cellular, circuit and systems levels to behavior. We will perform
electroencephalography, machine learning and computational modeling to define the neural basis of PC in
humans performing prediction tasks. Then we will manipulate PC using different anesthetic agents with diverse
mechanisms, establishing causal relationships between receptors, large-scale brain networks and PC. In
parallel, we will simultaneously record activity from sensory and high-level brain areas of non-human primates
(NHPs) using the same PC tasks and pharmacological interventions to measure cellular and circuit level
contributions to PC. Investigating PC will illuminate the fundamental mechanisms of perception, providing
critical insights to guide therapeutic development for multiple health conditions."

With 36 million people currently living with HIV worldwide and no vaccine currently available, developing a pre-
exposure prophylactic (PREP) HIV regimen that protects against sexual transmission remains a top global health
priority. Recently, a CCR5 blocking monoclonal antibody, Leronlimab, has shown exceptional safety, tolerability,
and anti-HIV activity in multiple clinical trials. Given that sexual transmission of HIV is almost exclusively
mediated by CCR5-tropic variants, Leronlimab may be extremely effective as a PREP reagent. We confirmed
the ability of once-weekly administered Leronlimab to protect macaques from rectal transmission of CCR5-tropic
SHIV. However, a once-quarterly at home formulation would dramatically increase patient adherence. To this
end we will develop a novel formulation of long-acting Leronlimab that can be administered at home in a low
volume able to provide coverage for three months. In specific aim 1, we will determine the pK and receptor
occupancy of this new Leronlimab formulation in blood and tissue sites of sexual transmission. In specific aim 2,
we will determine the length of time a single injection at the clinical dose can protect both male and female
macaques against rectal transmission. In specific aim 3, we will determine the length of time a single injection of
the clinical dose can protect against vaginal transmission in cycling female macaques. These studies will
determine the optimal clinical dosing of long-acting Leronlimab and lay the foundation for testing long-acting
Leronlimab clinically as PREP in individuals at high-risk of acquiring HIV via sexual transmission."

Cerebral edema is a major contributor to neurological deterioration and the leading cause of in-hospital death
after stroke. This pathologic water accumulation results in an increase in brain volume that can be measured
after most hemispheric strokes. This brain swelling not only raises the risk of cerebral herniation but also impairs
stroke recovery as much as infarct growth does. However, the key biologic factors and molecular mechanisms
that mediate formation of cerebral edema remain poorly defined. This knowledge gap has hindered development
of targeted interventions to mitigate the consequences of edema in conditions as diverse as brain trauma,
tumors, and hemorrhagic as well as ischemic strokes. There is significant variability between patients, with some
exhibiting malignant edema and others with none to mild swelling despite similar stroke sizes and severities. The
central objective of this proposal is to integrate imaging with genetics to identify key biologic pathways and
mediators implicated in cerebral edema. We will acquire serial CT scans from 3,506 patients in an NINDS-funded
stroke genetics study (GENISIS) and 1,000 being enrolled in an ERA-NET NEURON-funded study (iBioStroke).
We will apply automated analysis pipelines to obtain quantitative multi-dimensional measurements of edema
severity. Our primary biomarker is the displacement of cerebrospinal fluid (ΔCSF) that serves as a surrogate for
the volume of swelling that has developed after stroke. However, we will also measure hemispheric CSF ratio
and lesional water uptake as additional edema phenotypes. We will model edema formation (in relation to time
from stroke onset) to evaluate the degree to which biologic factors, such as age, sex, glucose, blood pressure,
and renal function, influence edema formation. Our central hypothesis is that inter-patient variability in edema
formation can be linked to both targetable clinical factors such as hyperglycemia and informative genetic
differences. Our preliminary data has suggested that ΔCSF has a significant heritable component. Specific Aim
1 seeks to quantify the relationship of key clinical factors, such as hyperglycemia and blood pressure, to edema
formation. We will leverage genomic data to further dissect which factors are causative in edema formation,
using Mendelian randomization. We will also quantify the impact of edema and hemorrhagic transformation on
stroke recovery. Specific Aim 2 will identify genes and pathways associated with cerebral edema after stroke. It
will employ genome-wide association (GWAS) approaches with multiple edema phenotypes in this large cohort.
We will further prioritize genes and pathways using functional annotation tools. Specific Aim 3 will dissect shared
versus edema-specific injury mechanisms by analyzing edema in relation to traits such as hemorrhagic
transformation, white matter injury and small-vessel disease. It will leverage large existing datasets to boost the
power of gene discovery from Aim 2. Once complete, this work will provide the first comprehensive picture of
the genetic architecture of cerebral edema after stroke and provide unbiased, novel insights into molecular
targets that can inform drug discovery."

This application investigates the relationship between mitochondrial apoptotic stress,
senescence and aging. Cellular senescence is a well-established driver of tissue and
organismal aging, a process thought to be partly mediated via the induction of a chronic
Senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Consequently, there is great interest in
selectively targeting senescent cells as a strategy to promote healthy aging. Our work has
demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of cellular senescence and a driver of
the SASP. Mitochondria are also major regulators of apoptosis, a process which involves
mitochondrial outer membrane permeability (MOMP) and subsequent release of cytochrome c
through the actions of the pro-apoptotic proteins BAX and BAK. We found that MOMP occurring
in a small subset of mitochondria without inducing cell-death, a process known as minority
MOMP (miMOMP) is a feature of cellular senescence and contributes to the SASP. We have
also observed that miMOMP leads to the release of cytosolic mtDNA which can engage the
cGAS/STING pathway, a major regulator of the SASP. These data led us to hypothesize that
miMOMP is a major contributor to the senescent phenotype and may be a novel target for
interventions aiming to counteract aging and age-related pathology.
We will conduct in vitro experiments in which we will explore the molecular mechanisms of why
miMOMP occurs during senescence and how it impacts on senescence and the SASP (aims 1
and 2). Finally, we will investigate the impact of genetic and pharmacologic interventions which
alleviate miMOMP during aging in vivo (aim 3). For that, we will unravel the relative impact of
conditional deletion of BAX/BAK (which drive miMOMP) and/or Apaf1 (essential for MOMP-
dependent caspase activation) during aging in vivo. Finally, we will test the effectiveness of
miMOMP-inhibiting drugs on improving key phenotypes in aging mice.
Our ultimate goal is to identify new interventions that target senescent cells to alleviate age-
related dysfunction."

The presence of aneuploidy (chromosomal abnormalities) in embryos is considered one of the major limitations
to successful human reproduction and a significant cause of gestation failure, accounting for approximately 50%
of early miscarriages. Aneuploidy rates are strikingly high in in vitro fertilized human embryos, and around 60%
of these embryos are mosaic, containing both aneuploid and normal euploid cells. The frequent occurrence of
mosaicism exists in both naturally conceived and IVF pregnancies. However, despite the high incidence of
aneuploidy in human embryos, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms and developmental fate of these
cells is restricted due to the considerable ethical limitations associated with human embryo and fetal research.
My previous work demonstrated lineage-specific behavior of aneuploidy in early differentiation using an in vitro
human embryonic stem cell (hESC) model. To further characterize the cellular physiology of aneuploidy after
implantation, an in vivo animal model is required. Common marmosets exhibit naturally occurring aneuploidy,
making them a more representative model for humans than rodents are. Therefore, I propose a marmoset model
to further dissect aneuploidy cell fate and its molecular and cellular consequences during early development. My
preliminary data uncovered that aneuploid marmoset embryonic stem cells (cj-ESCs) preferentially differentiate
into trophectoderm lineages in response to BMP4 stimulation, similar to the behavior I observed with hESCs in
my previous work, suggesting a conserved role of aneuploidy in restricting stem cells to extraembryonic fates.
During the training period, I will use a unique marmoset stem cell model (gastruloid) that recapitulates early
lineage specification and gastrulation to investigate the role of BMP4 signaling in the phenotypic manifestation
of aneuploidy (Aim 1). To further investigate the elimination and allocation of aneuploidy, I will construct mosaic
marmoset embryos to probe aneuploidy cell fate and behaviors during pre-and post-implantation embryonic
development in vitro (Aim 2). Since my preliminary data indicates a higher tolerance of aneuploidy in the
extraembryonic lineages, during the independent phase of the award period, I propose to analyze the gene
expression profile of aneuploidy in the marmoset placenta to understand the effects of aneuploidy on the cellular
physiology of extraembryonic tissue. In addition, during this phase, I will construct a placental/trophoblast
organoid from cj-ESCs to further dissect the behaviors of aneuploidy in different placental lineages (Aim 3).
Together, the proposed research will present a comprehensive model for studying a previously uncharacterized
mechanism underlying the elimination of aneuploidy during embryogenesis, paving the way for translational
applications to assisted reproductive technologies. The proposed project will also serve as a platform for me to
obtain training and scientific expertise in molecular and developmental biology, animal reproductive sciences,
and computational genomics which will contribute significantly to my career development as an independent
investigator in the field of reproductive biology."

Our research is focused on fundamental questions related to cell polarity. Cell polarity describes the ability
of cells to spatially organize their internal constituents along a specific axis. It is critical for cell migration
(where cells need to generate a front and a back), and also for developing specialized cell shapes that are
needed for many cells to function. In addition, derangements of the polarity machinery can contribute to
several diseases, for example by enabling cancer metastases. Thus, an understanding of the mechanisms,
regulation, and consequences of cell polarity is of both fundamental and medical interest.
Studies on cell polarity have identified an evolutionarily ancient and conserved core machinery centered on
a primary regulator of polarity called Cdc42. However, many of the most interesting questions remain
unsolved. How is it that most cells only make a single “front” enriched in Cdc42, but some cells with more
complex shapes can specify several sites to act as fronts? How do cells read their environment to
determine the direction in which they should orient the polarity axis? Once polarity is established, how is the
precise downstream set of events orchestrated to give each cell type the right shape? And then, how do
cells know what shape they are?
We use the uniquely tractable yeast model system to investigate these questions, and apply a combination
of cutting-edge microscopy, genetics, and computational modeling. Our previous work identified a positive
feedback mechanism that explains how Cdc42 becomes concentrated at polarity sites to establish a polarity
axis. Our recent work on polarization during yeast mating, when yeast cells orient in response to spatial
gradients of pheromones, suggests a new paradigm, called Exploratory Polarization, for tracking chemical
gradients. And new findings on marine fungi reveal novel lifestyles whose cell biology has yet to be
characterized. For the next 5-year grant cycle, our major goals are to (i) address how cell polarity is
regulated by cell cycle and pheromone signaling; (ii) address remaining open questions about the new
exploratory polarization mechanism that enables mating cells to find each other, and (iii) to understand how
marine fungi that make several buds in each cell cycle can partition their nuclei and organelles among the
different buds. We are poised to make significant advances on the questions posed above, and to exploit
the answers to those questions to provide insights that extend well beyond the yeast system."

This project will address the critical need for accelerated development of multidrug regimen to achieve fast and
complete clearance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), thereby lowering the likelihood for the emergence of
antimicrobial resistance. Mtb dynamically adapts to extra- and intracellular host environments by adopting
heterogeneous physiologic states, with varied susceptibility profiles to frontline antitubercular drugs. In the first
four years of the R01, we have made progress towards dissecting this capability of Mtb by developing
technologies to (i) uncover regulatory mechanisms that drive the pathogen into dormant states in host-simulated
environments (controlled bioreactors) and directly within host cells (Path-seq), (ii) sort and characterize at single
cell resolution translationally-dormant persister-like subpopulations within isogenic cultures (PerSort), (iii)
uncover and characterize context-specific vulnerabilities within regulatory and metabolic networks (EGRIN2 and
PRIME), and (iv) rationally formulate novel synergistic drug combinations (DRonA and MLSynergy). Using these
capabilities and their applications reported across sixteen publications, we discovered that heterogeneous drug
tolerant subpopulations co-exist within an isogenic culture of Mtb, even in the absence of drug treatment.
Furthermore, we discovered that stressful environments and treatments activate additional drug tolerance
networks, which may potentiate the emergence of resistance. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that we
can achieve fast and complete clearance of Mtb infection with a combination of drugs that target vulnerabilities
across heterogeneous drug tolerant subpopulations that co-exist in varied combinations and proportions
depending on host- and treatment-contexts. To test this hypothesis, we will mechanistically characterize how the
heterogeneous population structure of Mtb changes dynamically in response to host-relevant environmental cues
and drug treatments. We will then uncover and characterize vulnerabilities within regulatory and metabolic
networks that support and drive transitions to drug tolerant states. Using machine-learning techniques, we will
predict and validate synergistic drug combinations targeting multiple vulnerabilities to cripple heterogeneous
environment- and drug-induced states of Mtb. By performing time kill curves, we will investigate whether
validated combinatorial interventions accomplish complete and faster clearance of heterogeneous Mtb
subpopulations in diverse contexts. Altogether, the proposed activities will identify novel drug targets, and novel
drug combinations for fast and complete clearance of a heterogeneous Mtb population. Given that phenotypic
heterogeneity as a means for tolerating and resisting drugs is a universal phenomenon, the systems biology
framework developed in this project will be generalizable to the discovery of effective multidrug regimen for
diverse infectious diseases and even cancers."

South Africa remains one of the countries mostly heavily impacted by the HIV epidemic, with an overall
estimated adult HIV prevalence of 18% to 30% among female antenatal clinic attendees. There is now
substantial evidence that more than 80% of new infections occur within primary male-female partnerships.
The high rates of new infections among primary partnerships are attributed to a combination of low levels of
HIV testing and a high prevalence of outside sex partners. Recent work by Darbes (MPI), in KwaZulu-Natal
(KZN) – the site of the proposed new research – found that among a sample of 330 heterosexual couples, 49%
of men and 41% of women had no previous HIV testing history. In 20% of couples, neither partner had ever
tested for HIV, despite living in a region with one of the highest adult HIV prevalence globally. Beyond the low
levels of HIV testing, recent work also demonstrates significant deficits across the continuum of care in South
Africa: recent work by Haber in KZN shows that only 45% of HIV-positive individuals are linked to care, 35%
initiate ART, and 33% reach viral suppression. There is increasing evidence of efficacy for couples' focused HIV
prevention interventions. Couples HIV Testing and Counseling (CHTC) is a proven strategy to reduce the risk
of HIV transmission between partners. However, CHTC focuses only on the first stage of the cascade of HIV
care – testing – are there are no interventions that allow couples to pass through the cascade of care together.
Using a randomized controlled trial design with 272 couples, we aim to address this gap in HIV prevention and
care literature by comparing a package of dyadic focused HIV testing and counseling interventions, against an
attention matched control. The proposed RCT will test the efficacy of the dyadic intervention for achieving
gains in viral suppression and engagement in HIV care. Heterosexual couples represent a significant yet over-
looked risk group in South Africa, and innovative solutions are urgently needed to improve progression across
the continuum of HIV care."

The overarching goal of the proposed research is to realize the immune system's potential for breast cancer
prevention in BRCA mutation carriers. Immunotherapeutic agents have proven effective in treating metastatic
cancers by reinvigorating the antitumor immune responses that develop during cancer progression and
metastasis. In contrast, our research focuses on cancer immunoprevention and aims to identify the immune
pathways that can prevent breast cancer formation in normal breast glands and block pre-cancerous lesions
from advancing to invasive disease in BRCA mutation carriers. This approach raises a unique opportunity to
discover novel immune mechanisms that can be leveraged for breast cancer prevention and therapy in this high-
risk population. With the ultimate goal of early interception that will eliminate the risk of metastatic disease, we
will investigate the underlying mechanisms of immune cell activation that we have discovered in the BRCA
mutant breast glands. We will (1) determine the breast gland-derived immune factors that induce the immune
response in BRCA mutant breast glands, (2) examine the characteristics of the immune cells infiltrating BRCA
mutation breast glands, (3) investigate the impact of the immune cells in BRCA mutant breast glands on cancer
development, and (4) identify novel interventions that can potentiate antitumor functionality of immune cells in
BRCA mutant breast glands. Importantly, we will leverage our optimized animal models to elucidate critical
immune pathways regulating BRCA mutant breast glands that are difficult to discern in human tissues due to
inter-patient heterogeneity. Ultimately, the proposed research aims to establish the foundation for breast cancer
immunoprevention, benefiting patients at high risk of breast cancer development and recurrence."

Neuromodulatory GPCRs are critical regulators of neuronal activity that function within complex networks of
accessory proteins which shape their signaling across space and time. Proteins in the potassium channel
tetramerization domain (KCTD) family are important accessory subunits of the GABAB receptor, serving to
regulate the intensity and duration of signaling in response to the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. However,
a mechanistic understanding of KCTD regulation of GABAB receptors is lacking and whether KCTDs regulate
other neuromodulatory GPCRs is unknown. In aim 1, we will investigate GABAB receptor/KCTD coupling at the
molecular level, using a combination of structural studies by cryo-electron microscopy and biophysical analysis
in vitro. In aim 2, we will probe the cellular mechanisms of KCTD regulation of GABAB receptor signaling with
functional studies by electrophysiology and fluorescence microscopy and proximity labeling mass spectrometry
both in cell lines and primary neurons. In aim 3, we will build on preliminary data identifying the M5 muscarinic
acetylcholine receptor as a novel KCTD target by characterizing this novel signaling complex using in vitro
biochemical and biophysical techniques and live cell functional assays. Collectively, the results of this study will
serve to develop a detailed mechanistic understanding of KCTD modulation of GPCR signaling as well as laying
a foundation for investigation of newly discovered regulatory proteins and signaling components. Proposed
technology development efforts may also find broader utility in other areas of molecular neurobiology, further
enhancing the potential impact of this work."

Lung transplantation is the only treatment option for patients with end-stage lung disease. However, transplant
outcomes are significantly limited by the development of primary graft dysfunction (PGD), chronic lung allograft
dysfunction (CLAD), and complete organ rejection. With increasing lung transplant activity around the world,
new advancements are urgently needed to improve patient survival and quality of life.
At University Health Network (UHN), our team pioneered the Toronto Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP)
System—a breakthrough technology whereby donor lungs are preserved in a functional physiological state at
37°C and provided oxygen, nutrients, and other critical resources prior to transplantation. This enables donor
lungs to “breathe” outside of the body for up to 12 hours. Using EVLP, transplant teams can more objectively
assess marginal donor lungs and apply novel repair therapies.
To this end, our project will leverage EVLP to develop novel somatic cell gene editing (SCGE) therapeutic
strategies that can be applied to further enhance donor lungs. In preliminary research, we have shown that: 1)
upregulation of an anti-inflammatory cytokine called interleukin (IL)-10 improves lung quality and post-
transplant outcomes; and 2) recipient regulatory T cells (Tregs) that are resistant to tacrolimus (Tac) improve
the regulatory microenvironment in the transplanted organ. Our hypothesis is that applying SCGE techniques
during EVLP will enhance IL-10 gene and Treg cell therapies, which will immunomodulate the donor organ and
lessen the risk of transplant rejection.
In Aim 1, we will engineer new CRISPR editing technologies for use during EVLP and assess the feasibility
and therapeutic potential of this approach using pre-clinical in vivo models. In Aim 2, we will confer Tac
resistance in Treg cells using base editing and assess Treg efficacy in vivo using a human skin xenograft
model. In Aim 3, we will conduct proof-of-concept translational studies and assess the efficacy of our combined
therapies using clinically declined human lungs on EVLP, representing the closest approximation prior to
clinical application.
In our continued leadership of the field, we will enhance our strategic collaboration with Massachusetts
General Hospital to explore this multidisciplinary approach to long-term transplant tolerance. Our project goal
to combine SCGE and EVLP strategies will enable a grander pursuit of our long-term ambition: to ‘design’
better lungs that will last a lifetime in the transplant recipient. Achievement of our proposed objectives will
result in novel clinical applications and a paradigm shift in how we treat lung transplant recipients—away from
a life of immunosuppressive medications and towards self-sustaining and long-term graft tolerance."

Celiac disease (CeD) is one of the most prevalent yet understudied gastrointestinal disorders in the U.S., and
there is a critical need to understand genotype-phenotype relationships and underlying mechanisms, to
improve patient care. Likewise inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; comprising ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s
disease), another prevalent autoimmune/inflammatory disorder, presents stubborn challenges including a wide
range of severity and poorly predictable treatment responses. Genomics-based precision medicine for these
diseases will benefit from new approaches that can go beyond genome-wide association study (GWAS) data
to better stratify patients for disease risk, severity, and treatment response. Genotype-dependent allele-specific
DNA methylation (ASM), a focus of our lab (Tycko; HMH-CDI), can be a useful “post-GWAS” tool. Our work
has suggested that ASM differentially methylated regions (ASM DMRs) are footprints of allele-specific
transcription factor (TF) binding, and thus can act as signposts for functional regulatory SNPs (rSNPs) under
GWAS peaks, with direct relevance to CeD and IBD. To apply this approach to a key target cell type in CeD
and CD/IBD, namely the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC), as well as immune cell types, we are collaborating in
multi-PI format with Hamilton and her colleagues at CHOP, who have extensive expertise in biological and
clinical aspects of these diseases. Our project, bolstered by new and extensive preliminary data, combines
genomic + epigenomic mapping with mechanistic studies in cell lines and primary human IEC organoids, to
define which polymorphic TF binding motifs, and which transcriptional pathways and external environmental
signals have roles in CeD and CD/IBD. First, to map ASM DMRs under a greater number of CeD and IBD
GWAS peaks and identify tissue-specific ASM in these regions, we will generate whole-genome bisulfite
sequencing data (WGBS; methyl-seq) from key cell types, with a major focus on IECs. Second, to test
polymorphic TF binding motifs as the underlying mechanism leading to ASM at CeD and IBD risk loci, we will
carry out site-directed mutagenesis in human cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9 and assess the effects on ASM
and allele-specific gene expression. Third, to ask whether external factors in the cellular microenvironment,
converging on cellular TF levels, are reflected in changes in the strength of ASM at CeD and IBD risk loci, we
will manipulate IECs from organoid cultures using a series of disease-relevant external stimuli and identify
changes in ASM strength that correlate with changes in expression of cognate TFs. We expect that our
research will elucidate disease-specific and cell type-specific transcriptional and epigenetic pathways that are
both genotype-dependent and sensitive to acute and chronic effects of the cellular environment, with
implications for future precision medicine approaches that can go beyond GWAS and polygenic risk scores to
incorporate gene-environment interactions – leading to improved disease prevention and treatment."

Despite the widespread use and success of [18F]FDG-PET imaging in oncology, there are many situations where
[18F]FDG cannot be used for diagnosis or treatment monitoring, especially for cancers where there is high
background uptake, low tissue density, or slow-growing tumors. Infection or inflammation frequently leads to
false positives. Many tracers are being developed that provide improved contrast, sensitivity, and accuracy
compared to [18F]FDG. Of particular interest is the nucleoside analog [18F]FMAU, which is incorporated into DNA
when tumor cells divide, thus directly measuring increased cell proliferation, a universal hallmark of cancer.
Promising clinical data of [11C]FMAU and preclinical data of [18F]FMAU have led to initial clinical studies of
[18F]FMAU in cancer patients, and there is high interest in clinical studies of [18F]FMAU PET as a means to
assess treatment response in diverse cancer types. However, the radiosynthesis of [18F]FMAU is very
challenging, hindering translational efforts such as multicenter clinical trials that are needed to ensure sufficient
recruitment of patient populations. Over many years, Dr. Chen’s lab at USC has improved the [18F]FMAU
synthesis using a 1-pot process, but it still involves lengthy reaction steps (~3 h synthesis), uses corrosive and
unstable reagents that are not compatible with automated synthesis modules, and has a relatively low activity
yield (~5%), making adoption of this approach extremely difficult. To widely enable clinical studies, this proposal
leverages an innovative droplet-radiochemistry approach developed in Dr. van Dam’s lab at UCLA, and now
being commercialized by DropletPharm, in which reactions are performed in 10 µL volumes instead of 1 mL
volumes, enabling higher isotope concentration, higher reaction yields and much shorter synthesis time. A
preliminary study showed [18F]FMAU could be produced in <1 h. Our central hypotheses in this project are that
cell proliferation imaging can provide a superior assessment of treatment response (e.g. earlier response
detection and higher specificity to tumor growth) than other tracers, and that droplet technology can facilitate
widespread access to [18F]FMAU for clinical translation. Leveraging synergistic academic and industry expertise
and capabilities, our multi-PI team will advance the clinical translation of [18F]FMAU via four complementary
aims: (1) Develop an optimized droplet radiosynthesis of [18F]FMAU at multi-dose scale; (2) Customize a droplet
radiosynthesizer for [18F]FMAU production, then automate and validate the synthesis; (3) Pursue preclinical
studies to evaluate [18F]FMAU for assessing treatment response (compared to [18F]FDG and [18F]FLT) to support
future clinical trials; (4) Enable wide availability of [18F]FMAU by providing a low-cost self-shielded synthesizer,
developing reagent/consumable kits, establishing a user training program, and compiling an IND amendment
that can be referenced in future trials. We believe that quantitative [18F]FMAU-PET imaging will provide early
and accurate assessment of cancer treatment leading to individually tailored therapeutic plans with improved
patient outcomes."

A key remaining gap in our understanding of biological systems at the molecular level is how to structurally
annotate the “dark” protein families—the portion of protein families unsolved by experimental structure
determination techniques and inaccessible to homology modeling. Nearly a quarter of protein families are
currently dark, where molecular conformation is completely unknown and this gap is likely to expand further
with the rapid accumulation of new protein sequences without annotated structures. The key challenge is now
how to bridge this gap to gain a comprehensive understanding of biology and disease, thereby paving the way
to structure-based drug design at genomic scale. Computational protein modeling plays a key role in this effort
due to its scalability and genome-wide applicability. My laboratory focuses on the development and application
of novel data-driven computational modeling and refinement methods to increase accuracy and coverage of
protein structure prediction on genomic scale irrespective of homology. Future research focuses on improving
homology-free protein folding using multiscale de novo modeling driven by deep learning-based inter-residue
interactions, enhancing low-homology threading or fold recognition by formulating new algorithms for remote
template identification despite low evolutionary relatedness, and developing methods for high-resolution
restrained structure refinement guided by generalized ensemble search for driving computational models to
near-experimental accuracy. Proteome-wide computational modeling and refinement effort will be conducted,
leveraging our unique access to large-scale supercomputing infrastructure, to build high-confidence models
covering the dark protein families, which will be organized in a database for public access. This comprehensive
database of structural annotations will shed light on the structures, functions, and interactions of the dark
proteome, with broad implications in drug discovery and human health. Software and web servers will be freely
disseminated to help worldwide community of biomedical researchers to apply these methods to their specific
research problems, thus multiplying the impact of computational modeling on basic research in biology and
medicine. My research program will involve close collaborations with other NIGMS-supported investigators,
create training opportunities for the next generation of researchers including members from underrepresented

Over 2 million people are now estimated to have an opioid use disorder (OUD). The U.S. health care system is
struggling to meet this challenge, as the need for OUD treatment far exceeds the supply of qualified clinicians
who can prescribe and monitor medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). MOUD are effective at reducing
overdose deaths and improving outcomes, but are vastly underused, with only 25-40% of adults with OUD
receiving MOUD. Rates of OUD are particularly high among Medicaid enrollees, and Medicaid is the largest
payor of OUD treatment services. Studies have demonstrated racial, ethnic, geographic, and age differences in
overdose death rates, patterns of opioid drug use and OUD, and patterns of treatment. Yet, few studies have
undertaken more nuanced approaches to examining the quality of OUD care that take into account differences
that may compound across dimensions such as race, gender, and age groups, referred to as intersectionality.
Observed disparities may reflect regional limitations in available treatment providers as well as differences in
upstream pathways to diagnosis and treatment (e.g., care after an overdose, access to primary care).
Using real-time Medicaid claims data from North Carolina, supplemented by claims from Medicare and private
insurance (with these sources together accounting for over three-quarters of all North Carolina residents) will
allow us to characterize the quality of OUD care delivered by each provider across payers. We will examine
differences in OUD care quality by intersectional status and examine key drivers of those differences. Our first
aim is to assess differences in the quality of OUD care by intersectional status. We will also examine whether
the presence of other chronic behavioral health and medical conditions moderate these disparities in OUD care
quality by intersectional status. Our second aim is to assess the extent to which differences in the receipt of
high-quality OUD care by intersectional status are due to differences in the availability of providers who provide
high-quality OUD treatment, by geographic areas. Finally, our third aim is to compare differences by
intersectional status in the receipt of high-quality OUD care before, during, and after North Carolina transitions
its Medicaid program from fee-for-service to capitation in July 2021. We will use national Medicaid data to
compare patterns of OUD care quality in North Carolina to the country as a whole. We will also explore the use
of electronic health record data to provide an alternative assessment of OUD quality of care by examining
clinician notes, orders, and lab tests. Understanding the differences in OUD care quality by intersectional
status and the factors underlying and driving those differences is critical to attaining an equitable, high-quality
health care system. Our results will guide policy and practice aimed at improving OUD care engagement and
quality for all individuals."

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and occurs in all ethnic and racial groups.
A multitude of genetic studies in AD have identified multiple AD associated genes and loci, but a large portion of
the genetic contribution to AD remains unknown. The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is using
large-scale sequencing efforts to increase our knowledge about the genetic variation that influences AD,
particularly rare genetic variants that enhance AD risk or protect against AD. In the most recent wave of funding,
the ADSP is sequencing individuals from the ADSP Follow-up Study (FUS) through AG057659 and AG062943.
These efforts were specifically designed to improve racial and ethnic diversity in the ADSP datasets as well as
to acquire unique and powerful data sets for gene discovery in NHW individuals, such as the Amish protective
variant (AMISHPV) dataset, several large autopsy-confirmed series and the ADGC's early-onset AD dataset.
The purpose of these studies has been to capitalize on differences in genetic backgrounds that may facilitate
the identification of new protective and risk loci and ultimately address health disparities for AD and related
disorders in underserved populations. Including the cohorts in this application, the ADSP-FUS will perform WGS
on nearly 30,000 individuals. An added benefit of this application is the processing and delivery of high quality
WGS and phenotype data on the new cohorts in this application. Specifically we propose to: (1) Increase the
diversity and further enrich the clinical phenotype data of the ADSP through inclusion of ~1900 AD cases and
controls from the Alzheimer Disease Center (ADC) Hispanic cohort, ~1500 AD cases and controls from the Faroe
Islands, and ~3,200 AD cases and controls from the well characterized ethnically diverse A4 Clinical Trial Cohort;
(2) work closely with the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer's Disease (NCRAD) in assembling DNA and
blood on these existing cohorts which will ultimately serve as a central resource for the Alzheimer's disease
research community; (3) generate genome-wide SNP array data and WGS data for all collected samples using
established resources; (4) collaborate with NIAGADS, GCAD and the HIHG CGESG-PGNC QC Teams in
processing, storage, and delivery of final datasets to NIAGADS for public data release; and (5) harmonize clinical
data from newly acquired and existing FUS datasets to generate high quality inferentially equivalent phenotypes
and endophenotypes. This project will merge several new cohorts into the ADSP-FUS to further enhance the
ADSP as an invaluable resource for the Alzheimer's disease (AD) research community. These efforts will speed
discoveries of targets for AD diagnosis, prevention, and treatment for all populations."

One primary reason for the gap of knowledge is the inability to observe the hemodynamics of placenta in vivo.
Currently, B-mode and Doppler ultrasound are the primary imaging modalities in imaging the placenta and its
vasculature. However, significant limitations exist in the ability of Doppler ultrasound to visualize and measure
detailed flow velocities in placental vasculature. It has low sensitivity to small vessels in the placenta, including
spiral arteries and chorionic villi, and can only measure flow velocity along the ultrasound beam direction,
requiring tedious manual angle correction for flow along any of the visible vessels if quantitative information is
desired. These limitations make conventional Doppler ultrasound poorly suited for imaging the hemodynamics
of the complex vasculature of human placenta. To provide full and detailed characterization of placental
hemodynamics, we propose to develop a vector flow velocity imaging technique using deep neural network
models and multiple angle plane wave ultrasound transmits. This technique will be able to quantitatively image
both the flow velocity magnitudes and flow directions of millimeter-diameter vessels in human placenta over a
large field of view. Aim 1 and 2 will be focused on the technical development of the technique to provide a semi-
real-time vector flow imaging system based on a research ultrasound scanner, paving way for Aim 3, which will
be focused on validating the clinical value of the technique on a pilot clinical study to image the hemodynamics
in spiral arteries and chorionic villi of pregnant women. Successful completion of the project will provide a novel
technique for the scientific and early clinical assessment of placental hemodynamics, development, and
abnormalities including the development of the villous tree structure, placenta accreta, preeclampsia, and
placental insufficiency. During the project, the PI will receive training in machine learning, obstetrics, translational
research, and career development skills, which will transition the PI into an independent faculty."
10887384,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the United States continues to rise with majority of
patients diagnosed with advanced stage disease, limited treatment options and poor prognosis. HCC is
projected to become the 3rd leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2030. The earlier detection of HCC is
necessary towards reducing the high HCC mortality rates since those with early stage disease have multiple,
potentially curative, treatment options available. Current guidelines recommend those with cirrhosis undergo
six-monthly liver ultrasound with or without serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), however ultrasound is not sensitive
for early lesions and the reported performance of AFP varies widely.
We will develop and evaluate two novel biomarker screening algorithms that aim to improve the early detection
of HCC. We have previously proposed a parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) screening algorithm for AFP that
increased earlier HCC detection through personalized thresholds that incorporate prior AFP results. Blood-
based biomarkers are a most promising, cost-effective tool for widespread HCC surveillance and there are
multiple novel HCC biomarkers under development. In Aim 1 we will generalize the PEB algorithm to enable
joint screening with multiple biomarkers (e.g. AFP, DCP, AFP-L3, promising novel biomarkers). We propose to
develop a robust decision rule for multiple HCC biomarkers that uses prior screening history to increase earlier
HCC detection in the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis Trial. A second screening
strategy is based on the observation that patients under active surveillance have continuously updated clinical
and laboratory data collected but not used systematically to improve screening. In Aim 2 we will develop and
evaluate a fully Bayesian screening algorithm that combines longitudinal AFP, other laboratory markers and
clinical covariates to increase the likelihood of earlier detection of HCC. Our goal is to improve AFP screening
performance through the robust development of joint models for AFP, other laboratory tests and clinical data.
Once validated, this algorithm could be implemented based on current clinical practice. We will develop and
refine the algorithm in two large retrospective cohorts: a Department of Veterans Affairs national cirrhosis
cohort, a Kaiser Permanente Northern California cirrhosis cohort. In Aim 3 we will evaluate both algorithms in
the Hepatocellular carcinoma Early Detection Strategy (HEDS) study and the Trans Texas HCC Consortium
(THCCC); the largest prospective cirrhosis cohorts assembled in the United States to date. We will leverage
our access to some of the most authoritative cirrhosis studies to build and evaluate HCC screening algorithms,
with a target of increasing the sensitivity of HCC screening by 33% while maintaining a low false positive rate
to ensure the feasibility of HCC surveillance. Additionally, the statistical methods developed will have broad
application in other cancer screening settings (e.g. lung, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancer).

10887386,"The incidence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPV+ OPSCC)
has rapidly increased over the last two decades surpassing uterine cervical cancer as the most
frequently diagnosed HPV-associated cancer in the United States by 2012. This “epidemic” is
expected to continue through 2060. Patients are typically diagnosed with metastatic nodal disease
treated with high dose radiation with concurrent cisplatin. This treatment was not designed for
HPV+ OPSCC but was based on results of trials of therapeutic escalation for HPV-negative
cancers. This aggressive treatment results in lifelong morbidity, and side effects of therapy may
also shorten lifespan. For the approximately 25% of these patients who will recur, late
identification of recurrence limits salvage options for a portion. Early detection of initial disease
and recurrences would allow less morbid therapy that may also increase survival. The head and
neck oncology community has recently focused on personalization of therapy for HPV+ OPSCC,
in particular on therapeutic de-intensification. The major stumbling block that is preventing
widespread adoption of these therapeutic strategies is inability to identify patients at low risk of
recurrence who are appropriate for less intensive therapy.
 Our group identified and piloted prognostic biomarkers and an assay for detection of treatment
response and for early detection of initial or recurrent HPV+ OPSCC. The prognostic biomarker
is based on deletion or mutations of TRAF3 or CYLD in tumors. Analysis of the TCGA cohort
revealed that survival of HPV+ OPSCC patients with TRAF or CYLD defects was significantly
better than those whose tumors lacked defects. Remarkably, HPV+ OPSCC tumors lacking
TRAF3 or CYLD defects had survival that was indistinguishable from HPV-negative patients,
suggesting that the improved survival in HPV+ OPSCC is largely attributable to the subset with
these mutations. We also have piloted detection of circulating HPVDNA using ultrasensitive digital
PCR as a measure of treatment response, predictor of recurrence, and for early detection of
recurrent disease.
 These assays that we piloted for prognostication, as well as treatment response and early
detection of initial or recurrent HPV+ OPSCC require validation before they will be clinically useful.
Here we propose to partner with MD Anderson Cancer Center to leverage an ongoing trial and
use detection of circulating HPVDNA to distinguish patients with oral HPV infection from those
with early HPV+ OPSCC. We will also conduct a prospective observational clinical trial to validate
TRAF3 and CYLD mutations as prognostic biomarkers and validate detection of circulating
plasma HPVDNA for early detection of recurrent HPV+ OPSCC. Validation of prognostic
biomarkers will aid appropriate selection of HPV+ OPSCC patients for de-intensified therapy while
also identifying those who need aggressive or novel therapies to improve survival. Validation of a
tool for prediction of response and early detection of recurrence will also change practice by
identifying patients who are at increased risk of recurrence for heightened surveillance or early
intervention."
10884171,"Diversification of the workforce of the biomedical sciences is of high strategic importance to the United States. Diversity of the workforce has been shown to increase diversity of thought, improve creativity and hasten progress. In addition, with the increase in diversity within the population of the United States in the next 30 years, we will need a diversified workforce to keep up with the demand for jobs in the health and biomedical sciences. The BS/MS Program in Neuroscience of the Atlanta University Consortium has a long-term goal of increasing the proportion of and success of under-represented minorities in the field of Neuroscience. The underlying hypothesis of this grant application is that exposure of students early in their collegiate academic career to neuroscience research will lead to more of these students choosing a career related to neuroscience research. In addition, this exposure will fortify their background in neuroscience, and give them valuable experience in critical and quantitative thinking as well as experimental design. Under-represented minority students are recruited to the dual degree program near the end of their sophomore year. As Juniors and Seniors, students take a rigorous, graduate level neuroscience core curriculum at Morehouse School of Medicine, while still attending their undergraduate institution. The close proximity to Morehouse School of Medicine of the participating institutions of the Atlanta University Consortium (Morehouse College, Spelman College and Clark Atlanta University) allows students to walk to their graduate classes and laboratories on a daily basis. In this way, students can concurrently fulfill requirements for both the Bachelor of Science degree at their home institution and the master’s degree in Neuroscience granted by Morehouse School of Medicine. In the summer between Junior and Senior years, students start mentored laboratory work that contributes toward their master’s thesis. After graduating from their undergraduate institution, these students will continue to spend 10 – 11 more months almost exclusively devoted to bench research. During the Master year, BS/MS students also participate in an intensive MATLAB bootcamp with beginning Ph.D. students in the Program in Neuroscience at Harvard Medical School. In addition to sharpening quantitative skills, the Harvard experience is a great networking opportunity. Career counseling of BS/MS students is given throughout the three-year program. The Master year ends with a public thesis defense leading to the earned master’s degree. In order to attract top tier students from the Atlanta University Consortium, tuition is paid by the program and students also receive a stipend for their time working in the laboratory. This experience will hopefully increase the probability of under-represented minority students to become successful in career tracts as Ph.D. scientists, M.D., Ph.D. physician scientists, or physicians interested in neurology, neurosurgery or other fields where they can participate in research or easily collaborate with researchers."
10884176,"ABSTRACT
The goal of this new T32 post-doctoral training grant is to train exceptional physician-scientists for
independent careers in age-related conditions. We will recruit physician-scientist trainees at the
completion of clinical training and before the initiation of their independent research career. Given the
growing number of older adults globally, the health-related issues of older adults will dominate the health
care landscape. Physician-scientists are well poised to conduct translational research relevant to the older
population as they can appreciate the clinical implications of pre-clinical research and have a unique ability
to identify areas of research likely to have a substantial impact on clinical care. University of Michigan
(UM) is uniquely positioned to train promising physician-scientists in age-related research as UM has
robust programs in geroscience/biology of aging, geriatrics, clinical medicine and health policy research.
To train physician-scientists in translational medicine in age-related conditions, we will include mentors
that represent the spectrum of translational medical research from preclinical research, through to research
in healthy and diseased human subjects (i.e., translational), to public policy and population health. The
Director (Dr. Mody) and the two Co-Directors (Drs. Goldstein and Min) of this program are all physician-
scientists who examine various aspects of age-related conditions across this translational research
spectrum. Dr. Mody is a clinical interventionalist who has active collaborations with investigators who
conduct basic genomic research to scientists in healthcare research policy. Dr. Goldstein examines how
aging impacts inflammation by employing pre-clinical models of atherosclerosis, influenza viral infection,
and organ transplantation. Dr. Min is a health services outcomes researcher with expertise in linking
quality measures and quality improvement with clinical outcomes. Our training program includes faculty
preceptors in each of the pre-clinical, translational and public policy domains. In addition to the individual
expertise of the faculty, our program also will leverage several successful programs at UM including: The
University of Michigan Older Americans Independence Center, the Michigan Institute for Clinical and
Health Research, Biology of Aging, Institute for Healthcare Policy and Research, Michigan Biology of
Cardiovascular Aging and Institute for Social Research. We expect that our new training program will lead
to a cadre of outstandingly trained young physician-scientists who will pursue cutting-edge translational
research in age-related conditions and themselves become mentors and leaders in the field."
10884263,"Understanding the process of neural degeneration is important in order to understand the responses of the
nervous system to injury and disease. A common model used in such studies is the distal segment of the sciatic
nerve after nerve transection or crush. Following such a lesion, Wallerian degeneration occurs in which the distal
segment of the nerve fragments and degenerates, and the resulting axonal and myelin debris are cleared away.
Interestingly, while this process occurs rapidly in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), it is extremely slow in
the central nervous system (CNS), and, partly because of this, regeneration is generally ineffective in the brain
and spinal cord. It is widely believed that inflammatory macrophages (mφs) derived from blood-borne monocytes
are required for the phagocytosis of axonal and myelin debris. Immune cells enter injured tissue in response to
chemotactic cytokines or chemokines. A major population of monocytes infiltrates into the distal nerve after
axotomy in response to the chemokine CCL2, which acts on monocytes via the chemokine receptor CCR2. In
mice in which the gene for CCR2 is knocked out, CCR2+ monocytes do not enter the nerve. It was, therefore,
very surprising when we found that the clearance of both myelin and axonal protein is normal in Ccr2 knockout
mice. We subsequently found that an important reason for the normal clearance appears to be phagocytosis by
neutrophils, an immune cell not previously implicated in Wallerian degeneration. In fact, although neutrophil
actions in the CNS are beginning to be examined, for example in models of multiple sclerosis, there are almost
no studies on their actions in the PNS. Our preliminary evidence using the neutrophil-depleting antibody anti-
Ly6G suggests, but does not prove, that neutrophils directly phagocytose and metabolize myelin. We will
examine this hypothesis by examining the clearance of myelin proteins by western blotting before and after
neutrophil depletion and by co-labeling tissue with Oil Red O, a stain for myelin metabolites, and with cell type
specific neutrophils antibodies. We have shown that after axotomy two neutrophil attracting chemokines are
induced in the sciatic nerve, CXCL1 and CXCL2. To determine whether these chemokines and their receptor,
CXCR2, are involved in neutrophil infiltration into the nerve, we will use neutralizing antibodies, pharmacological
antagonists, and knockout mice. We will investigate also whether the involvement of neutrophils in Wallerian
degeneration is important for subsequent regeneration. “Wallerian-like” degeneration occurs in several
demyelinating neuropathies, and we will examine whether neutrophils play a role in this phenomenon. We will
use a mouse model for Guillain Barré syndrome based on our recent finding that neutrophils enter into the sciatic
nerve in this model. Following up on our unexpected findings of normal clearance of myelin in Ccr2 knockout
mice, our experiments will examine the role of neutrophils in Wallerian degeneration and in a demyelinating
disease. Given the known importance of Wallerian degeneration for nerve regeneration due to the removal of
myelin proteins, our studies will suggest ways of improving regeneration in the PNS and perhaps in the CNS."

pathogenesis topics. Our goal is to produce individuals with high quality training, in topics aligned with the NIH
priorities, and who will be able to enter careers that engage them in national effort to control HIV disease and
its. We have designed a training plan that is in step with the current HIV/AIDS research priorities. We will train
the next generation of HIV/AIDS scientists in four focus groups of research training. These include: (1) HIV
latency persistence and cure; (2) Next generation therapies; (3) Approaches to reducing HIV incidence and (4)
Comorbidities and coinfections. Over the next 5 years, we will (i) Recruit highly qualified pre- and post-doctoral
trainees into the program (where the pre-doctoral trainees will include both PhD and MD/PhD trainees and the
post-doctoral trainees can be either PhD or MD holders); (ii) Provide opportunities for training with mentoring
from outstanding basic and translational HIV/AIDS researchers at Einstein using modern, cutting edge research
facilities; (iii) Provide monitoring, evaluation and advice by internal and external senior HIV/AIDS scientists; (iv)
Provide a platform of regular work-in-progress meetings attended by a community of translational HIV/AIDS
mentors, all current and previous T32-supported trainees in residence and other trainees of the participating
trainers on a regular basis and (v) provide opportunities for career guidance for both traditional research careers
(including grantsmanship mentoring) and non-traditional careers. The 15 faculty trainers on this training grant
each work on national priority areas of HIV/AIDS research, engage in highly collaborative interdisciplinary
research, are all funded (bringing in over 26 million dollars of federal funds to Einstein this year) and participate
in a unique training program that collaborates with the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Einstein-
Montefiore Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), the MACS-WIHS Combined Clinical Cohort (MWCCS), the
NIGMS-supported Cell and Molecular Biology and Genetics (CMBG) training program aimed at maximizing
training opportunities for our trainees. The presence of highly relevant centers and programs, program projects
focused on microbicides or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) products, robustly-funded trainers and the superb
research facilities, together create an exciting environment for training pre- and postdoctoral trainees in HIV/AIDS
research at Einstein. This training program, as outlined in this application, plays a catalytic role to seamlessly
bring together multiple opportunities for trainees in the context of our training program. This training program
thus provides a comprehensive and coordinated platform for training of pre- and postdoctoral trainees in
translational AIDS research at Einstein."
10884360,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Research linking unintended pregnancy with increased risk of adverse maternal and child health outcomes is
fraught with significant conceptual and scientific limitations, including cross-sectional designs, residual
confounding, and simplistic, retrospective assessment of pregnancy intentions. A critical gap in our scientific
knowledge thus remains: Are the adverse maternal health outcomes associated with unintended pregnancy
and childbearing due to unintended pregnancy itself or rather contextual factors that are associated with
increased risk of unintended pregnancy? The proposed research is the first to apply state-of-the-art methods
and theory to the measurement of pregnancy intentions to rigorously address this long-standing scientific gap.
This prospective study follows a cohort of 2,200 non-pregnant women over one year, measuring preferences
about a possible pregnancy using a new, robust instrument: the Desire to Avoid Pregnancy (DAP) scale. This
validated psychometric
scale captures a continuum of cognitive, affective, and practical considerations about
pregnancy and childbearing, moving beyond conceptually limited “intending” and “not intending” labels.
Participants experiencing incident pregnancies – and a matched subset of non-pregnant women with similar
pregnancy preferences – are then followed for an additional three years to measure mental and physical health
outcomes during pregnancy and after birth. This innovative design positions us to address three aims. In Aim
1, we will identify the time-varying and invariant contextual factors in women’s lives that shape their
preconception pregnancy preferences, such as relationship factors and financial stability, and test how
preferences predict incident pregnancy. In Aim 2, among women who experience a new pregnancy, we will
examine the relationship between prospectively assessed pregnancy preferences and maternal health
outcomes, accounting for temporally important confounding factors (from Aim 1). In Aim 3, we will investigate
how the relationship between pregnancy and adverse health outcomes differs by pregnancy preferences.
Specifically, with our matched design, we will compare health outcomes among pregnant women to those of
women who best represent their counterfactual: women who had similar pregnancy preferences yet who did
not experience pregnancy. Thereby, we emulate a hypothetic trial in which women, conditional on
confounders, are randomly assigned to pregnancy, allowing us to examine whether the negative health effects
of pregnancy are amplified among those who most desire to avoid pregnancy. Achieving these aims will
contribute new insights into the health repercussions of unintended pregnancy for women and elucidate the
degree to which adverse outcomes stem from the intention status of pregnancies or underlying social and
contextual factors. These insights are critical to developing appropriately focused maternal morbidity
prevention efforts. Robust data on health consequences of attaining one’s preferred pregnancy outcomes are
also needed to inform interventions around contraceptive access and reproductive autonomy."
10884361,"Abstract
Our goal is to develop a technology platform to repeatedly measure cancer biomarkers from a few drops of blood
collected from cancer patients at home. Our team identified that blood exosomal microRNA-375 predicts time to
survival of patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We succeeded in measuring
microRNA-375 in small volume blood samples collected by mCRPC patients at home, which we are now using
for longitudinal analysis of individual patients as they undergo treatment. This capacity to collect samples from
home has increased clinical value in the current era in which a pandemic necessitates decreased hospital visits
and encourages home-based care in oncology. However due to the small sample volume, it is not currently
possible to measure a panel of related biomarkers which are needed to address the broad genetic spectrum of
mCRPC, including genetic changes that drive therapy-induced clonal selection. Further, we have determined
that additional normalization standards are needed to improve validation and reproducibility. Therefore, our goal
is to perform high-dimensional multiplexing of well-characterized nucleic acid sequences from these home-
collected blood samples using a new assay called single-molecule flow (SiM-Flow). SiM-Flow allows rapid digital
counting of nucleic acids that have been extended and fluorescently labeled using a fluorescence-based flow
cytometer. We propose to develop and optimize instrumentation and barcoding technologies for quantification
of 20 distinct nucleic acid biomarkers that have been shown to be prognostic or predictive of therapy response
in mCRPC in addition to 10 normalization sequences, using samples isolated from home-collected fingerstick
blood specimens from patients. In particular, we will develop (1) a microfluidic single-molecule counting
instrument that evaluates femtoliter volumetric partitions with 5-color readout, (2) 5-color fluorescent labels based
on compact, brightness-equalized quantum dots optimized for dispersion profiles of optical prisms and spectral
sensitivities of silicon photomultiplier arrays, and (3) nucleic acid coding schemes for diverse exosomal
microRNA and mRNA targets. We will validate agreement between this new multiplexed digital assay and digital
droplet PCR, optimize normalization probes, and correlate patient survival with the biomarker panel and
measurements from at-home samples. Our team has broad expertise needed to accomplish this work, including
specialists in molecular probes and single-molecule fluorescence (Andrew Smith), prospective clinical trials and
mCRPC biomarker discovery (Manish Kohli), microfluidic devices with optical integration for blood analysis
(Rashid Bashir), and clinical biostatistics (Jonathan Chipman). Success in this project will have the potentially
transformative technological outcome of an instrument and assay for rapid, longitudinal evaluation of numerous
circulating cancer biomarkers in individual patients using biospecimens that are readily collected at home. This
platform could fill a void in clinical oncology by reporting molecular changes occurring in metastases in response
to therapies, which may be used to match and finely tune treatments to individual patient response profiles."
10884362,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The proposed K01 application is designed to provide Nancy Jao, Ph.D., with the mentored research and
training necessary to transition into an independent clinical scientist with a tobacco regulatory relevant program
of research. The FDA has long indicated interest in banning menthol as a characterizing flavor in combustible
cigarettes due to its role in facilitating the initiation and use of tobacco products and increasing the number of
smoking-related deaths. Smoking-induced inflammation is a leading pathway by which cigarette smoking
contributes to increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality in smokers. Elevations in
biomarkers of inflammation can be detected early, even in asymptomatic individuals, as a subclinical indicator
of CVD risk. Basic science studies have shown that menthol flavoring can cause increases in inflammatory
response and dysfunction beyond the effects of smoking. However, it is unknown whether menthol cigarette
(MC) use may elevate biomarkers of inflammation in smokers and increase CVD risk compared to non-menthol
cigarette (NMC) use. Additionally, while it is expected that a MC ban will improve health outcomes for smokers
who quit or switch to non-combustible products, it is unknown whether there will be reductions in inflammation
for those who switch from MC to NMC smoking. In Study 1, we aim to evaluate differences in biomarkers of
systemic inflammation and CVD risk between MC and NMC smokers in nationally-representative, longitudinal
Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. In Study 2, we aim to examine how switching
from MC to NMC smoking may impact biomarkers of systemic inflammation, smoking behavior, and subjective
responses related to smoking. MC smokers (N=68) will be recruited for a five-week study, with one-week of
baseline of MC smoking (Phase 1), followed by four weeks of switching to study-provided, brand-matched
NMCs (Phase 2). Biomarkers of systemic inflammation (e.g., hsCRP, interleukin cytokines) and tobacco
exposure (e.g., cotinine, carbon monoxide) will be analyzed from blood samples before, during, and after
switching. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods will also be gathered to measure patterns of
smoking and smoking-related subjective responses. The proposed research is significant and directly targets
FDA's interest in understanding the impact of flavorings on the health effects of tobacco use. Throughout the
five-year award, Dr. Jao will be mentored by an impressive mentorship team in (1) translational research in
biobehavioral and health effects of tobacco use, particularly relating to biomarkers of inflammation and CVD
risk; (2) longitudinal research methods and advanced statistical analyses, including utilization of the PATH
study dataset and EMA methodology; and (3) design and implementation of human clinical trial studies with
tobacco regulatory implications. Understanding the impact of MC use on these sensitive subclinical biomarkers
prior to CVD diagnosis can help the FDA identify and quantify cardiovascular health hazards of MC use,
particularly for those who may continue to use combustible cigarettes if a MC ban is implemented by the FDA."
10884463,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neonatal sepsis is a life-threatening disease that affects 2 out of every 1,000 live births in the US. Caused by an
invasive bloodstream infection (BSI) occurring either at the time of birth or soon thereafter, the disease’s initial
clinical manifestations are often non-specific, variable, at times subtle, and often common to signs of stress. Early
diagnosis followed by appropriate antimicrobial intervention is a key predictor of outcomes. Selection of
appropriate antimicrobials is limited by the current diagnostic process for detection and identification of BSIs
which all rely on primary blood cultures. Cultures are slow, often requiring days to yield a result, and prone to
false-negatives due to maternal antibiotics. In the absence of diagnostic confirmation, treatment is initiated upon
suspicion of sepsis with broad spectrum antibiotics. Unfortunately, this strategy often misses the target and is
associated with side effects, including damage to developing microbiomes. It is therefore critical to advance
innovative diagnostic approaches which do not rely on culturing in order to facilitate accurate diagnosis and
timely transition to evidence-based treatments.
To address this unmet need, HelixBind developed RaPID/neo, a fully automated, sample-to-answer test for
identifying BSIs directly from newborn blood within ~3 hours, without cultures. The test incorporates a broad test
menu of 18 bacterial and fungal pathogens that make up the vast majority of neonatal sepsis cases. RaPID/neo
is implemented on the RaPID (Resistance and Pathogen IDentification) platform, incorporating single-use test
cassettes and a bench top Analyzer. RaPID/neo provides single CFUs/ml sensitivity across its test menu and is
not confounded by polymicrobial infections nor prior antimicrobial treatment. In a preliminary clinical
assessment, RaPID/neo demonstrated >92% sensitivity and 99% specificity across the assay.
In this proposed Direct-to-Phase II project, HelixBind will build on its preliminary data to further product
development by addressing analytical challenges associated with developing a test targeting this vulnerable
patient population. We will review our findings and proposed studies for regulatory clearance with the FDA
during a Pre-Submission process with the agency. Leveraging agency feedback, we will design an in-hospital
study aimed at challenging our clinical studies plan in preparation for the pivotal trials for FDA clearance.
To succeed in this endeavor, we have assembled an accomplished team with expertise in assay development,
instrumentation, consumables manufacturing, clinical microbiology, and infectious disease as well as a
successful track record of commercializing IVD platforms and assays. Together, we will build upon our
preliminary work to complete product development, finalize a regulatory pathway, and challenge the system
with an in-hospital study. Upon completion of this project, we will be well placed to initiate formal Analytical
and Clinical studies for FDA clearance of RaPID/neo."

Acute neural injury from subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-associated cerebral infarction occurs in 30-40% of
patients who survive the initial hemorrhage, leads to death and disability, and most strongly correlates with 3-
month outcome. There is also a significant rate of long-term cognitive deficits. Current understanding of the
pathophysiology of post-SAH cerebral infarction points to injury cascades involving decreased nitric oxide (NO)
bioavailability and oxidative stress. Under normal conditions, NO signaling pathways regulate cerebral blood
flow by mediating cerebral vasodilation and inhibiting platelet adhesion. However, with SAH, red blood cells
lyse and release hemoglobin, which is a spasmogenic. Hemoglobin scavenges NO; stimulates production of a
nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor (ADMA); and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen
species (RNS). We believe the recently-identified peptide hormone adropin is a promising therapeutic target for
post-SAH cerebral infarction. Our group and others have shown adropin is abundantly expressed in the brain,
regulates the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) pathway, correlates with markers of oxidative stress,
and reduces brain endothelial permeability in response to simulated ischemia. Our hypothesis is that adropin
confers protection against acute neural injury from post-SAH cerebral infarction. Our overall goal in this
proposal is to demonstrate the protective role of adropin in SAH and investigate the underlying molecular and
cellular mechanisms of this protection. Our preliminary data support this hypothesis by showing that SAH
decreases brain adropin expression, and that endogenous adropin overexpression by transgenic mice with a
β-actin-driven adropin transgene (AdrTg) or treatment with synthetic adropin in the SAH model reduces
cerebral edema, preserves tight junction protein expression, abolishes microthrombosis, increases eNOS
phosphorylation, prevents cerebral vasospasm, and inhibits neuronal apoptosis. Aim 1 is to determine whether
adropin confers protection against acute neural injury after SAH when given in a clinically translatable
timepoint after SAH. In Aim 2, we will study mediators that regulate Enho gene expression in the setting of
SAH. In Aim 3, we will study whether adropin neurovascular protection is mediated via eNOS activity. We
expect this study will provide novel knowledge on adropin-mediated protection against acute neural injury after
SAH. The significance of this study is that it is directly translatable and the first to investigate the fundamentals
of adropin regulation in brain endothelial cells after SAH. This study will provide the preclinical data for a Phase
1/2 human clinical trial in SAH patients."

 Structural racism and discrimination (SRD) is a salient mechanism perpetuating racial gaps in health.
Emerging studies have documented the impact of SRD on negative pregnancy outcomes, including higher
rates of preterm birth among African American (AA) women and higher rates of mortality among AA mothers
and infants. Often an underexplored population, women during the preconception period are a critical group
impacting this disparity, as exposures during pre-pregnancy period significantly impact the mother-infant dyad
across the lifespan. In particular, studies document that the pervasive and lasting impact of chronic stressors
due to SRD, may affect AA women of childbearing age by creating a “weathering” effect, that is associated with
inflammation and distinct epigenetic patterns, which can lead to deleterious outcomes postconception. There
is a critical need to explore the etiologic pathways during the pre-pregnancy period that are influenced by SRD-
related trauma and contribute adverse outcomes in the mother-infant dyad.
 Trauma/stress exposure can impact the health of individuals from historically marginalized groups through
modifications to the epigenome, which can induce changes in gene expression affecting the regulation of
physiologic responses including endocrine, immune, cardiovascular systems, etc. Considering AA women
carry a disproportionate burden of incidence, morbidity, and mortality from chronic diseases, it is important to
examine how preconception trauma from SRD alters the epigenome in women of childbearing potential. These
stress-induced epigenetic modifications can be carried forward through the germline, to the potential detriment
of successive generations. Thus, we hypothesize that elevated SRD-related stress in AA women is associated
with epigenetic signatures of inflammation and innate immune dysfunction during the preconception period,
promoting a suboptimal environment for pregnancy. These distinct epigenetic alterations will be inherited in the
offspring via specific germline differentially methylated regions. This proposal will leverage an ongoing R01 to
investigate the impact of SRD-related stress on women prior to conception and we will include a longitudinal
cohort of mother-infant pairs from early gestation to 12-months following delivery to evaluate the transmission
of SRD-related epigenetic signatures from mother-to-child. Three specific aims are proposed: 1) To determine
the burden of structural racism and discrimination on stress, systemic inflammation, and epigenetic signatures
among preconception AA women and 2) To define the longitudinal impact of maternal SRD-related stress on
the inheritance of distinct epigenetic signatures in the offspring. This proposal offers an exceptional
opportunity to understand the etiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes in AA women and identify the
biomarkers and mechanisms that underlie the lasting biological effect of SRD, as these correlates impact not
only at an individual level but also generational."

Maternal obesity (MO) affects >60% of pregnancies in the US and is associated with fetal re-programming of metabolic disease susceptibility in the offspring, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is the most prevalent liver disease worldwide, affecting >30% of obese youth, without approved pharmacological interventions. This project is therefore significant because it addresses a critical unmet need for developing safe and effective therapeutics for MO to attenuate NAFLD risk, beginning in utero. In rodents, non-human primates (NHP) and humans, we and others have shown that MO pregnancies exhibit altered microbiome (MB) function, subclinical endotoxemia, metabolic inflammation and oxidative stress, resulting in placental inflammation and functional maladaptation (nutrient transport, blood flow). These maladaptive signals converge and epigenetically program fetal bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), monocytes and liver macrophages (Mφ) to a pro-inflammatory phenotype that contributes to programming the fetal liver (glucose, lipid control, NAFLD susceptibility). Using a novel olive baboon (Papio anubis) NHP model of Western diet induced (WD)/MO, our preliminary data show that WD/MO-exposed juvenile offspring exhibit elevated NAFLD markers by 1 year of age. Our rodent studies have shown that supplementation of WD/MO dams with the microbial nutrient and dietary antioxidant pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a bioactive compound with potent immunomodulatory activity, protects offspring from NAFLD; further, the gut MB may contribute to driving PQQ’s hepatoprotective effects. Our promising preliminary data in obese female baboons show that PQQ significantly attenuates systemic subclinical endotoxemia (LPS) and inflammation (CRP, sCD163), and improves serum cholesterol. PQQ targets mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, inflammation, and lipid metabolism, shown to be mediators of metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming in HSPCs, liver and bone marrow Mφ. However, the safety and efficacy of PQQ as a therapeutic capable of preventing programming of NAFLD in obese pregnancy have not been established in a translatable, preclinical model. This proposal aims to supplement WD/MO dams with PQQ and use state-of- the-art large scale sequencing approaches integrated with clinical biochemical measures to test the following hypothesis: PQQ during WD/MO pregnancy Aim 1) improves maternal gut MB function and relieves maternal metabolic inflammation, Aim 2) ameliorates placental maladaptation and inflammation, and Aim 3) blunts liver and bone marrow epigenetic reprogramming, mitigating emergence of a NAFLD phenotype in fetuses at 0.9 gestation. If successful, this project will open the door to understanding the molecular pathways underlying early origins of pediatric NAFLD. Our findings will be critically important for establishing next steps in the translation of PQQ as a therapeutic in MO human pregnancy and preventing transmission of NAFLD risk to the next generation."
10870847,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In a recent multi-cohort discovery study, we reported for the first time that serum levels and whole blood gene
expression of creatine kinase (CK) are decreased in childhood asthma. CK is an enzyme that – by catalyzing
the reversible reaction of creatine and ATP to phosphocreatine and ADP – plays a vital role in cellular energy
homeostasis and buffering. Further, in preliminary studies on a subset of participants with asthma from the
TCRS birth cohort we observed that, among 6-years old children with asthma, those with high circulating levels
of CK had a striking 80% reduction in their risk of persistent disease into adult life.
These results, together with those from experimental studies that we have completed, indicate that CK may
play a protective role in asthma. However, multiple elements of this association remain to be elucidated and
this R21 application will use observational data from multiple cohorts to address two critical questions. First,
although our preliminary data indicate that, among school-age children with asthma, high levels of circulating
CK may confer protection against persistence of disease, these studies are based on a single cohort, a single
CK measurement, and a small number of asthmatics and require validation in a larger consortium. Second, it
remains unknown whether, in addition to circulation, CK deficits are also present in the airways of individuals
with asthma, a question of critical importance because of the role of CK in sustaining the ciliary beat and, in
turn, enhancing the first defensive mechanism of the lungs.
This R21 application seeks to overcome these knowledge gaps through the following specific aims:
Specific aim 1: To determine whether circulating levels of CK predict persistence of childhood asthma
into adult life in multiple population-based cohorts.
Specific aim 2: To characterize and compare CK gene expression in airway epithelial cells from
individuals with and without asthma."

Administrative Core
The Center mechanism for supporting scientific research offers important benefits beyond those available from
a set of independent studies. The realization of these benefits, however, requires deliberate attention to
coordination, collaboration, and integration in all aspects of the research process. The Administrative Core
supports all domains of Center leadership, administrative support, trial metrics, and networking. The leadership
role includes all aspects of programmatic and intellectual leadership. A key feature of this role is the integration
of recommendations from the Center’s external advisory committee and review panels. The administrative
support role involves clinical trial monitoring and all Center operational management. Key tasks include budget
and personnel management, trial results reporting and dissemination, data and safety coordination, travel
coordination, and meeting organization. The trial metrics role involves the development and utilization of metrics
to evaluate clinical trial success. Metrics will be used to track trials’ output (e.g., publications, data resources),
progression through the NIH Stage Model and representation across stages; gauge the diversity of our
investigator community; and measure the number and type of collaborations. A key function is the ex-post
examination of each trial’s ex-post statistical power and lessons learned for future work. Finally, the networking
role will involve communications with Center and NBER affiliates, outreach to prospective trial investigators, and
dissemination of trial results."

Supporting the aim articulated in NIEHS’s 2018-2023 strategic plan to “recognize and seek to address the
disparate health impacts of environmental hazards on disadvantaged and diverse communities,” and the focus
of the Duke University Superfund Research Center (DUSRC) on neurodevelopmental health impacts of early-
life co-exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals, the Community Engagement Core
(CEC) will engage with low socioeconomic status communities of color in Durham and Navassa, NC,
experiencing disproportionate exposure due to geographic proximity to hazardous sites and exacerbated health
risks from exposures due to social determinants of health1–10. The CEC’s holistic, three-tiered approach to
prevention and intervention is based on the environmental health literacy framework11–14, generating awareness
of, and promoting self-efficacy to reduce early life exposure to PAHs and metals by generating solutions at
the individual, community, and policy levels. Co-produced in collaboration with our extensive network of our
community partner organizations in the two geographic areas, and in accordance with their expressed interests
and needs, the proposed CEC initiatives will facilitate bidirectional communication between affected communities
and Center researchers and trainees, other SRPs and local, state and federal agencies. The first initiative will
promote individual awareness and self-efficacy to reduce exposure among pregnant women and
children in Durham, NC, through report-back and bidirectional communication. In collaboration with
Project 1 and the Administrative and Research Translation Core (ARTC) and Data Management and Analysis
Core (DMAC), the CEC will apply best practices in risk communication and employ effective report-back and
bidirectional communication strategies to develop accessible, culturally appropriate communication tools that
promote informed decision-making and empower individual participants to take action to reduce exposures.
Secondly, the CEC will foster community level awareness of and the capacity to investigate and reduce
exposures through Environmental Health Academies, co-developed and implemented with partner
organizations in Durham and Navassa. The content of these Academies will be developed based on community
interests and concerns and in conjunction with our community partners, DUSRC researchers and trainees from
Projects 1, 4, and 5 and the Analytical Chemistry Core (ACC), DMAC, and Research Experience and Training
Coordination Core (RETCC), as well as relevant local, state, and federal agency stakeholders. Lastly, we will
build the capacity of affected communities to assess and utilize environmental health data to promote
more effective and inclusive policies aimed at reducing exposure. In conjunction with our community partner
organizations in Durham and Navassa, the CEC will collaborate with the ARTC, RETCC, and DMAC to
synthesize and report aggregate results of DUSRC research, summarize related policies and policy processes,
and facilitate participatory planning to develop community-identified policy actions that promote exposure
reduction and network with local, state, and federal policy and decision makers."

 Higher Throughput Multi-element Distributions & Quantitation at the Tissue Level
Metals are crucial for physiological processes with highly regulated trafficking, localization, and homeostasis,
where interruptions or slight variations lead to cell and tissue dysfunction and ultimately to disease. This
technology research & development (TR&D) project will advance laser ablation inductively coupled plasma
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-TOFMS) techniques to develop increased throughput imaging
capacity for metals in diverse biomedical applications. This approach will complement those being developed
in TR&Ds 2 and 3, enabling biomedical researchers to balance sensitivity, selectivity, and spatial resolution
needs to develop a wholistic understanding of the role metals play in fundamental biological processes.
Using our Driving Biomedical Projects (DBP) as test beds, this TR&D will integrate LA-ICP-TOFMS components
to develop workflows for acquiring rapid quantitative 2D multi-elemental maps derived from unique tissue types
and different sample preparation methods. Use of a cryogenic LA cell will enable analysis of cryogenically
preserved samples, ensuring tissue chemistry and structure are preserved. We will also develop standardized
approaches for producing tissue-specific LA-ICP-MS calibration standards. Our standards will be validated
using SXFM at beamline 8-BM. Once protocols for standard production and validation are developed, a set
quantity of tissue specific SXFM-validated standards will be made available to the community as universal
external LA-ICP-MS calibration standards. Finally, because metal hotspots in larger volumes can be
misrepresented or missed in 2D images, we will develop 3D imaging LA-ICP-TOFMS techniques for whole
organs and organisms. To produce 3D images we will use serial sectioning techniques facilitated by the rapid
image acquisition capabilities of the TOFMS and incorporate multi-modality image analysis software
(PyElements) being developed in TR&D 2. 3D imaging capabilities will support a wider applicability of
bioimaging techniques for the biomedical community. All of these developments will take place in the context
of our DBPs, with projects from all four themes (Metal homeostasis or dysregulation in brain function; metal
modulation in host-pathogen interactions; metal fluxes controlling reproduction and development; and metal
imbalances in metabolic pathology), supporting development of tissue-specific calibration standards and
workflows for analyzing 2D sections of different tissue types. Development of 3D LA-ICP-TOFMS imaging
technology will be most relevant to DBP Theme C (metal fluxes controlling reproduction and development).
Once mature, the cryo-LA-ICP-TOFMS will be incorporated as a service line in Northwestern’s Quantitative
Bioelement Imaging Center."

Photoacoustic Detection of Metal Fluxes at the Tissue Level
Modern optical microscopic modalities offer the following optical contrasts: optical scattering, autofluorescence
(intrinsic fluorescence), molecular probes (extrinsic fluorescence), and nonlinear optical effects. One key
contrast, optical absorption, is inaccessible by established microscopic modalities. As a result, bioelement
investigation in biological tissue mainly rely on various fluorescence probes. A lasting challenge in designing
fluorescence probes is to overcome low quantum yield, where major optical energy deposited to the probes is
dissipated via a non-radiative pathway as heat instead of as fluorescent emissions.
Measuring nonradiative thermal generation or optical absorption could offer a new way to conduct bioelement
imaging and bypass the quantum yield challenge. Imaging optical absorption quantifies ionic concentrations
with high accuracy when the molar extinction coefficient is known. Imaging optical absorption permits direct
quantitation of certain highly-optically absorbing ions (i.e. Fe in hemoglobin) and will stimulate the development
of a new class of molecular probes that focus on high extinction coefficients only, for which the struggle to
achieve high fluorescent quantum yield becomes much less critical.
In this Technology Research and Development (TR&D) project we will develop a new optical absorption
microscopy modality, referred to as optical Micro-Ring Resonator-Based Photoacoustic Microscopy or MRR-
PAM, which measures optical absorption using ultrasound. MRR-PAM detects ultrasound waves induced by
laser energy absorption and, consequently, heat generation and thermoelastic vibration. Compared with
existing photoacoustic microscopy, MRR-PAM improves the ultrasound detection bandwidth and axial
resolution by 10-fold and detection sensitivity by 100-fold. MRR-PAM provides a unique tool to enable tissue
imaging in all the DBP themes, such as the strongly scattering brain slices, thick tissue slice or whole mouse
kidney, whole zebrafish and zebrafish larvae. It will provide a new tool to quantify iron metabolism. MRR-PAM
extends the imaging capabilities developed in other TR&D projects to quantify bioelement distributions and
fluxes in both fixed and living tissue slices. It offers the possibility to image whole organs and, potentially, living
animals. The unique MRR developed in this TR&D project can be broadly disseminated and will likely impact
several other biomedical fields beyond bioelement research."
10874634,"PROJECT SUMMARY – DRIVING BIOLOGICAL PROBLEMS
Inorganic chemistry plays myriad, evolutionarily-conserved roles in physiology and pathology. Cells must
accumulate several metals, such as zinc and iron, to millimolar levels in order to survive. They can deploy
fluctuations in metal content to control processes as varied as the mammalian cell cycle, pathogen infection
and neurological function. The critical regulatory role of metals is emphasized by the observation that one-
third of all protein-encoding genes in the human genome encode metal-dependent proteins. There is an
increasing appreciation in the NIH research community that intracellular content and subcellular location of
each element provides an inorganic signature that serves as a quantitative phenotype. These realizations are
driving the demand for new technologies for quantitative evaluation of inorganic signatures in cells and
tissues. Such methods are essential to understanding the regulation of physiological and pathogenic
processes and developmental decisions. The proposed Resource will address two grand challenges. The
first is to understand how metals act within single cells to affect cell function. The second is a matter of scale:
how can we efficiently analyze millions of samples to search for correlative markers of health and disease in
the human population?
The proposed Resource for Elemental Imaging for Life Sciences (QE-Map) will develop and integrate
emerging technologies to create transformative approaches to the compelling biological question concerning
inorganic chemistry in health and disease. Neither of these challenges can be addressed with current
technology. The technologies to be developed comprise a suite of three imaging and detection methods that
will allow investigators to quantitatively map the distribution of dozens of elements in samples ranging from
cell extracts to fixed cells to tissue slices. A portfolio of twelve DBPs was selected for their capacity to enable
iterative development of new methods, and address high impact research questions in the field of “inorganic
physiology.” The DBPs focus on four themes: (a) metal regulation in brain function and pathology; (b) metal
modulation of host-pathogen interactions; (c) metal fluxes controlling reproduction and development; and (d)
metal imbalances in metabolic pathology. The External Advisory Committee will oversee the turnover of DBP
projects to maintain a portfolio is broad in scope and responsive to the needs of the national research
community while advancing and stimulating QE-Map technology development. The DBP Program Leader,
Tom O’Halloran, will deploy multiple strategies establish and strengthen collaborative relationships between
the DBP investigators and the technology development teams; including kick-off meetings, collaboration
apps, and all-Resource meetings."
10873886,"Effective treatment of infections depends on achieving adequate antibiotic concentrations at infection sites,
where the pathogen resides. However, with few exceptions, current antibiotic dosing recommendations are
based on achievable plasma concentrations, without specific information on drug concentrations at the site of
infection. However, plasma drug levels do not correlate well with those at infection sites. Cavitary lesions,
which are the hallmark of human tuberculosis (TB), have limited drug penetration and consequently are a risk
factor for treatment failure, recurrence, and the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Direct tissue measurements
are invasive, can be performed in humans only when clinically indicated, and generally provide data at a single
time-point even in animal models. Additionally, given that multiple, pathologically distinct TB lesions coexist
within the same infected-host simultaneously, measurements from one or a few easily accessible lesions are
subject to sampling bias. Finally, current antibiotic treatment strategies are designed for efficacy (e.g. >85%) at
a population level, but ignore the inter- and intra-subject heterogeneity. While shorter treatments could cure
e.g. >70%, tools to identify patients at-risk for treatment failure or requiring longer treatments are needed.
 We have developed novel tools to perform noninvasive, simultaneous and unbiased, multi-compartment in
situ measurements of antibiotic concentration-time profiles. First-in-human, whole-body dynamic 11C-rifampin
positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) were performed in newly identified
patients with rifampin-susceptible TB. PET demonstrated spatially compartmentalized rifampin exposures in
the multiple, pathologically distinct TB lesions in the same patient, with low cavitary tissue rifampin exposures.
Repeat PET/CT measurements demonstrated independent temporal evolution of rifampin exposure trajectories
in different lesions within the same patient. Similar findings were re-capitulated by PET/CT in experimentally
infected rabbits with cavitary TB and confirmed using post-mortem analyses. Integrated modeling of the PET-
captured concentration-time profiles in hollow-fiber bacterial kill-curve experiments identified that 35 mg/kg/day
of rifampin is needed to achieve cure in four months for cavitary disease. Optimized antibiotic dosing could
shorten current treatments. Conversely, suboptimal dosing is a major factor for treatment failure and antibiotic
resistance, which the World Health Organization declared as one of the top ten threats to human health.
 Our overall goals are to leverage our expertise in novel in vivo imaging tools, animal models of cavitary TB
and hollow-fiber systems to gain mechanistic insights about TB treatments: a) measure the spatial and
temporal distribution of TB drugs active against multi-drug resistant TB (bedaquiline, pretonamid, linezolid
regimen) and optimize cavitary TB treatments; b) identify the key factors contributing to treatment failure, long-
term (relapse-free) cure or able to guide treatments and; c) develop imaging (pathogen-specific or radiography-
based) biomarkers for early identification of subjects at-risk for treatment failure or requiring longer treatments."
10873887,"MECHANISMS OF KINESIN MOTOR PROTEIN INHIBITION
SUMMARY
The spatiotemporal regulation of organelle positioning is critical for proper cellular function, especially as the
cell responds to a changing environment. The kinesin superfamily of motor proteins is responsible for various
cellular processes that range from long-range axonal transport to orchestrating the mitotic spindle during cell
division. The regulation of kinesin motor proteins occurs via inhibitory and activation-based mechanisms,
where kinesin motor proteins are subject to autoinhibition when not bound to a cargo. Recently, the discovery
of kinesin-binding protein (KIFBP) revealed a novel form of kinesin inhibition whereby KIFBP binds to kinesin
motor domains to block microtubule-binding. In this grant, we will determine the molecular basis for
KIFBP-mediated kinesin inhibition in trans and how kinesin light chains in cis-lead to kinesin inhibition. Based
on structural studies of KIFBP bound to two different kinesin motor domains, we developed a model of how
KIFBP remodels kinesin motors and how KIFBP selectively engages motors. We will introduce site-specific
mutagenesis based on crosslinking mass spectrometry and patient-derived mutants to dissect kinesin binding
and remodeling by KIFBP (Aim 1). In parallel, we will determine how light chains regulate full-length kinesin
motor proteins via autoinhibition. Despite decades of work into the regulation of full-length kinesin motor
proteins, there remain conflicting results regarding inhibition of kinesin motor domains. We are poised to
answer this question by exploiting a combination of crosslinking mass spectrometry, protein engineering, and
cryo-EM to determine how kinesin light chains stabilize a compact, inhibited kinesin motor (Aim 2). We will
study both kinesin-1 heterotetramers (KIF5B:KLC1) in addition to kinesin-2 heterotrimers (KIF3A:3B:KAP) to
compare and contrast how these different kinesin motor complexes are autoinhibited. Taken together, this work
will expand our understanding of kinesin regulation, establishing modes of inhibition to provide a complete view
of kinesin activity."
10873890,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Local protein synthesis in neuronal synapses is necessary for several aspects of learning and memory,
including synaptic plasticity and consolidation of long-term memories. Studies of local protein synthesis have
long suggested that translation occurs in presynaptic areas, but presynaptic protein synthesis has only been
widely accepted by the scientific community in the last decade. As a result, virtually all studies looking at learning
and memory have focused on post-synaptic protein synthesis. However, presynaptic protein synthesis also
occurs during learning and memory across animal species, raising the question of how presynaptic protein
synthesis is regulated and how this contributes to learning and memory. Thus, our lab set out to identify
presynaptically localized transcripts and study their role in learning and memory. Subcellular sequencing of
neuronal somas and synapses in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans showed that presynaptic areas
are enriched for mRNA transcripts encoding RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Studies in mammals have shown
that RBPs are upregulated in presynapses following memory training in rats, and post-synaptic RBPs are key
regulators of post-synaptic protein synthesis. Thus, RBPs may be key regulators of presynaptic protein synthesis
during learning and memory, but further investigation is needed to test if this is the case. To this end, I propose
aims to understand how presynaptic RBPs contribute to cognitive function and memory
. I will use the nematode
worm C. elegans for the proposed experiments because it is the only organism that has a well-defined
presynaptic transcriptome, advanced genetic tools, and exhibits evolutionarily conserved memory. In Aim 1, I
will test the hypothesis that loss of conserved, presynaptically enriched RBPs will modulate learning and
memory. Specifically, I will knock down presynaptically enriched RBPs and test the effect of RNAi knockdown
on positive olfactory associative memory in C. elegans. Preliminary data suggests that these tests will reveal
presynaptic RBPs as novel memory regulators. In Aim 2, I will mechanistically study how RBPs can modulate
learning and memory by identifying the mRNAs bound by a known memory-regulating RBP, PUF-8. I will then
test the functional consequences of these mRNA targets on learning and memory. In Aim 2.1, I will perform
eCLIP-seq on PUF-8 before and after memory training to identify mRNAs that are bound by PUF-8 in a memory-
dependent manner, which are likely downstream memory-regulating genes. I will then validate my eCLIP findings
by ensuring that these mRNA targets co-localize with PUF-8 in presynapses (Aim 2.2) and have functional
consequences on learning and memory (Aim 2.3). Combined, the proposed studies will provide novel insight into
the role of presynaptic transcripts in learning and memory. More specifically, because RBPs are understudied in
terms of presynaptic translation, this proposal will address the mechanism of RBP control of downstream mRNAs
during learning and memory."

 This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Monica M. Diaz, a neurologist at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine. Dr. Diaz is establishing herself as an investigator in patient-oriented
clinical research at the intersect of brain health and HIV in Latin America. Dr. Diaz has been based at least half-
time in Peru since 2019 where she developed a mentored pilot study assessing HIV-associated neurocognitive
disorder (HAND) in older people living with HIV in Peru. The K23 award will provide Dr. Diaz with the necessary
support to develop expertise in 5 key areas: 1) Qualitative research methods and analysis, 2) clinical tool
validation in international settings, 3) neuropsychological assessments, 4) advanced biostatistical skills, 5)
implementation science frameworks and methodology. Dr. Diaz has assembled a team of core mentors (Dr.
Gwenn Garden [expert in neurocognitive disorder assessments], Dr. Victor Valcour [expert in international
assessments of HAND] and Dr. Clare Barrington [mixed-methods/qualitative research expertise in Latin America]
who will guide Dr. Diaz in achieving her training goals and career development. Supporting Dr. Diaz and her core
mentors are three collaborators: Dr. Maria Marquine (neuropsychologist with expertise in HAND in Latinos), Dr.
Michael Hudgens (biostatistician with expertise in HIV observational data) and Dr. Patricia Garcia
(implementation science expert on HIV in Peru). This multi-disciplinary mentorship team embedded within a
highly collaborative training environment is crucial for Dr. Diaz’s development into an independent investigator
with the goal of optimizing diagnostics and treatments for brain health in people with HIV in Latin America.
 HAND is a pressing issue in low-and-middle-income countries with increasing access to antiretroviral
therapy, highlighting the urgent need to optimize diagnostics and prediction of HAND for early interventions. Dr.
Diaz’s research plan outlined in this application leverages pilot data that demonstrated that nearly 30% of people
living with HIV in Lima had HAND, yet diagnostics for HAND are limited in Latin America given a lack of regional
normative data and experts in neuropsychological testing. The proposed research includes a prospective cohort
of patients with HIV and HIV-negative controls from two socioeconomically-distinct HIV clinics in Lima. The study
seeks to adapt and validate a tablet-based cognitive screening tool currently optimized for early Alzheimer’s
screening to detect HAND in Peru (Aim 1). Known modifiable risk factors for cognitive impairment, including
social determinants of health, will be used to build a predictive statistical model for HAND in Peru that can identify
intervenable factors (Aim 2). These two tools will be implemented, evaluated and optimized through iterative
rounds of interviewing with HIV care providers (Aim 3). This K23 award will provide Dr. Diaz with the mentorship
and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator to improve brain health of underserved
populations with HIV in Latin America. This proposal is a crucial step toward developing a large prospective
study identifying frequency and risk factors for HAND in Latin America as a future R01 grant."
10873670,"The proposed research is to investigate a new epigenetic mechanism for the control of metabolic
reprogramming in cancer cells. Pseudouridylation is a common epigenetic modification of human mRNA, which
is catalyzed by the family of pseudouridine synthases (PUS) that convert uridine to pseudouridine via base-
specific isomerization. The molecular and functional consequences of mRNA pseudouridylation are poorly
understood. A major barrier is the lack of suitable and robust experimental models to study the function and
regulation of mRNA pseudouridylation. We approached this problem by focusing on the PUS family of
enzymes in cancer. Our preliminary studies revealed that the expression of one of the enzymes, PUS7, is
transcriptionally upregulated by the oncogenes MYC and MYCN, which are commonly activated in various
types of human cancers. Increased expression of PUS7 promotes cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.
A key downstream target of PUS7 is ATF4, a master regulator of stress responses and cellular metabolism,
which is also targeted by MYCN in reprogramming cellular metabolism to sustain cancer cell proliferation.
PUS7 catalyzes pseudouridylation at specific sites in ATF4 mRNA and upregulates ATF4 expression. Based
on these findings, we hypothesize that PUS7 is an effector of MYC/MYCN in cancer metabolic
reprogramming by boosting ATF4 expression via ATF4 mRNA pseudouridylation. We further
hypothesize that this PUS7-ATF4 axis has a key role in the control of stress-induced metabolic
reprogramming. The proposed research will test these hypotheses. Aim 1 studies will be focused on the
biological relevance of PUS7-dependent ATF4 mRNA pseudouridylation in the model system of stress
responses. We will define the molecular mechanism by which PUS7-dependent ATF4 mRNA
pseudouridylation increases ATF4 expression (Aim 1.1). We will determine if PUS7-dependent ATF4 mRNA
pseudouridylation is regulated by stress signals and is required for stress induction of ATF4 (Aim 1.2). We will
determine if PUS7 controls stress-induced metabolic reprogramming by regulating ATF4 expression (Aim 1.3).
Aim 2 studies will be focused on the cancer relevance of PUS7-dependent ATF4 mRNA pseudouridylation
using MYC/MYCN cancer cell lines and tumor models. We will determine if PUS7 is an effector of MYC/MYCN
in metabolic reprogramming (Aim 2.1). We will determine whether PUS7-mediated ATF4 mRNA
pseudouridylation is regulated by MYC/MYCN and is an epigenetic event during MYC-driven tumor
development (Aim 2.2). We will investigate if PUS7 knockdown creates a metabolic vulnerability in
MYC/MYCN-driven tumors that could be exploited for cancer therapy (Aim 2.3). Successful completion of this
project will shed light on the biological function and cancer relevance of PUS7-dependent mRNA
pseudouridylation, which might be exploited for better cancer treatment."
10873673,"Virus particle assembly of HIV-1, the causative agent of AIDS, takes place at the plasma membrane (PM)
in most cell types including natural host T cells. This process is driven by a viral structural protein Gag. The
N-terminal matrix (MA) domain of Gag determines Gag localization to and hence virus assembly at the PM.
MA mediates membrane binding of Gag via N-terminal myristoyl moiety and a highly basic region (HBR)
that binds acidic lipids. Binding of HBR to a PM-specific acidic phospholipid PI(4,5)P2 is critical for PM
localization of Gag and efficient virus release. Notably, we and others showed that MA HBR also interacts
with tRNAs, which suppress binding of Gag to non-PI(4,5)P2 acidic lipids, suggesting tRNAs as a host
factor that regulates MA-membrane interactions. However, structural determinants for the tRNA-MA HBR
interaction and its reversal by the interaction with PI(4,5)P2, combination of which regulates PM-specific
Gag localization, remain to be examined. Binding of tRNAs to MA HBR is most likely to occur at translation
sites due to limited availability of tRNAs outside of the translation machinery. However, little is known about
subcellular sites of Gag translation, where Gag begins its movement to the PM. At the PM, Gag
multimerization and subsequent accumulation of acidic lipids are likely to promote recruitment of host
transmembrane proteins, but their effects on virus spread to uninfected cells remains to be determined in
the context of cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission.
Our long-term goal is to elucidate mechanisms that determine sites of HIV-1 assembly and to use the
knowledge for developing antiviral strategies. Our central hypothesis in this application is that MA HBR
interactions with tRNAs, which begin during translation, and with acidic lipids determine subcellular Gag
localization and the properties of progeny virions. To test this hypothesis, we plan to: 1) identify structural
determinants for interactions of MA HBR with tRNAs and acidic lipids; 2) identify tRNAs that suppress
PI(4,5)P2-independent membrane binding but allow PI(4,5)P2-mediated reversal; 3) understand the effects
of Gag translation sites on the fate of Gag; and 4) examine the effects of host transmembrane proteins
incorporated into virus particles on formation of virological synapse and virus-cell contact. The knowledge
gained from experiments outlined in this proposal will likely help us develop antiviral strategies that target
mechanisms regulating Gag localization to the PM, thereby inhibiting extracellular virus release and
spread."

Rationale: This proposal seeks NIH support for a T32 training program in Big Data Systems
Neuroscience, where students with strong backgrounds in neurobiology will receive training in
quantitative methods and experimental design. Rapid technological advances in experimental
neuroscience have enabled the collection of increasingly large neural data sets, but students in
traditional neuroscience programs rarely receive formal training in the analytical approaches
needed to understand such complex data sets. This knowledge gap slows progress and imperils
the rigor of scientific research. Bridging this knowledge gap requires collaboration between data
scientists and experimentalists, which is at the heart of this T32 training program. Carnegie
Mellon University (CMU) is a world leader and innovator in quantitative fields such as machine
learning, computer science, and artificial intelligence, and recently, neuroscience has emerged
as a field for strategic growth at the university. The training program will be housed in CMU’s
Neuroscience Institute, established in 2018 to promote interdisciplinary research and training in
big data neuroscience.
Goals: As one of the first programs of its kind, the T32 training program in Big Data Systems
neuroscience will create a unique collaborative and multi-disciplinary training experience with
three overarching goals, to:
1) provide Ph.D. students interdisciplinary, cutting-edge training in experimental and quantitative
aspects of systems neuroscience research and its responsible and ethical conduct
2) provide Ph.D. students with thoughtful, career-specific mentoring and additional professional
development opportunities to increase their retention in systems neuroscience, as well as more
broadly in the biomedical workforce
3) Provide four of the most accomplished students in later years of the program with a 24-month
fellowship to develop research projects integrating theoretical and empirical approaches
4) enhance interactions, collaborations and the overall quality of systems neuroscience
research among trainees and faculty at CMU and the University of Pittsburgh."
10873807,"Project Summary/Abstract: Chronic exposure to background noise during childhood negatively impacts
language, literacy, and cognitive development, with repercussions for children’s academic achievement and
future employment potential. A putative mechanism linking noise to decrements in language and cognitive
development is that noise disrupts young children’s ability to build a vocabulary. A robust literature
demonstrates that noise disrupts the perception of spoken words primarily through energetic masking, in
which noise limits high fidelity encoding of target speech, and informational masking, in which noise taxes
cognitive processes such as attentional control and working memory. Background noise likely disrupts word
learning through similar mechanisms. Although there have been studies testing the effects of noise on word
learning, these studies are few in number and variable in methodology. The noises in children’s naturalistic
environments vary in type (e.g., environmental noise [air conditioners] and background speech), intensity
level (i.e., how loud it is), semantic content (i.e., whether the child understands the background speech), and
spatial location: factors that exert different amounts of energetic and informational masking. Additionally,
differences in cognitive and language abilities among preschool-age children likely affect their susceptibility
to the negative effects of noise. Thus, we lack knowledge about how cognitive factors interact with variations
in noise to affect word learning in young children. This is a critical gap because spoken input is the sole source
of word learning in prereaders and an important source of word learning over the lifespan. The present study
will test the time course of novel word learning in the presence of background noise that varies in type, spatial
location, semantic content, and intensity level, which are factors that influence young children’s perception of
target speech. Specifically, the noise will vary by whether it contains speech content or not (Aim 1), whether
it is co-located or spatially separated from the target speech (Aim 2), whether it contains familiar semantic
and phonetic content versus only familiar phonetic content (Aim 3), and its intensity level (Aims 1, 3). To
accomplish these aims, a large cohort of children between 4 and 6 years of age will be trained on novel word-
referent pairs across three subsequent days. This age range is targeted because children’s speech perception
is highly susceptible to the effects of noise during this time in development, and it is an important age to build
foundational vocabulary skills. Each child will be tested in one noise condition, and the noise will be
systematically changed across conditions. Through this approach, we will determine how various noise
conditions affect both the number of words learned and the phonological precision of children’s representation
of the words throughout the learning process. This work aligns with the research priorities of the Child
Development and Behavior Branch of the NICHD as we will identify how aspects of children’s environments
affect word learning, a critical process for long-term language, cognitive, and academic outcomes."
10906252,"Although hypertension diagnosis is relatively simple and there are cheap and effective medications for lowering
blood pressure, less than 40% of patients with hypertension in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) are
aware of their diagnosis and less than 10% have good control of their blood pressure. Community health
workers (CHWs) and mobile health (mHealth) technology are increasingly being used in LMIC to fill gaps in
hypertension care, but current approaches are too dependent on physician direction. The long-term goal is to
increase the number of patients living with hypertension in LMIC who are diagnosed and effectively treated
through task sharing with CHWs equipped with mHealth technology. The overall objectives in this application
are to 1) develop a mobile application to provide advanced clinical decision support (CDS) for CHWs in
Guatemala, a middle-income country; 2) determine the accuracy of CHWs using this application in diagnosing
hypertension; and 3) determine the effectiveness of these CHWs thus-equipped in managing hypertension
compared to care provided by a physician. The central hypothesis is that CHWs using an mHealth application
and remotely supervised can diagnose and manage hypertension with similar accuracy, efficacy, and safety to
a physician. The rationale for this project is that demonstration of the efficacy of CHWs using mobile health
technology for independent hypertension diagnosis and management would have broad implications for health
service delivery in LMIC and the application and care model developed for this proposal could be easily
adapted to other settings. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Test the
accuracy of CHWs equipped with a mobile application to diagnose hypertension; 2) Assess the feasibility of
CHW-led hypertension management enabled by a mobile application; and 3) Determine the efficacy of
CHW-led hypertension management aided by a mobile application compared to physician care. Under the first
aim, CHWs using the application developed for this proposal will screen patients for hypertension and their
diagnostic accuracy compared with that of a physician. For the second aim, CHWs using the application will
manage a small group of patients with hypertension to assess intervention feasibility and continue iterative
application development. For aim three, a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial will be conducted to
compare the safety and efficacy of hypertension management by CHWs equipped with the mobile application
to physician care. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantive departure from the
status quo by enabling CHWs to independently identify and treat hypertension with asynchronous physician
supervision using a sophisticated mHealth CDS application providing guidance on titration of multiple
medications and validated through a rigorous experimental design. This project is significant because it is
expected to result in a model of care that would be widely adaptable to low-resource settings around the world,
leading to increased diagnosis and treatment of hypertension and reduced cardiovascular disease and death."

Clostridioides difficile is a Gram-positive, spore-forming and toxin-producing anaerobic bacterium. It is the most
common cause of nosocomial antibiotic-associated diarrhea and the etiologic agent of life-threatening
pseudomembranous colitis. Central to predisposition to C. difficile infection (CDI) is the disruption of the gut
microbiota by broad-spectrum antibiotics. Currently, standard treatment of CDI is the administraion of
vancomycin, fidaomicin or metronidazole, but none of these is fully effective as the antibiotic treatment results
in an estimated 15-35% of recurrence. Treatment of recurrent CDI (rCDI) is one of the major challenges in the
field. Alarmingly, significantly decreased susceptibility to metronidazole and vancomycin has been reported. As
such, metronidazole is no longer recommeded as the first-line drug for CDI treatment. Novel non-antibiotic
therapeutics that specifically target C. difficile are desperately needed to control CDI and recurrence.
We have recently identified a C. difficile phage lysin lytic domain, designated as LCD, which potently and broadly
lyse different ribotypes of C. difficile clinical isolates. We have also identified a panel of single-domain variable
fragments of heavy-chain only antibodies (VHHs) against the unique and conserved C. difficile protein Cwp84.
Cwp84 is a surface-associated cysteine protease and plays a critical role in the maturation of surface-layer
proteins that are important for bacterial colonization, as antibodies against Cwp84 protected hamsters from lethal
CDI by delaying C. difficile colonization. To generate a targeted therapy specifically against C. difficile, we have
fused LCD with one anti-Cwp84 VHH, generating a novel fusion protein LCD-VHH27. LCD-VHH27 is significantly
(p<0.0001) more potent than LCD in lysing different C. difficile strains including 2 hypervirulent epidemic RT027
strains. In this R21, we will generate more LCD-VHH fusions and use our novel antibiotic-free probiotic systems
Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactococcus lactis to deliver the fusion proteins to the site of C. difficile colonization
and infection in animal models of CDI. We hypothesize that engineered probiotics that secrete LCD-VHH fusions
at the lower intestines where C. difficile colonizes will lead to a potent therapeutic efficacy against CDI."

NYU School of Medicine, Rush University Medical Center and New York State Department of Health respond
to PA-19-056, proposing to study developmental origins of kidney function in early life and environmental risks.
The incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is steadily rising and synthetic chemicals are increasingly
understood to contribute to acute and chronic kidney injury. Case-control studies of populations with high
incidence rates have identified pesticide and herbicide exposures as risks, raising the question whether
developmental exposures may be even more impactful. Our own studies of children with CKD (R01DK100307)
have revealed modest declines in kidney function with increasing phthalate and bisphenol exposures,
accompanied by increases in oxidative stress. However, these findings do not contribute to our understanding
of the origin of CKD. A major limitation is the failure of our and other studies to account for the developmental
biology of the kidney and strong influence of perinatal/infant factors. The premise of the present proposal is
that intrauterine inflammatory processes disrupt nephrogenesis and that environmental chemicals also impair
renal parenchymal growth longitudinally during gestation and postnatal development via oxidant stress. We
further interrogate this hypothesis by examining phthalates, bisphenols, glyphosate and organophosphate (OP)
pesticides as modifiable risks. We will test these hypotheses in the New York University Children's Health and
Environment Study, one of the participating cohorts in the NIH Environmental Influences and Child Health
Outcomes Program (UH3OD023305). The proposed work builds upon our experience with postnatal renal
sonographic measurement, which we will add prospectively to the existing, funded follow up. The approach is
cost-efficient, leveraging existing measures for three exposure categories in pregnancy and infancy and
available biospecimens to measure soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, an emerging
marker of kidney injury and development, and glyphosate. The MPIs (Trasande and Trachtman) are highly
complementary, coupling experts in children's environmental health with nephrology who have a track record
of productive MPI partnership in R01DK100307, which produced preliminary data in support of the proposed
work. Analyses will be performed by K. Kannan at Wadsworth Laboratories of the New York State Department
of Health, who has deep experience with precise measurement of glyphosate and metabolites in urine. In
contrast to many known CKD risks which are not amenable to modification or avoidance, pesticides and
herbicides can be reduced by consuming organic foods while phthalates and bisphenols can be reduced by
avoiding canned and processed foods. The proposed work has the potential to shift the paradigm of origins of
CKD to focus needed attention on its developmental origins."
10878945,"Project Summary
Despite considerable research over the past 30 years, there is still no established effective treatment to
improve recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). In part, this reflects incomplete understanding of the
complex secondary pathobiological mechanisms involved. The aim of our research is to understand the cellular
and molecular mechanisms responsible for post-injury neuroinflammation in order to allow future development
of novel therapies. The voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 is a newly discovered ion channel, highly expressed
in resting microglia of the brain. Under pathological conditions, microglial Hv1 is required for NADPH oxidase
(NOX)-dependent generation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) by providing charge compensation for
exported electrons and relieving intracellular acidosis. Thus, Hv1 is a unique target for controlling multiple NOX
activities and ROS production. However, neither the precise signaling mechanisms underlying this finding nor
critical role of Hv1 in the pathophysiology of SCI are fully understood. Based on our preliminary data, we will
test the hypothesis that microglial Hv1 functions as a key mechanism in neuroinflammation, through altered
NOX2/ROS/IFN- signaling that modulates microglia-astrocyte interaction, thus affecting long-term
neurological outcomes after SCI.
 We will use systemic or microglial Hv1 KO, microglial NOX2 KO transgenic mice and in vivo and in vitro
innovatively technologies to determine the mechanisms of SCI-triggered Hv1 elevation on post-injury
neuroinflammation. Aim 1 will determine the function and mechanisms of the Hv1 in neuroinflammation
after SCI. Multiple quantitative assessments of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation will be combined with
genetic or pharmacological intervention targeting Hv1 to test the hypothesis that SCI-induced microglial Hv1
activation mediates detrimental neuroinflammation and functional deficits through altered microglial
NOX2/ROS signaling. Aim 2 will elucidate the role of microglial NOX2 in post-injury neuroinflammation.
We will utilize genetic intervention to delete Hv1-dependent up-regulation of NOX2 in microglia, and evaluate
the effects on microglial NOX2 coupling to Hv1 on neuroinflammation after SCI. Aim 3 will identify critical
role of Hv1/NOX2-derived ROS/IFN- in SCI-chronic neuroinflammation through microglia-astrocyte
interaction. Complimentary cellular, molecular, and genetic approaches will be used to test the hypothesis
that Hv1/NOX2-mediated microglial ROS activates pro-inflammatory astrocytes resulting in secreting IFN that
in turn reinforces microglial inflammation, thus contributes to astrocytes dysfunction and neuronal damage.
 Our study will be the first to implicate microglial Hv1/NOX2/ROS/IFN- signaling in the pathophysiology
of SCI, leading to novel treatment approaches for SCI. Given the proposed roles for Hv1 in other inflammatory
models, Hv1 signaling represents a generic mechanism relevant to other neuroinflammatory states."

Delirium is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by acute and fluctuating changes in cognition
and consciousness. Delirium survivors suffer from a cluster of cognitive, physical, and psychological
disabilities. These disabilities lead to high healthcare utilization, lower quality of life, and loss of functional
independence. Worse, a single episode of delirium increases the risk of Alzheimer disease and related
dementias. Based on work from our group and the work of others, over 25% of patients who undergo
emergency intra-abdominal surgery suffer from at least one episode of delirium during the index
hospitalization, putting them at high risk for cognitive decline. There is a fundamental gap in knowledge
regarding the best way to prevent cognitive, psychological and functional decline in patients who undergo
emergency general surgery and subsequently develop delirium. The long-term goal of this line of research is
to improve the health and quality of care for older emergency general surgery survivors. The objective of this
application is to apply the concepts of collaborative care to a high-risk patient population. Indiana University
School of Medicine and University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health researchers have over
20 years of experience developing innovative and effective collaborative care models that integrate with
primary care and specialty physicians to address the complex biopsychosocial needs of patients with chronic
disease states, such as dementia and depression. Our team has developed a specific collaborative care model
called the Emergency General Surgery Delirium Recovery Program. This proposal aims to conduct a
randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of 12-months of collaborative care in improving the
cognitive, functional and psychological recovery of emergency intra-abdominal surgery patients who suffer at
least one episode of delirium in the post-operative period and are at least 65 years old. The trial has the
following specific aims: 1) Evaluate the ability of the Emergency General Surgery Delirium Recovery Model to
improve the cognitive recovery of older Emergency General Surgery delirium survivors; and 2) Evaluate the
ability of the Emergency General Surgery Delirium Recovery Model to improve the physical recovery of older
Emergency General Surgery delirium survivors; and 3) Evaluate the ability of the Emergency General Surgery
Delirium Recovery Model to improve the psychological recovery of older Emergency General Surgery delirium
survivors. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it represents a new and substantive
departure from the status quo. Previous collaborative care models focused on chronic care management and
they lack rapid adaptability. We have also adapted the intervention to be completed solely via telehealth. This
contribution will be significant as broad application of the Emergency General Surgery Delirium Recovery
Program at hospitals across the country could result in better health and improved quality of care for a
particularly vulnerable patient population."
10879055,"In this competing renewal of the Postdoctoral Training Program at the Forsyth, we are excited to propose the
expansion of our program to include the DMD/PhD program at our long-time affiliate, Harvard School of Dental
Medicine (HSDM). The underlying rationale is to build on the strengths of our current separate training programs
that focus on the development of research-focus dentist scientists and oral health researchers and to broaden
the scope to include both predoctoral and postdoctoral applicants for academic careers in the NIH funding
environment. This application seeks to integrate valuable and synergistic features to enhance the pipeline of
dentist scientists and oral health researchers. We will build on the strength of our NIH-sponsored T90/R90
postdoctoral training program to develop a diverse group of committed, highly trained and competitive
investigators who seek to obtain collaborative, multidisciplinary research training (basic, translational, or clinical)
applicable to oral and craniofacial diseases, conditions and disorders that will take advantage of the most current
scientific and collaborative strategies. Collaborative and multidisciplinary research is emphasized, in part, by
recruiting trainees into collaborative investigations within or between broadly focused researchers at Forsyth and
HSDM. The program is guided by an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), led by Dr. Thomas Van Dyke (Program
Director), Dr. Yingzi Yang (Co-Director) and Dr. Xuesong He (Assistant Director). Expert biannual program
review is provided by an External Advisory Committee of Drs. Jane Weintraub (University of North Carolina),
Jeffrey Ebersole (University of Nevada, Las Vegas) and Charles Serhan (Harvard Medical School). The program
provides support for six trainees per year; 4 postdoctoral and 2 DMD/PhD. Trainees will take required
courses/workshops including Responsible Conduct of Research, Methods for Enhancing Reproducibility,
Elements of Grant Writing, Grant Review and Support, Maximizing the Mentor-Mentee Relationship, and
Effectively Communicating Research. Additional elective and non-elective opportunities will be tailored to the
individual's needs and programs. Tutorials and seminars in grantsmanship, grant writing skills, and successful
teaching and presentation are each part of trainees’ programs. There are also opportunities for mentoring high
school student summer research which not only provides trainees with valuable mentoring experience, but also
enriches the pipeline for those selecting research-intensive health-related careers in the future. Trainees’
progress is reviewed weekly by the mentor and semiannually by program staff for reappointment and guidance.
An IAC member is assigned to each trainee for guidance and assistance in grant preparation/review. All
postdoctoral trainees are required to prepare and submit a K or R grant application and DMD/PhD’s are
encouraged to submit F31 applications. Provision is made for informal and formal trainee feedback (current and
post-program) and for trainee tracking following completion of the program."
10884427,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although the genome is a blueprint for making an organism, the epigenome (modification on the
genome without DNA sequence change) governs the functional outcome of genes and ultimately
shapes the organism. Epigenetic modification is a conserved and important gene regulatory mechanism
and plays quintessential roles in genome integrity, development, environmental responses, and
diseases. Despite the large number of correlative studies describing the altered modification patterns
in abnormal developmental and pathological tissues, whether they are a cause or a consequence is
poorly understood. This proposal dissects the molecular mechanism of epigenetic regulation and
functional consequences of epigenome perturbation under developmental and physiological conditions.
Specifically, we investigate i) how epigenome reprogramming in response to environmental cues might
lead to stress adaptation; ii) how an epigenetic switch regulates developmental phase transition; and
iii) how epigenetic modification safeguards the genome integrity. We will further dissect the causal roles
of epigenetic marks on gene expression and develop an innovative CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cis-
engineering system for epigenome editing. Our approach is highly interdisciplinary making use of the
powerful Arabidopsis genetic system, high-throughput proteomics and genomics, live-cell imaging
techniques, biochemical and structural tools to tackle mechanistic problems from genome-wide scale
to atomic resolution. As we probe basic principles governing epigenetic regulation that are conserved
across eukaryotes, the mechanistic knowledge and epigenome technologies acquired from our
pioneering Arabidopsis studies will help accelerate progress in deciphering the relevant mechanisms in
human. Such knowledge will lead to the development of innovative tools to correct aberrant epigenetic
modifications and ultimately enable new applications for medicine and human health."

Multiple acquired and genetic conditions can lead to pathological left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). It has been
recognized for over 50 years that pathological LVH is associated with increased mortality in the human
population, and it is strongly associated with both heart failure with preserved systolic function (HFpEF) and
heart failure with reduced systolic function (HFrEF). At the tissue level, the primary cause of LVH is
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and there are a multitude of intracellular signaling pathways involved in
hypertrophic cardiomyocyte growth. However, non-cardiomyocyte cell populations also contribute to
pathological ventricular remodeling in LVH and the downstream sequelae of this disease. Therefore, it is
critical to understand not only the primary causes of pathological cardiomyocyte growth but also how the
myocardial microenvironment responds to these changes. To uncover mechanisms regulating pathological LV
remodeling, we utilize multiple murine models that harbor sarcomere gene mutations which are common
genetic causes of LVH in humans. Previously, we discovered that loss of the sarcomere protein MYBPC3
causes rapid changes in early post-natal cardiomyocyte growth through dysregulated cell cycle pathways
causing cardiomyocyte endoreplication (DNA replication without cell division). Next, we found that
dysregulated cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity leads to replication stress induced DNA damage and activation
of DNA damage response (DDR) pathways in cardiomyocytes. We have now discovered that the DDR effector
protein, murine double mutant 2 (MDM2), plays an important role in regulating pathological LV remodeling in
both genetic and pressure overload LVH models. We hypothesize that the MDM2-HIF signaling axis is a key
regulator of pathological ventricular remodeling in genetic and acquired forms of myocardial hypertrophy. To
test this hypothesis, we will pursue the following aims: Aim 1: Define how MDM2-HIF signaling regulates
microvasculature dysfunction and LV remodeling in genetic models of LVH. Aim 2: Determine how MDM2-HIF
signaling regulates myocardial metabolism in genetic models of LVH. Aim 3: Define how cardiomyocyte
MDM2-HIF signaling regulates pathological LV remodeling secondary to pressure overload in the adult heart.
At the conclusion of these innovative and high impact studies, we will have defined a novel role for MDM2-HIF
signaling during key stages of pathological left ventricular remodeling in both genetic and acquired causes.
Through selective modulation of key components of this pathway our goal is to disrupt maladaptive myocardial
remodeling responses and uncover novel therapeutic opportunities for both genetic and non-genetic forms of
human cardiomyopathy."
10882887,"Abstract
Background: Care fragmentation is a major challenge for older adults living with Alzheimer's Disease and
Related Dementias (ADRD) and multimorbidity. Those in this population who are adversely affected by social
determinants of health (SDoH) are particularly vulnerable to the negative outcomes associated with care
fragmentation due to complex care needs, cognitive impairments, and social barriers. Care fragmentation is
associated with medical errors, poor patient experience, billions of dollars in wasteful healthcare spending, and
increased mortality. Although care coordination can mitigate care fragmentation and reduce social barriers
associated with disparities in health outcomes, it demands collective efforts and interdependent relationships
by clinicians across care teams and sites. Care coordination research has primarily focused on care tasks or
components and standardized tools. The complex, dynamic, and interdependent relationships among clinicians
through which care is delivered and coordinated have not been sufficiently evaluated.
Approach: Based on my previous work, I propose that this gap be addressed using social network analysis
(SNA) and electronic health record (EHR) data. Use of SNA and EHR data may better evaluate system- and
patient-level clinician networks across settings and over time (during K99) and explicate how clinician networks
relate to patients' social context and health outcomes (during R00) for older adults with ADRD and
multimorbidity. Specific Aim 1 will map the system-level clinician network for a cohort of over 90,000 older
adults with multimorbidity, including ADRD, using a combination of structured and unstructured EHR data.
Specific Aim 2 will detect and describe patient-level clinician networks for older adults with ADRD and identify
characteristics of weak networks that could be associated with fragmented care. Specific Aim 3 will identify
relational processes that are influenced by SDoH and contribute to disparities in health outcomes for older
adults with ADRD. I hypothesize that patients more adversely affected by individual- and community-level
SDoH are more likely to be cared for by clinicians in peripheral system positions, fragmented network
structures, or networks weakening over time, and that having peripheral, fragmented, or weakening clinician
networks will be associated with higher costs and risks for hospitalization and mortality.
Mentoring and Training Plan: I will work with a highly interdisciplinary mentorship team of experts in data
science, complex systems, health disparities, bioinformatics, health services and outcomes, computational
social science, stakeholder engagement, primary care, ADRD, and aging research. My mentorship team will
guide my training to gain competencies in longitudinal SNA and natural language processing during the K99.
This K99/R00 award is vital for continuing my progress in achieving my career goal of establishing an
independent, transdisciplinary research program to improve care coordination, thereby enhancing healthcare
quality and equity for older adults with multimorbidity, particularly those living with ADRD."
10884149,"The fungus Candida albicans is the 4th most common cause of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections
(BSI), and is a major cause of intravenous catheter-associated infections, urinary infections, skin and mucosal
infections, and invasive disease in our veteran patient population. Despite advancements in medical care, the
high mortality rate due to invasive Candida infections is no better than two decades ago. Thus, our ability to
prevent, diagnose, and treat invasive Candida infections is still in need of great improvement. Although C.
albicans is a normal human colonizer, it has the ability to cause disease through various specialized attributes.
These virulence-associated factors include secretion of degradative enzymes that assist in tissue invasion,
formation of elongated hyphal structures in a process termed filamentation, and establishment of complex
structures called biofilms, which protect this fungus from antimicrobial drugs and host immune defenses.
 In previous studies, we examined the role of the pre-vacuolar secretory pathway in the secretion of
virulence-associated proteins and biofilm formation in C. albicans, regulated by the vacuolar protein secretion
genes VPS1, VPS4, and PEP12. We demonstrated that this pre-vacuolar secretory pathway contributes to
secretion of a key degradative enzyme, secreted aspartyl protease, and is involved in aspects of filamentation,
biofilm formation, and virulence. For example, we discovered that the C. albicans pep12 null mutant formed a
biofilm that dramatically fragmented with minimal disturbance, and was defective in virulence in vivo.
Expanding upon these studies, we next studied the late stages of secretion by examining key final steps in
exocytosis regulated by the exocyst protein complex. In this work, we demonstrated that the exocyst-related
SNARE proteins Sso2p and Sec9p were essential for viability in C. albicans, and were required for the
secretion of aspartyl proteases and lipases, and hyphal formation. In contrast, several major components of
the exocyst complex, including Exo70p and Exo84p, and the regulatory protein Sro77p did not appear to be
required for filamentation.
 Next, we have begun studies of another essential component of the secretory pathway, that is, endocytosis
and the endocytic pathway. This highly regulated, sequential pathway is involved in intake of extracellular
materials and recycling of plasma membrane proteins and other components of the secretory pathway. Our
main objective is to determine the role of endocytosis in secretion, filamentation, biofilm formation, and
virulence. Further, we will study the specific contributions of endocytosis to filamentation from a mechanistic
standpoint. This project will therefore examine the key hypotheses that: (i) specific genes in key steps of
endocytosis are required for filamentation and biofilm formation, (ii) mutations in endocytosis pathway genes at
key steps will result in attenuated virulence in vitro and in vivo, and (iii) C. albicans has novel genes and
pathways that are involved in endocytosis.
 We will first study the specific functions of C. albicans END3, SYP1, PAL1, ENT1, and YAP1801, which are
predicted to be involved in key early steps in endocytosis. We will also study RHO1 to determine if there is a
novel route of endocytosis that exists in C. albicans, as described in Saccharomyces. Next, we will study a set
of eight novel genes lacking human or Saccharomyces counterparts, involved in endocytosis or secretion,
which we identified using a computational/comparative genomics approach. Then we will seek to identify novel
genes involved in endocytosis by screening several C. albicans mutant library collections. All of these studies
will be accomplished using genetic, biochemical, molecular and cell biology approaches.
 Expected Results: We expect to determine the functional role of specific genes related to key stages of
endocytosis in in C. albicans, and define their link to filamentation and virulence in order to understand
molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis and identify novel drug targets for further intervention."

The animal studies in this renewal application will parallel the clinical trial studies to further understand the
mechanisms of somatic reinnervation for restoration of bladder emptying function.
Aim 1: Address the following questions:
 • Will administration of growth factors into the reinnervated urinary bladder wall improve recovery?
 • Which are the most effective growth factors to use? Will it be:
 a) Factors produced by the decentralized bladder cells (smooth muscle, intramural ganglia, interstitial,
 urothelial cells),
 b) Factors that promote neonatal survival of bladder spinal motoneurons; or,
 c) Factors that optimally attract the somatic motor fibers from the donor obturator nerve?
 • What growth factors promote functionally optimal afferent reinnervation?
Aim 2: Address the following questions:
 • Is the one anterior vesical branch of the pelvic nerve on each side that is reinnervated by a portion of the
 obturator nerve branch sufficient to achieve effective bladder emptying and sensation?
 • Is the loss of innervation from transecting vesical branches alone enough to result in loss of bladder
 function or this there sufficiently retained innervation through other branches such that the voiding function
 recovers with time?
 • Is the recovery of voiding behavior truly the result of the new neural pathway from the nerve transfer or
 some other spontaneous recovery?
 • Will obturator to anterior branch of the pelvic nerve transfer performed before decentralization improve
 recovery of bladder function?
Aim 3: Answer the following questions using the canine tissue bank accrued from the previous funding cycles
and from the new animals in these proposed studies:
 • What properties have changed in the axotomized motor nerves and how are these altered by rerouting?
 • What types of efferent fibers are reinnervating the bladder from the obturator nerve and on what type of
 cells do these new fibers terminate?
 • Do the new bladder efferent fibers originate from the ventral horn, sympathetic chain ganglia or both?
 • What types of afferent fibers are growing into the bladder from the obturator nerve and what are their en-
 organ targets? Is it urothelium, intramural ganglia, muscles, or blood vessels?"

American Indian communities have been greatly affected by the opioid epidemic with many Tribes being
overwhelmed by opioid use and overdose. Among all racial/ethnic groups in the U.S., American Indians and
Alaska Natives have the highest rate of overdose fatalities from all opioids. Within Southern California, areas
encompassing American Indian Tribes have experienced some of the highest age-adjusted rates of opioid
overdose deaths. In March 2023, the Harm Reduction Coalition of San Diego (HRCSD) formed strategic
partnerships with Southern California Tribes to install overdose prevention vending machines (ODPVM) that
freely dispense naloxone, with the goal of reducing opioid-related overdose deaths on tribal reservations. To
our knowledge, these are the first ODPVM to be established on Tribal Sovereign Land in the U.S. With the
current or soon-to-be placement of ODPVMs on several tribal reservations, our research team, led by two
American Indian Principal Investigators, is in a unique position to conduct timely applied research that is
responsive to tribal leadership's call for community-based prevention activities aimed at reducing overdose
deaths. Through a collaborative community-based and participatory research (CBPR) approach we will
conduct a bi-phasic, milestone-driven R61/R33 study over a 3-year period. Our study will focus on the
implementation process of ODPVM on tribal lands using the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness,
Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance), with a focus on health equity. During year 1, the exploratory R61
phase, the study will be guided by the following specific aims: 1. develop the CBPR infrastructure by identifying
and working with tribal and community representatives who will aid in the development of a culturally
appropriate study design to examine the implementation of ODPVM on tribal lands and 2. identify the initial
reach of ODPVM during the first year of vending machine placement. During years 2-3, the developmental R33
Phase, our specific aims will address the following: 3. describe the implementation process and identify
implementation strategies to increase utilization of ODPVMs within tribal reservations and 4. compare the
impact of ODPVMs by examining the statistical and spatial distribution of fatal overdose rates on tribal
reservations vs San Diego County, California. Opportunities to evaluate harm reduction strategies on tribal

 For patients with hematologic malignancies such as leukemias, lymphomas and other related cancers,
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo HCT) is a critically important therapy that can produce cures
when other treatments cannot. Roughly 20,000 patients undergo allo BMT world-wide each year. A major risk
of allo HCT continues to be graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which results from the donor immune system
recognizing the transplant recipient’s organs as foreign, leading to life-threatening inflammation. Developing
strategies that reduce GVHD but leave global immune function intact should produce a major benefit for
patients. One promising approach that we propose testing is targeting the subset of intestinal commensal
bacteria that are capable of consuming and degrading mucins, which play a critical role in maintaining the
intestinal epithelial barrier and immunological homeostasis.
 In this proposal, we present preliminary data identifying two common scenarios during the allo HCT
process: 1) poor oral dietary intake due to conditioning or development of GVHD, and 2) administration of
broad-spectrum antibiotics. Both of these often lead to increases in mucolytic bacteria. Further, we have
identified antibiotic and metabolic strategies to suppress mucolytic bacteria activity. We will apply these
insights to guide a mucus-focused evaluation of GVHD, in both mouse models and in stool biospecimens
collected from allo HCT patients.
 We and others have identified the microbiota as a potent modulator of acute GVHD severity. This
project proposes capitalizing on a mechanistic insight into how this can occur, with clear translational potential."
10881152,"The glycans present on IgG antibodies are key determinants of immune complex (IC) signaling by FcγRs, with
modulations in IgG glycosylation triggering distinct antibody effector functions in response to infection or
immunization. While FcγR signaling pathways are broadly characterized, with established functions in cell
maturation, phagocytosis, production or release of soluble factors, and suppression or modulation of activating
signals, little is known about how these responses are integrated at the tissue level. Of particular interest is
understanding how IgG glycoforms regulate antibody-mediated functions in the lung, the immune interface for
respiratory pathogens and a tissue with unique cellular features, including lung-specific, FcγR-expressing cells.
Using a newly developed system in mice that express human FcγRs, we have found that IC glycosylation,
specifically fucosylation and sialylation, can regulate lung inflammatory responses. We now propose to examine
the role of distinct IgG IC glycoforms in regulating the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV virus infections, as we
have observed that different patterns of IC glycosylation correlate with disease risk in these two infections. We
will study how signaling by differentially glycoslylated IC impacts viral and host immune readouts in SARS-CoV-
2 and IAV virus infections, and we will define molecular mechanisms governing the regulation of lung
inflammation by IC. Our hope is that these studies will reveal aspects of how the host IgG glycome contributes
to heterogeneous outcomes of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and IAV viruses and reveal mechanisms that can be
targeted to prevent the severe lung inflammation that leads to ARDS and mortality in these and potentially other
respiratory infections."

The application of machine learning (ML) to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) represents a novel avenue for
developing tools to enhance precision cardiovascular care. ML-based predictive approaches can learn response
profiles based on the clinical characteristics of patients included in RCTs, thereby allowing personalized
inference. However, despite the development of promising algorithms from applying these novel methods to
high-quality experimental data in RCTs, there is a lack of a clear pathway for their real-world evaluation and
implementation. To bridge this gap, we aim to develop an implementation-aligned strategy for care
personalization models. We achieve this through our three study aims. In Aim 1, we will empirically evaluate
various ML approaches for RCT using adequately powered simulated heterogeneous treatment effects,
specifically incorporating covariate distributions observed in real-world patients from two distinct and diverse
health systems. Using participant-level data from five diverse NIH-funded RCT datasets, we will evaluate models
based on their performance in detecting simulated graded positive control heterogeneous treatments effects in
these RCTs as well as in “digital twins” of these RCTs, computationally designed to replicate populations of these
conditions in the practice in electronic health records (EHRs). Such an approach is needed to evaluate model
generalizability to different populations expected in EHRs. In Aim 2, we enhance the interoperability between
RCTs and EHRs, which is required for translating RCT-derived models to EHRs as well as selecting candidate
predictors based on their EHR availability. We will accomplish this by mapping covariates from RCTs to a
common data model, using a novel sentence transformer to map the descriptions of these covariates to those in
the common data model. We will demonstrate real-world RCT covariate distribution at 13 hospitals across two
health system EHRs mapped to the same common data model. In Aim 3, we will address the informative
missingness of covariates in the real-world data, representing another key challenge limiting the pragmatic
evaluation of algorithms developed from RCTs. For this, we will prospectively evaluate novel approaches that
adapt models for variable missingness, both random and informative, during the model development process. In
this study, we will assess whether “missingness-adapted algorithms” accurately capture the personalized effect
estimates for patients, compared with a complete-covariate algorithm whose covariates are captured
prospectively through direct patient contact. Collectively, the proposal will develop an end-to-end strategy for
evaluating models developed from RCTs to improve their selection for real-world, pragmatic evaluation and
implementation in EHRs. The methods will be rigorously tested in multiple RCTs. Moreover, through open-source
data sharing, the datasets and the results of our work will be available as benchmarks for the rigorous
development of further methodology for detecting personalized effects from RCTs. The proposal will serve as an
essential framework for evaluating and translating precision care tools developed from RCTs."
10883339,"Pineoblastoma (PB) is an understudied, clinically aggressive embryonal tumor of the pineal gland diagnosed
early in life. Due to its rarity, knowledge pertaining to the molecular and cellular basis of PB has remained modest.
Likewise, preclinical models of PB are extremely scarce, stalling efforts to discover and credential curative
therapies that reduce collateral damage to the developing central nervous system. To overcome the primitive
understanding of PB tumor biology and identify clinically relevant molecular heterogeneity, we recently performed
bulk genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional profiling on a sizable cohort of primary patient tumor samples,
defining four distinct subgroups: PB-RB1, PB-MYC/FOXR2, PB-miRNA1, and PB-miRNA2. Namesake PB-RB1
and PB-MYC/FOXR2 subgroups represent the primary diagnoses of PB during infancy and account for an
unacceptably high mortality rate. Loss-of-function mutations targeting miRNA processing genes define the
clinically heterogeneous PB-miRNA1 and PB-miRNA2 subgroups diagnosed in children and adolescents. An
international consensus on the definition of these novel PB subgroups was included in the most recent update
to the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System and has
begun to change how PB is diagnosed clinically. In this research program, we aim to advance understanding of
biologically and clinically distinct PB subgroups through deep investigation of their cellular, developmental, and
pathological basis. We hypothesize that molecular subgroups of PB exhibit divergent cellular programs and
originate from discrete progenitor states during pineal gland development. Disclosing cellular hierarchies and
developmental origins of novel PB subgroups will (i) resolve oncogenic mechanisms; (ii) inform preclinical
modeling strategies; (iii) implicate candidate dependencies; and (iv) enable evaluation of novel therapeutic
strategies. This hypothesis will be tested in two conceptually and technically innovative Specific Aims that
integrate a multidisciplinary and multispecies approach. In Aim #1, we will leverage a large single-nucleus
transcriptome dataset generated from molecularly annotated PB patient tumors to discover cellular programs
driving malignancy. In addition, we will utilize first-in-class atlases of the developing mouse and human pineal
gland to define subgroup-specific cellular origins and reveal tumor-enriched molecular signatures, collectively
informing pathogenic mechanisms and candidate therapeutic vulnerabilities. In Aim #2, we will deliver a series
of novel, genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models representative of distinct PB subgroups, including
comprehensive phenotypic and molecular characterization. Novel GEM models will validate suspected PB driver
genes and serve as essential preclinical models for testing innovative treatment strategies targeting prominent
cell identity programs. Successful execution of this research program will overcome essential knowledge gaps
pertinent to biological and clinical heterogeneity in PB and provide a platform for the pursuit of more specific,
less toxic treatment options for affected patients."

 Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the U.S. and their treatment
uses a substantial proportion of healthcare resources. Of the GI cancers, colorectal cancer (CRC) and
esophageal cancer (EAC) account for a majority of the cancer related deaths, and both are preventable by
screening and surveillance. The current screening tests are suboptimal and have variable success.
 A major goal of CRC screening tests is to identify advanced tubular and serrated adenomas, which are
high-risk for becoming CRC, as well as early stage CRC. The risk for CRC is variable with some people being
at high risk because of family histories of CRC, hereditary cancer syndromes, or a personal history of adenomas.
High risk people are placed on aggressive colonoscopy based surveillance programs and low-risk people are
placed on minimal surveillance programs. Unfortunately, our current system for identifying high and low CRC
risk is suboptimal resulting in under and over surveillance and preventable interval CRCs. Better risk markers
for CRC to are needed to prevent interval CRCs and improve the overall effectiveness of CRC screening.
 Analogous to CRC, EAC arises from a precancerous condition of the esophagus called Barretts
esophagus (BE), which is a specialized intestinal metaplasia of the esophagus and the highest risk factor for
EAC. It is present in 5% of the US population. BE progresses to EAC through successive histologic steps of
low grade dysplasia (LGD), high grade dysplasia (HGD) and then EAC. Screening and surveillance for BE is
recommended using serial upper endoscopy, which is controversial in its effectiveness for preventing deaths
from EAC. This is in part because, as with CRC, BE patients have variable risk of EAC and are placed on high-
risk and low-risk screening programs. However, the current system for assigning risk is not accurate and the
current screening test is expensive. More cost effective and accurate EAC and HGD screening/surveillance
assays and accurate BE risk biomarkers are needed.
 We propose to develop an EDRN BCC that is integrated into the EDRN consortium and, through
collaborations within and outside the EDRN, will develop effective GI cancer screening biomarkers. We propose
to identify, validate, and develop accurate CLIA compliant risk biomarkers for CRC and for EAC in order to
prevent EAC and CRC missed under current screening protocols. Moreover, the accurate risk stratification of
patients for CRC and EAC will reduce the financial impact of current CRC and EAC prevention programs. We
also propose to identify and validate accurate CLIA compliant early detection markers for HGD and early stage
EAC that can be used in an inexpensive, non-endoscopic surveillance test."

This application represents the fourth competitive renewal for our T32 program “Training in HIV
Pathogenesis”. To reflect the vibrant development of our program, in step with NIH HIV/AIDS
research priorities as articulated in NOT-OD-15-137, we have renamed our program “Training in
HIV Pathogenesis, Vaccination, and Cure”. The program supports 6 predoctoral and 3
postdoctoral trainees per year. The program is based at the Perelman School of Medicine at the
University of Pennsylvania, the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine,
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the Wistar Institute, which occupy a single, contiguous
campus in Philadelphia. Together, these institutions have one of the largest HIV/AIDS research
programs in the country, with a funding base of $49.5 million as determined by the NIH Office of
AIDS Research. Closely associated with our training program is our Center for AIDS Research
(CFAR) which was renewed in 2018 (i.e. $2.6 million annually), thereby supporting numerous
programs that benefit our trainees. Our program provides robust and innovate training in HIV
research, while integrating key concepts from numerous other disciplines. Appointments are for
1-3 years. Over the last 15 years, the program has supported 52 predoctoral students who
worked in 22 different laboratories and 27 postdoctoral trainees who have worked in 15
laboratories. Of these, 91% of graduate students and 91% of postdoctoral fellows are continuing
in research or research-related careers. Among the many individuals who study HIV/AIDS on
our campus, a select group of 24 mentors are associated with this T32 program. Excitingly, we
have added five new mentors in training (four assistant professors and one associate
professor), providing robust growth and new directions for years to come. In our program, we
place special emphasis on collaborative science and a commitment to training students and
postdoctoral fellows. The cohesive nature of our training program is demonstrated by the fact
that 22 of our 24 trainers have published papers with other trainers, and 69% of our trainees
over the last 10 years have published with two or more trainers. We are particularly pleased that
of our Diversity Trainees supported in the last 10 years (five predocs and three postdocs), all
are still in Research Related or Research Intensive careers. Based on these outcomes we feel
we are training young scientists effectively, and so propose to maintain the training program at
its present size."

Exposures to extreme events are increasingly common in many parts of the globe as a function of changes in
weather patterns combined with rising sea levels, but there is a paucity of data to support scientific research on
the implications of such exposures for population health and well-being over the long-term. STAR, the Study of
the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, is a unique exception. We have interviewed respondents from 10
months before the December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami for 10 years. This project will follow
up the same respondents 15 years after the tsunami. The pre-tsunami baseline is a population-representative
survey of 27,000 individuals who were living along the coast of Aceh and North Sumatra, Indonesia. The
tsunami constitutes a large-scale, unanticipated natural disaster in an area that was not thought to be prone to
tsunamis. Moreover, its impacts were spatially idiosyncratic across the study area. Whether a particular
community was inundated by the waves depended on a combination of the wave direction, seabed and
shoreline topography. Of 368 baseline communities, about a fifth were devastated, a third were somewhat
damaged and the rest were not directly affected. These features of the natural experiment provide the basis for
identifying causal impacts of this major natural disaster which killed 170,000 people in the study area.
The baseline and six post-tsunami waves collected during the prior phase of this project provide detailed
information about exposure to and experience of the disaster and the evolution of health and wellbeing,
broadly defined, for baseline respondents who survived the tsunami plus new household members. In each
follow-up, we have interviewed 95% of all baseline survivors. In this continuation we will re-interview all
baseline survivors and their household members fifteen years after the tsunami. We will place these data in the
public domain, adding to prior waves of STAR already in the public domain to create an unparalleled data
resource for the scientific community.
Focusing on those who were exposed to the tsunami as children (age <12y and in utero at the time), we will
investigate the impacts of tsunami exposure on the evolution of health, education and cognitive performance,
linking outcomes to changes in material and psycho-social resources at the family level as well as community
level resources. The latter will be measured combining administrative data and information extracted from
satellite imagery using machine learning. Longer-term impacts, fifteen years after the tsunami, will exploit
innovative human capital measures including biomarkers, executive function and emotional reactivity. Loss of
one or both parents is among the most extreme exposures. We will explore the causal effects of orphanhood
by comparing children who lost parents in the tsunami with those in the same community who did not."

Rotator cuff degeneration results in shoulder pain and disability and a high incidence of rotator cuff tears. More
than half of the population over the age of 65 has a rotator cuff tear, leading to ~600,000 surgical repairs each
year in the United States. Unfortunately, the failure rates after surgical repair are unacceptably high, particularly
in the older patient population with large tears. This project focuses on the subacromial bursa, a synovial-like
tissue in the shoulder that is situated between the acromion and the rotator cuff tendons. This tissue was
previously thought to function as a mechanical cushion and low friction gliding surface to protect the underlying
tendons. The belief that the bursa is biologically inert motivated the current clinical standard of surgically
removing the bursa in many scenarios. Contrary to this practice, our global hypothesis is that the subacromial
bursa is a critical paracrine regulator of shoulder health with important roles in rotator cuff pathology and healing.
Furthermore, due to its location above the rotator cuff, the bursa is an ideal therapeutic target for modulating
rotator cuff degeneration and enhancing repair. In Aim 1, the role of the subacromial bursa in rotator cuff tendon
degeneration and healing will be examined. We hypothesize that bursectomy will exacerbate rotator cuff
degeneration of intact tendons and impair healing in models of rotator cuff tendinopathy. In Aim 2, patterns of
cellular crosstalk between the subacromial bursa and the rotator cuff will be interrogated. We hypothesize that
rotator cuff tendinopathy will activate the bursa through paracrine signaling, leading to recruitment of
inflammatory cells and expansion of resident mesenchymal stem cells in the bursa. In Aim 3, the therapeutic
potential of targeting the subacromial bursa for improving rotator cuff healing will be determined. We hypothesize
that inhibition of inflammatory signaling in the bursa will shift bursa-derived paracrine factors from inflammation-
dominant to regeneration-dominant, leading to enhanced rotator cuff healing. The project will lead to novel bursa-
targeted pharmacologic therapies for rotator cuff repair, addressing the pressing clinical need to improve
outcomes after rotator cuff repair."

Humans, like all mammals, possess a limited natural ability to efficiently replace lost myocardium with new
contractile tissue. This deficiency contributes to heart failure, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the
United States. By contrast, teleost fish robustly restore lost cardiac tissues after heart damage. Heart
regeneration in its natural context builds muscle by the proliferation of existing cardiomyocytes (CMs), facilitated
by the influences of non-muscle cells like the epicardium, which is a mesothelial layer that envelops the outer
surface of the heart and has important contributions to cardiac repair. However, the epicardium itself is a
heterogeneous tissue and which subpopulations offer benefits to regeneration events is far from clear.
 Our study reveals that a particular subset of epicardial cells with hapln1a expression has the strongest
association with regeneration. hapln1a+ epicardial cells first emerge in the ventricle base at the early juvenile
stage, when they associate with and sponsor regions of active CM expansion, events which direct maturation of
the ventricular wall during morphogenesis and restore lost myocardium during adult heart regeneration. Our
preliminary work further indicates that hapln1a+ cells pre-lead and guide coronary extensions during heart
morphogenesis and regeneration. Our single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses of hapln1a+ cells from
juvenile, adult uninjured, and regenerating hearts indicates that these cells are still heterogenous with different
functional clusters. We speculate that hapln1a+ cells can be genetically separated into subsets that are
specifically responsible for CM proliferation and coronary guidance, respectively. Our goal in this proposal is to
identify specific hapln1a+ cell clusters to pursue cell populations for therapeutic strategies. Our overall hypothesis
is that tcf21+ cell derived hapln1a+ cells have different clusters controlling myocardial expansion and coronary
guidance, a process in which has1 and serpine1 play critical roles in regulating extracellular matrix. To test this
hypothesis, we have created a panel of new zebrafish transgenic lines and mutants. We will define hapln1a+ cell
dynamism and related regulators, identify hapln1a+ cell clusters for CM proliferation and coronary guidance, and
the underlying molecular players. Our work will generate paradigm-shifting discoveries in cardiovascular biology.
These studies will reveal the impact of epicardial subsets on heart regeneration and identify key cellular and
molecular players in myocardial regeneration and coronary revascularization. These findings will potentially lead
to new therapeutic strategies like augmenting hapln1a+ cells and subpopulations to enhance the limited
regeneration displayed by humans after myocardial infarction."

Corneal nerves are responsible for transmitting sensory information to the brain, providing feedback on touch,
pain, and temperature, and maintaining corneal health. Multiple studies have determined that corneal innervation
is commonly impaired in corneal disorders leading to opacities and eventual vision loss. The underlying causes
are diverse and include trauma, infection and inflammatory disorders. Unlike the central nervous system, the
peripheral nervous system has the ability to undergo extensive regeneration. However, this process is slow,
incomplete and, in the cornea, often leads to impaired sensory function and symptoms of ocular dryness and
pain. This proposal focuses on the impact that glycosylation might have on corneal nerve regeneration and
sensation.
 Research during the last decade has determined that glycans contribute to the formation and maintenance of
nerves. It is becoming increasingly clear that abnormal glycosylation can alter nerve signaling and consequently
contribute to the pathogenesis of peripheral nerve damage. However, despite these advances, we have a limited
understanding of the types of glycans that are present in the trigeminal ganglion, which is responsible for
providing innervation to the cornea, and their contribution to corneal sensation. We hypothesize that changes in
glycan composition in the trigeminal ganglion following corneal injury will have important consequences to nerve
regeneration and sensation, and could be potentially manipulated to treat neuropathic corneal pain. The following
specific aims will address this objective: (1) to capture the complexity of protein glycans in the mouse trigeminal
ganglion, (2) to determine glycan alterations in the mouse trigeminal ganglion following corneal injury, and (3) to
examine the impact of altered fucosylation on corneal nerve repair, at the anatomical and functional levels. It is
anticipated that the successful conclusion of this project will increase our understanding of the composition and
function of glycans in the trigeminal ganglion, and advance the field of corneal nerve regeneration and sensation.
These findings could also prove important to develop new strategies to promote functional reinnervation by
targeting specific glycan metabolic pathways."

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulates multiple aspects of energy homeostasis including food intake,
energy expenditure, lipid metabolism, and glucose homeostasis via modulation of peripheral organs' functions.
Imbalance of the ANS, primarily increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system, is recognized as a
contributing factor to the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM). Increased activity of pre-sympathetic neurons in the ventral brainstem leads to higher sympathetic nerve
activity (SNA). Since neuronal excitability is largely determined by inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs,
reduced inhibition results in increased activity of pre-sympathetic neurons. The overall goal of this proposal is to
reveal inhibitory neural circuits involved in the sympathetic regulation of metabolically important organs that may
allow the development of strategies to control energy homeostasis via central inhibitory pathways. It has been
generally assumed that inhibitory neurons release only one classical neurotransmitter (e.g., GABA or glycine);
however, our preliminary data identified a novel inhibitory mechanism regulating pre-sympathetic neurons in the
ventral brainstem. Our preliminary data demonstrate that glycine and GABA are co-released in the ventral
brainstem, and blockade of glycine receptors produces a prolonged increase of sympathetic nerve activity, which
was associated with elevated systemic glucose levels. Moreover, glycinergic inhibition of ventral brainstem
neurons was decreased in high-fat diet fed mice These data led to the central hypothesis that the inhibition of
pre-sympathetic neurons in the ventral brainstem is determined by co-release of glycine and GABA, and
glycinergic inhibition is reduced in obesity. The proposed studies will map inhibitory circuits controlling
sympathetic output to the liver and adrenal gland. The electrophysiological studies, in combination with
optogenetics, will define the mechanisms of inhibition of liver- and adrenal gland-related neurons, whereas the
in vivo studies will determine the significance of glycinergic inhibition in the regulation of SNA and energy
homeostasis in control and high-fat diet fed mice. Completing the proposed studies will advance our knowledge
of inhibitory circuits involved in the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system and may provide new strategies
for proper maintenance of energy homeostasis via central mechanisms."

gene delivery methods for brain disease. Employing white matter connectivity to map brain networks is a powerful, well-
established method in laboratory studies, but has not been exploited clinically for therapeutic delivery. The central goal
of this proposal is to advance a focused ultrasound (FUS)-based gene therapy delivery strategy – “circuit focused
ultrasound” (CIFUS) – that utilizes brain connectivity to widely target interconnected brain regions. Our approach
overcomes several longstanding obstacles that have thwarted the tremendous promise of gene therapy for central
nervous system (CNS) diseases. This proposal will advance the development of CIFUS and test the hypothesis that this
approach can functionally rescue key phenotypes in models of a degenerative and a circuit-based brain disease. We will
use a mouse model of Alzheimer disease with tau pathology that spreads across multiple interconnected brain regions
during maturation and aging.6,7 We will use mouse models of dystonia that recapitulates motor circuit dysfunction8,9 and
neurodevelopmental neurodegeneration8,10. Successful completion of this proposal will advance development of a novel

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorder. In MS progression of
disability is irreversible, and prognosis is highly variable; some individuals rapidly progress to a disabled state
whereas others experience only mild symptoms. However, mechanisms contributing to the observed
heterogeneity in disease evolution are poorly understood. Discovery of novel biomarkers associated with risk
of disease progression will not only allow for more accurate individualized prognosis but also facilitate the
discovery of new therapeutic targets that may be relevant for targeting the progressive aspects of MS.
Metabolomics is an ideal technology for biomarker discovery; an individual’s metabolic phenotype incorporates
multiple levels of biologic interaction (e.g., endogenous metabolism, the exposome, and activity of the gut
microbiota). We previously found robust metabolic alterations in people with MS when compared to healthy
people in a study including nearly 1000 metabolomic profiles. Results suggest a marked disruption of multiple
amino acid pathways, with notable reductions in metabolites related to aromatic amino acid metabolism
(phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine). Lower levels of these and other metabolites were also strongly
correlated with disability levels at a single time point. The overall goal of the proposed studies is to build upon
these initial results by evaluating whether certain metabolic changes predict MS prognosis and explore
potential contributing mechanisms using a data-driven approach. We will evaluate, in a prospective design,
whether (1) certain metabolic changes predict subsequent MS prognosis in Aim 1; (2) characterize potential
contributing mechanisms by considering the mediation by MS disease modifying therapies in Aim 2; and (3)
assess the added predictive value of metabolomic markers when combined with traditional measures of
disease severity in Aim 3. Our central hypothesis is that metabolic changes, both in in AAA metabolism, as well
as other novel pathways, strongly predict subsequent clinical and radiological MS outcomes (i.e., MS
prognosis). To evaluate this hypothesis, we will use data and samples collected from nearly 1500 PwMS
participating in three randomized studies. These datasets offer an abundance of advantages in evaluating
metabolic predictors of MS outcomes. For example, they are large cohorts in which standardized collection of
biospecimens and rigorously assessed outcomes are collected at pre-specified longitudinal intervals. These
valuable resources will be combined with validation in clinical, real-world NIH-funded observational cohorts of
400 PwMS. Lastly, our study will apply an innovative analytic strategy applying advanced epidemiological
modeling tools rooted in causal inference. The collective results of this study stand to (1) provide novel insight
into underlying mechanisms contributing to disability accumulation in PwMS; and (2) identify novel therapeutic
targets that are relevant to progressive aspects of MS for which there are few treatments."

postgraduate anesthesia research training at the University of Pittsburgh. Our primary goal is to continue training
physician scientists to lead the future intellectual pursuits in anesthesiology beyond the confines of the traditional

scientific conferences. We propose to add two fellows each year in Years 16-20 and hence request four training
slots per year to ensure a minimum of two-year training for each fellow. A team of 35 principal training faculty
with excellent training records and successful research programs funded by the NIH and other agencies have
been carefully selected. A new cohort of six junior training faculty (five are alumni of this training program) will
be paired with more senior faculty to actively participate in the mentoring of our future trainees. Programmed
training and research activities will target anesthesiology-related problems defined in the broadest sense. The
planned two-year training will combine structured didactic and interactive teaching on both a group and individual
basis, as well as one-on-one mentoring in laboratory/clinical research. Multiple courses and online training
sessions in research integrity and scientific rigor are mandatory for all trainees. Departmental, institutional, and
programmatic efforts are established to actively recruit underrepresented minority trainees and people with
disabilities into the program. A supportive mentoring environment ensures the retention and career advancement
of these trainees. The administrative infrastructure consists of the Oversight Committee led by the Chair of the
Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine and the Executive Committee chaired by the Program
Director. The Executive Committee, working closely with the trainees and the training faculty, will be in charge
of the selection, appointment, and assignment of the trainees, and manage the review and evaluations of the

primarily on training physician scientists, will provide both unique opportunities and critically needed resources
for the next generation of academic anesthesiologists to integrate multidisciplinary knowledge from the bench-
top to the bedside."

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive
dysfunction of the cerebellum, impaired movement and cognitive decline. No effective treatments exist for this
devastating and fatal disease, and thus there is a pressing need to increase our understanding of SCA1
pathogenesis. SCA1 is caused by the abnormal expansion of polyglutamine (Q) region in the ataxin-1 (ATXN1)
protein. While motor deficits are well studied, the etiology of neurocognitive deficits in SCA1 remains unknown.
We have begun to investigate etiology of the neurocognitive deficits in SCA1 by asking two basic questions:
where in the brain and how does expression of mutant ATXN1 lead to cognitive deficits? We have already
obtained data that strongly suggest that expression of mutant ATXN1 only in the cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC)
is sufficient to cause cognitive decline in PC-specific transgenic SCA1 mice. However, relative contributions of
cerebellar and extra-cerebellar dysfunctions to SCA1 cognitive deficits remain unknown. Regarding the how, our
preliminary data show alterations in prefrontal cortex neuronal activity in SCA1 mice, supporting the notion that
aberrant function of prefrontal cortex contributes to cognitive decline. Moreover, we hypothesize that the extent
to which the cerebellum contributes to cognitive deficits and prefrontal cortex dysfunction is larger early in
disease compared to late stages when extra-cerebellar regions become affected and are likely to also contribute
to cognitive decline. The current proposal tests this hypothesis using floxedATXN1146Q/2Q mice, a novel
humanized SCA1 mouse model that we recently created."

 Atrophy and fibrosis of skeletal muscle after neuromuscular trauma is a significant impediment to the
restoration of function after severe neuromuscular trauma. Despite this, dynamic assessment tools for muscle wasting
and dysfunction are limited, leaving a critical gap in the orthopedic surgeon’s ability to assess the degree of neurogenic
muscle injury and its ultimate prognosis. This gap stems in part from an incomplete understanding of the role of
increased expression of transcriptional factors and proteases related to atrophy, and inability to dynamically assess
them clinically. Calpain is one of these proteases central to the myofibril destruction of neurogenic atrophy, and
therefore has potential to serve as a marker of muscle atrophy. However, translation of this relationship into a
diagnostic tool is limited by a lack of techniques for real time assessment of calpain activity. The proposed work seeks to
explore the potential for use of optical probes to identify muscle atrophy by examining the relationship between nerve
injury and muscle contractility and calpain activity. Aim 1a will determine if calpain expression and activity will increase
proportionally with nerve injury and muscle dysfunction. Equal numbers of male and female mice will be subjected to a
varying degree of unilateral sciatic nerve crush injury. At a subsequent surgery, at staged intervals, functional recovery
will be assessed with walking track analysis and grip strength testing. Hindlimb muscles will undergo ex-vivo contractility
testing, as well as histomorphometric analysis and relevant transcriptional factors will be assayed. Calpain activity will
be quantified with ELISA kits and with use of a pre-clinical imaging system to detect near-infrared fluorescence (NIR)
within the hindlimb muscles after administration of an injectable calpain sensitive probe. In Aim 1b, a unilateral sciatic
nerve transection and repair will be performed in the mice, and the same series of functional tests, transcriptional
assays and NIR imaging with the optical probe will be undertaken. Similarly, Aim 1c will utilize the same methodologic
assessments, at the same time intervals, after removal of a segment of sciatic nerve. The increasing degree of nerve
injuries and proposed assessments will help to delineate the canonical pathways of muscle atrophy after nerve injury,
and the proposed optical probe will provide a powerful new diagnostic tool.
 As an orthopedic surgeon with a practice devoted to the care of mangled limbs, I understand the clinical impact
of such injuries, but need protected time and resources to develop the skills to study these at a molecular level. In
addition to the investigations described above, I will participate in graduate coursework to improve my understanding of
molecular biology, as well as optical and biological imaging. I will regularly participate in scholarly activities such as
journal clubs and grant seminars through the Musculoskeletal Research Center to enhance my grant writing abilities and
improve my understanding of experimental methodologies. In addition to my primary and secondary mentor, I have
assembled a mentoring committee to give feedback on results and assist with experimental design. This constellation of
planned activities, along with the proposed research methods above will provide me the requisite training and
experience to develop as a clinician scientist with an interest in optical imaging of skeletal muscle atrophy."
10878840,"Insulin and glucagon play a central role in the management of diabetes mellitus (DM). This MPI application
combines key clinical objectives of molecular endocrinology with frontiers of structural biology to design analogs
of insulin and glucagon with enhanced pharmacologic properties. Our overarching goal is to reduce the burden
of T1D through an innovative program of “device-driven protein engineering.” Animal studies will be performed
in STZ rats (Subcontract to CWRU) and non-diabetic dogs (Subcontract to Vanderbilt University).
This long-standing R01 program, now in its 30th year, began as a basic investigation of structure-activity
relationships (SARs) in insulin with application to insulinopathies. The general flowering of this field
internationally now affords translational opportunities to enhance T1D technologies while at the same time
enriching basic insights into foundational principles of hormone SARs. Protein design rests upon two premises:
 Hypothesis 1: That optimization of the molecular properties of insulin and glucagon (i.e., non-
 incremental advances in pharmacologic parameters) can enable transformative delivery devices; and
 Hypothesis 2: That such translational research can provide broad scientific guidance for protein
 engineering in other diseases and therapeutic spaces.
Our preliminary results suggest that two-chain insulin analogs can be made sufficiently stable and rapid acting
to make feasible prefilled, disposable insulin pumps—and indeed that such pumps may be miniaturized to the
size of a postage stamp (Aim 1). Data are also provided that for the first time suggest that insulin can be made
more potent in vivo on a per nanomole basis and without increased mitogenicity (Aim 2). Such modifications
may find particular utility in basal insulin analogs and reduce the high cost of these formulations (Aim 3). Our
preliminary studies toward ultra-stable glucagon analogs (Aim 4) promise to make practical a one-week
bihormonal pump as part of a closed-loop algorithm-based system. We emphasize these technologies because
they may markedly enhance the long-term health of T1D patients, especially in the adolescent age group.
Aims 1-3 exploit general principles of protein design and protein stability, including both natural amino-acid
substitutions and innovative unnatural amino-acid substitutions amenable to biosynthetic manufacture. Aim 4
generalizes these principles to focus on the exquisite challenge posed by the instability of glucagon.
Protein design will be based both on classical insulin crystal structures and on recent advances in the structural
dissection of the insulin receptor (IR) and its mode of hormone binding. Aims 1-3 thus exploit the ongoing cryo-
EM “resolution revolution” via Subcontract to M.C. Lawrence. An interdisciplinary Approach is proposed by a
unique team with integrated MPI Management Plan. Translational significance is highlighted by the JDRF and
recent American Diabetes Association President L. Philipson (University of Chicago; letters attached). The latter
also indicates potential clinical impact in patients with T2D."
10877580,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 We have recently identified that rifabutin (RBT) is hyper potent against A. baumannii and we have
described this unique mechanism of action. We have characterized the mechanism for the hyperactivity and
found that RBT hijacks the A. baumannii iron transport protein FhuE, resulting in a Trojan horse-like, active
accumulation in the bacterial cell. However, FhuE expression is suppressed in the presence of rich media,
containing a high amount of free iron, and is expressed only in nutrient depleted conditions (e.g., RPMI-1640
media and in vivo), explaining why RBT has been previously overlooked. There is clinical interest in the
translation of RBT for A. baumannii therapy and BV100 (RBT IV formulation) is currently being studied in a
phase I clinical trial (NCT04636983) and phase II clinical trial (NCT05685615).
 However, significant barriers remain for the adoption of RBT as a treatment for A. baumanniii
infections. The goal of this proposal is to further support clinical translation through the rigorous testing of a
broad panel of clinical isolates, to develop a preclinical mouse model to model key RBT humanized
pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters to support defining MIC breakpoints, and to establish a high-throughput
RBT susceptibility testing protocol with low iron media that can be adopted by clinical labs according to CLSI
standards.
 Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate a RBT susceptibility testing method according to
CLSI standards. A) Head-to-head comparison of disc diffusion, or iron-depleted MHII and RPMI-1640
broth microdilution for RBT susceptibility testing across independent testing sites. B) Validate quality control
(QC) strains for RBT susceptibility testing across independent testing sites. C) Using our optimized testing
method, determine MICs for 250 international A. baumannii clinical isolates.
 Specific Aim 2: Characterize RBT-antibiotic drug combinations in vitro to identify
synergy and antagonism. A) Determine RBT-antibiotic interactions for antibiotics using a checkerboard
assay. B) Determine bacterial killing and frequency of resistance emergence using a hollow fiber infection
model.
 Specific Aim 3: Characterize RBT-containing therapeutic combinations in murine blood
and lung infection models. A) Determine if RBT-containing antibiotic combinations show in vivo synergy
when measuring CFUs as an endpoint in murine blood and lung infection models. B) Determine if
RBT-containing antibiotic combinations show in vivo synergy when measuring time to moribund condition as
an endpoint in murine blood and lung infection models."
10874026,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The term adverse impact refers to the negative personal reactions, broader speech- or communication-related
consequences, and overall life challenges that adults who stutter may experience as a result of their speaking
difficulties. Though the risk of broader life impact is widely acknowledged, prior investigations have solely
evaluated this risk via surface severity, which does not strongly relate with negative cognitive-affective
reactions (negative thoughts and feelings). This limits the ability of clinicians and researchers to
accurately identify whether specific individuals are at risk for broader life consequences associated
with their stuttering. Similarly, most investigations of speech neurophysiology in people who stutter rely
exclusively on surface severity to group and interpret data using tasks with low ecological validity (e.g.,
speaking alone in a scanner). This raises questions about whether the field’s current understanding of
speech neurophysiology is applicable to real-world environments where people who stutter speak and,
as a result, experience negative cognitive-affective reactions.
The PI’s previous studies suggest that considering sub-group differences in cognitive-affective reactions (how
speakers experience, manage, and cope with stuttering) can predict how speakers let stuttering manifest in
their life. Pilot data collected for this proposal suggest that such sub-group differences can also predict broader
life negative outcomes, such as social isolation. However, it is unknown if other negative life outcomes often
associated with higher rates of mortality in the general population can be predicted from such sub-group
perspectives. Therefore, for Aim 1, sub-group differences in speaker management strategies will be used to
identify risk factors for social isolation, characteristics of depression, and characteristics of anxiety. For Aim 2,
we will examine patterns in neurophysiology during speech and stuttering using ecologically valid speaking
situations (speaking in front of a virtual audience, interviewing for a job), while simultaneously accounting for
sub-group differences in one negative cognitive-reaction common in AWS, Repetitive Negative Thinking (RNT,
i.e., Rumination). Engaging in RNT to high degrees activates right hemisphere attention areas that overlap with
speech motor control, which may impact how well AWS compensate to speech motor deficits during speech.
Overall impact: We will reconceptualize stuttering severity beyond surface features to account for cognitive-
affective reactions when identifying broader life impact and employ this reconceptualization in studies of speech
neurophysiology in ecologically valid communication. Discoveries from this research will, for the first time, directly
connect knowledge of the underlying impairment (neurophysiological differences in speech and language
production) and adverse impact (cognitive-affective reactions). Findings will increase the understanding of
stuttering neurophysiology and lead to more effective and targeted treatment for personalized interventions to
reduce health disparities and increase wellbeing in AWS."

Obesity coincides with pro-inflammatory phenotypes in adipose tissues and the insulin resistance that precedes
type 2 diabetes. Despite a wealth of evidence, causal relationships between obesity-induced inflammation and
insulin resistance remain unknown. In the last grant cycle, we explored how inflammation uncouples obesity
from insulin resistance. We showed blocking interferon gamma (IFN) activation of the transcription factor STAT1
limits pro-inflammatory programs that would otherwise restrict white adipose tissue (WAT) expansion and
decrease insulin sensitivity. We also demonstrated complete elimination of IFN activity mediates many adverse
effects of high fat diet, including weight gain, diminished mitochondrial function, and insulin resistance. Multiple
studies, including our own, observed higher STAT1 expression in WAT of diabetic mice and humans, suggesting
that IFN activity may still represent a pathogenic consequence of chronic obesity. The goal of the current cycle
is to fill vital remaining gaps in our mechanistic understanding of the fundamental ways IFN transmits signals to
transcriptional regulation of metabolism and insulin sensitivity in fat cells. To achieve our goal, we will
demonstrate that the IFN receptor in WAT initiates the metabolic decrement of overnutrition (Aim 1) and
establish the downstream transcriptional outcomes of IFN that repress cellular energy balance in the fat cell
(Aim 2). Lastly, we will determine whether obesity-associated inflammation restricts a novel pathway that
supports lipogenic responses necessary to sustain WAT expansion (Aim 3). Ultimately, such knowledge will
teach us how to leverage the immune system to treat obesity and its co-morbidities."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology begins to emerge in the brain and drives cognitive decline before the onset
of clinical symptoms. It has been known for decades that the basal forebrain (BF) is vulnerable to early tau
accumulation, and yet neuroimaging research of early, preclinical AD has largely focused on tau accumulation
in the temporal lobe, beginning in entorhinal cortex (ERC), and subsequent memory decline. An overarching
goal of the current proposal is to reinvigorate interest in BF research, especially in cognitively healthy older adults
where the earliest, preclinical AD pathological changes can be observed. The broader implication of a better
understanding of how preclinical AD unfolds across the brain is the opportunity to detect the disease before the
emergence of symptoms when interventions can be most effective.
Research Project: In this proposal, BF and ERC will be examined side-by-side to test the hypothesis that a
common, preclinical AD process is unfolding in both regions. Atrophy and tau accumulation in BF and ERC will
be explored, including how tightly correlated these changes are and whether there is evidence of temporal
ordering of these changes (e.g., BF first or ERC first). Cognitive consequences of BF tau burden and atrophy
will be assessed and compared to memory changes associated with ERC tau and atrophy. Specific gaps in the
field will be addressed by exploring relationships of BF and ERC volume/atrophy with PET biomarkers and
longitudinal, domain-specific cognition (Aim 1), determining how patterns of seed-based functional connectivity
of BF and ERC relate to tau pathology burden and spread (Aim 2), and establishing correlated gene expression
relationships across BF, ERC and connected regions to identify common pathways that may underlie their
vulnerability to AD (Aim 3). These experiments will help uncover common drivers of AD vulnerability in BF and
ERC and elucidate the role of BF in preclinical AD, including associations with generalized cognitive decline.
Candidate Development and Environment: This proposal will promote the candidate’s ultimate career goal to
build an independent research program that takes multimodal, innovative approaches to characterizing cognitive
aging and preclinical AD. During the K award, the candidate will extend her expertise in neuroimaging of
preclinical AD by integrating novel PET tracers and datasets while also acquiring new expertise in several key
areas: the anatomy of the BF and cholinergic system, analysis of genetic expression data in concert with
neuroimaging data and advanced statistical approaches grounded in causal inference. The candidate’s training
plan outlines her approach to engage the rich resources available in her lab and the broader UC Berkeley
community, including access to unique datasets, community-building seminars and retreats and world-renowned
faculty across many disciplines. The diverse team of collaborators and advisors the candidate has assembled
for this project will ensure she is successful in leveraging her unparalleled environment toward gaining

10877524,"Project Summary / Abstract
The subiculum is a critical output network of the hippocampal formation and participates in a variety of important
physiological functions. However, in pathological conditions such as temporal lobe epilepsy, its own intrinsic
circuits may initiate hyper-synchronous discharges leading to generalized seizures. In fact, a prominent theory
of TLE proposes a key role for the subicular-specific down-regulation of the KCC2 potassium chloride co-
transporter in the alteration of GABAergic inhibition that leads to the generation of pathological activity.
During the previous cycle, we have studied the isolated subicular circuitry in vitro. We have shown with direct
and sophisticated techniques that subicular pyramidal cells are highly reciprocally interconnected and require
physiological GABAergic inhibition to prevent the emergence of epileptiform self-synchronization. Furthermore,
we have shown that the subicular circuitry is sufficient to initiate epileptiform activity when KCC2 function is
pharmacologically blocked.
Here, we propose to study the critical role of specific populations of local GABAergic interneurons, (parvalbumin-
somatostatin- and neuron derived neurotrophic factor-expressing cells) as well as pyramidal cell functional
diversity under conditions of reduced KCC2 activity. We have found that the exposure of subicular tissue to brain
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, which is abundantly released in the epileptic brain and is known to
downregulated KCC2 in neural membranes) produces a surprising (and yet unreported) change in GABAergic
network signaling. The experiments proposed in the application will study the biophysical, pharmacological,
anatomical and network mechanisms involved in this (previously unreported) GABA-dependent recruitment of
excitatory polysynaptic pathways.
Given the lack of seizure control in ~30% of TLE cases, a new mechanistic understanding of the chain of events
leading to the initiation and/or propagation of epileptiform activity in central networks is of critical importance for
the development of novel therapeutic strategies."
10877607,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Molecular and cellular determinants of Drosophila larva thermotaxis
How nervous systems integrate internal and peripheral sensory inputs to maintain physiological homeostasis is
a major question in neuroscience and physiology. Such integration is particularly salient in the control of body
temperature (thermoregulation). Thermoregulation is a classic example of interoception, as animals must
integrate input from internal sensors (of core body temperature) with input from peripheral sensors (which
often reflect the temperature of the surroundings). In homeotherms like humans, thermoregulation involves
both autonomic responses (e.g., shivering, sweating) and behavioral responses (e.g., moving, using clothing).
Thermoregulation in animals whose body temperatures track ambient, like Drosophila melanogaster,
thermoregulate primarily using behavior (e.g., by exhibiting thermotaxis). Interestingly, although Drosophila
are small, they possess both internal and peripheral thermosensors and rely on the integration of input from
these sensors to control their body temperature. In this proposal, we seek a circuit-level understanding of this
phenomenon, obtaining a mechanistic view of how a nervous system solves such a fundamental challenge.
How internal and peripheral thermosensory streams are integrated by the brain to produce coherent
thermosensory behaviors is not well understood for any animal. We will address this challenge in the
Drosophila larva, as its ease of genetic manipulation, connectome, amenability to optical neurophysiology, and
quantifiable and stereotyped behaviors make it an ideal system for a multi-level investigation of such behavior.
This proposal is a renewal of a long-standing collaboration initially supported through an NIH P01 and more
recently through the R01 we propose to renew here. Using this support, we created the foundation for the
proposed work. 1) We discovered peripheral warming and cooling cells, and their associated molecular
receptors, that control thermotaxis towards a preferred body temperature. 2) We showed that information
from both warming and cooling receptors is combined by cross-inhibition, a homeostatic mechanism known in
control theory. 3) We probed – aided by computational modeling - how the Drosophila larva integrates the
activity of warming and cooling receptors, and postulated the existence of an unknown receptor(s) for absolute
temperatures embedded within the larval core (e.g., in its brain).
In this renewal application, we propose to define the mechanisms of larval core temperature sensing, examine
how input from these core sensors influences responses to temperature, and investigate how input from
internal and peripheral thermosensors is transmitted to the brain. The long-term goal is to trace these
pathways into the brain to determine how they are integrated to achieve thermoregulation."

Investigating pathogenic mechanisms for rare Mendelian disorders is important not only to identify therapeutic
strategies for lifelong debilitating diseases but also to understand fundamental biological mechanisms. In this
renewal application, we propose mechanistic and translational studies for craniometaphyseal dysplasia (CMD),
an understudied craniotubular bone disorder characterized by lifelong progressing hyperostosis of craniofacial
bones and abnormal shape of long bones. Continued bone accrual in CMD can lead to excruciating
headaches, blindness, deafness, and facial palsy. Severe cases can be life-threatening. CMD patients are
treated with repetitive, costly and risky surgeries when corrections of facial deformity are needed or severe
neurological symptoms occur. Mutations in the progressive ankylosis protein (ANKH) and connexin 43 (Cx43)
have been identified as causes for autosomal dominant and recessive CMD, respectively. To study CMD, we
have generated state-of-the-art research tools, which include mouse models carrying CMD mutations, isogenic
human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with or without CMD mutations, and bone resorbing cells
(osteoclasts) derived from these hiPSCs. In the past funding period, we have discovered the rapid degradation
of mutant ANKH(Human)/ANK(Mouse) protein and studied negative effects of mutant ANKH/ANK on the
cytoskeleton, which determinates cell shape, size, and polarity. We also identified differentially expressed
proteins in CMD osteoclasts and preferential binding partners for mutant ANK protein. However, CMD
pathogenesis is not fully understood and potential therapeutics have not been explored.
Our long-term goal is to utilize our research findings for identifying potential therapeutic targets to reduce or
prevent the lifelong bone deposition in craniofacial bones. In the next 5 years, we will use animal models and
molecular and cellular methodologies that we have developed to focus on mechanistic investigations and
prepare for future clinical studies. Based on our preliminary data and previous publications we propose three
specific aims. We will study the impact of CMD-mutant ANK on cellular acidification of osteoclasts (Aim 1) and
on the bi-directional regulation between the cytoskeleton and an energy metabolism regulator in CMD (Aim 2).
These are likely novel dominant functions of mutant ANK leading to CMD. In Aim 3 we will identify biomarkers
that can be used to monitor the disease progression in patients and mouse models. We will also evaluate shifts
in biomarker expression in response to experimental treatment regimen in our model systems. We expect that
the proposed studies will give deeper insight into pathogenic mechanisms of CMD, knowledge needed to
discover candidate targets for therapeutics. Biomarkers that correspond to disease progression or treatment
efficacy will be the basis for future clinical studies."

10882124,"SUMMARY
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating disease characterized by loss of joint space, degeneration of cartilage at
articular surfaces, remodeling of bone and other joint tissues, and inflammation. Although it is the major cause
of disability in the aged population, not a single disease modifying drug is available. The functions and
identities of the biological processes that pose vulnerabilities to OA and need to be targeted therapeutically are
not known! We propose elevated NOD/RIPK2 signaling in joint tissues confers heightened susceptibility to OA.
Our analyses of 151 families with dominantly inherited OA yielded 7 novel OA-susceptibility alleles affecting 6
components of the NOD/RIPK2 signaling pathway. This pathway utilizes intracellular NOD receptors to sense
damage-associated molecular patterns and signals via RIPK2 to elicit tissue-specific responses. We studied
one disease allele, Ripk2Asn104Asp, in depth. Functional analyses indicate the variant protein drives elevated
pathway signaling. Mice carrying the dominant Ripk2104Asp allele, introduced by genome editing, have
significantly increased sensitivity to post-traumatic OA, and aged Ripk2104Asp mice have severe spontaneous
OA. We hypothesize regulation of Nod/Ripk2 signaling is a central component of the homeostatic signaling
networks and cell processes that maintain the synovial joint.
The initiating factors for OA are unknown. Although chronic systemic inflammation has been proposed as an
OA susceptibility factor, unoperated young Ripk2104Asp mice have elevated expression of OA-associated and
inflammatory markers in their knees without coincident elevation of markers of systemic inflammation. In Aim 1
we use a genetically modified mouse that permits conditional expression of the dominant Ripk2104Asp allele in
selected cell types to identify cells in which Ripk2 signaling affects OA, thus testing our hypothesis that
localized aberrant Nod/Ripk2 signaling restricted to the joint is sufficient to augment susceptibility to OA.
Mouse models of aging-dependent OA are rare and are needed to discover the changes that indicate early
stages of OA. Using mice that constitutively express the Ripk2104Asp allele, in Aim 2 we test the hypotheses that
elevated Ripk2 signaling: i) promotes OA-associated gene expression of multiple joints, and ii) specifically
causes accelerated onset of histologically recognizable age-dependent OA in the weight-bearing knee. RNA-
seq analyses will be used to uncover changes in gene expression patterns and cell populations in the joint that
parallel development of OA. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that the p.Asn104Asp substitution enhances
ubiquitination of Ripk2, which leads to prolonged or enhanced signaling. In Aim 4 we test whether therapeutic
attenuation of Ripk2 signaling in Ripk2104Asp or WT mice can reduce sensitivity or severity of acute injury. The
work will have direct clinical impact, informing efforts to identify biomarkers of susceptibility or early stages of
disease and efforts to design and develop therapies for OA."
10883148,"ABSTRACT: Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most aggressive form of intraocular cancer in adults. Primary
disease can be effectively treated however, ~50% of patients will develop metastasis. Unfortunately,
metastatic lesions are often fatal within one year of diagnosis; making UM one of the most lethal cancers.
Metastatic UM has strong liver tropism and are refractory to standard treatments. As there is a clear unmet
clinical need for viable treatment options, the overarching goal of this application is to highlight novel
therapeutic avenues to treat metastatic UM. Since most UM metastases are found in the liver and are
responsible for poor prognosis, we seek to better understand how the liver microenvironment supports
metastatic UM. In this proposal, we will use in vitro, ex vivo organotypic liver slice co-culturing, and in vivo
experimental modalities to investigate: 1.) How UM liver metastases are susceptible to ferroptosis – a
programed cell death pathway associated with the accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides. Publicly available
datasets and our preliminary data demonstrate that loss of BAP1 – a strong determinant of liver metastases, is
associated with ferroptotic resistance. Furthermore, we found that mutant BAP1 UM can better cope with
stresses imposed by a lipid-rich microenvironment. Lastly, our preliminary data suggest mutant BAP1 UM are
more sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of anti-ferroptotic machinery than wildtype BAP1 counterparts. 2.)
Investigate how liver associated selenoproteome expression help UM stave off oxidative stress. The liver is the
body’s selenium repository and many genes associated with ameliorating ferroptotic or oxidative stress are
selenoproteins – proteins that have at least once selenium containing amino acid, selenocysteine. Preliminary
in vitro and ex vivo liver slice experimentation demonstrate enhanced selenoproteome expression when UM
cells are dosed with exogenous selenium compounds or liver conditioned media. These data are supported by
transcriptomic expression patterns that indicate BAP1 loss (likely metastatic) is associated with increased
genes that facilitate selenoprotein synthesis. 3.) Determine how targeting ferroptosis and the selenoproteome
in UM liver metastases modulates the tumor immune microenvironment. Since ferroptosis is an immunogenic
cell death pathway, we will use syngeneic systems to highlight how ferroptosis or reduced selenoproteome
expression activate both innate and peripheral anti-UM immune responses. Specifically we will investigate how
these stresses stimulate the phagocytic activity of hepatic macrophage-like cells including Kupffer cells.
Moreover, we will use syngeneic in vivo modeling to test how pharmacological induction of ferroptosis or
genetic based reduction of selenoproteome expression shapes the hepatic tumor immune microenvironment.
By investigating the points highlighted above, we will gain mechanistic insights and highlight therapeutic
vulnerabilities associated with the unique interplay between the liver microenvironment and UM metastases."

Mammals use pheromones to find mates, regulate reproduction, and organize social behavior. The
identification of new pheromones, purified from natural sources, has repeatedly triggered new discoveries
about the genes, cells, and circuits essential for social behavior.
 Recently, my lab identified two novel pheromones present in male mouse urine. These pheromones
play an essential role in at least one behavior, the acceleration of puberty in juvenile females. However, several
features of these new pheromones, and the responses of the neurons that detect them, suggest an even wider
role. Structural clues present in these new compounds hint at a previously-unsuspected mechanism for their
detection involving multiple sensory systems, receptor genes, circuit mechanisms, and metabolic pathways.
We propose to (1) determine whether a multisensory complex involving both volatile and nonvolatile cues
coordinate the discovery, detection, and recognition of these vital cues, (2) identify the receptor genes involved
in their detection and consequent behaviors, and (3) test whether stereotyped circuit features contribute to the
production and plasticity of suitable behavioral responses. We believe that the new opportunities afforded by
these novel pheromones will provide new tools to probe fundamental mechanisms regulating mammalian
physiology and behavior."
10873725,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Craniosynostosis, or the premature fusion of one or more suture joints in the skull, is the second most common
congenital craniofacial birth defect with a prevalence of around 1/2500 births. Mutations to Fibroblast growth
factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) are common genetic causes behind craniosynostosis syndromes, including the
FGFR2M391R and the FGFR2Y381D variants which cause Bent Bone Dysplasia Syndrome (BBDS). Our lab has
demonstrated that these mutations affect osteoblast fate via relocalization of Fgfr2 from the plasma membrane
to the nucleus in vitro, but lack of an animal model has prevented the connection of these genetic and molecular
changes to specific symptoms of BBDS such as craniosynostosis. We have developed a mouse model harboring
a Cre-inducible knock-in of the Fgfr2M391R allele. Activating this mutation in neural crest cells (NCCs) via the
Wnt1-Cre driver leads to progressive postnatal fusion of the frontal, coronal, sagittal, and lambdoid sutures. Both
the sagittal and lambdoid sutures consist entirely of mesoderm-derived bone, however activation of the
Fgfr2M391R allele via the Mesp1-Cre driver does not induct pan-suture craniosynostosis. Genetic lineage tracing
of the embryonic mouse calvaria shows that NCCs give rise to the frontal bones, as well as the majority of non-
osteogenic dense connective tissue at the sutures. This suggests that these previously uncharacterized non-
osteogenic sutural cells are regulated by Fgfr2 and mechanistically involved in suture development and
maintenance, as well as the pathogenesis of craniosynostosis in BBDS. Using a combination of genetic lineage
tracing and single genomics, I will determine how expression of the Fgfr2M391R variant alters cell identity and
contributions of dense connective tissues in the postnatal sutures. Among these cells are a population of recently
observed osteofibrous progenitor cells which have yet to be fully characterized but are likely crucial to
maintenance of postnatal suture patency. I will better resolve this population of cells and identify the role of Fgfr2
in maintaining the balance between their differentiation into osteoblasts vs. fibroblasts. I will also expand upon
the knowledge of the nuclear role of mutant Fgfr2M391R and how it alters gene regulation within sutural cells to
induce craniosynostosis. Due to its previously established role in altering chromatin remodeling and gene
expression, I predict that Fgfr2M391R alters chromatin accessibility at additional gene targets. These may include
members of the p53 and Wnt signaling pathways, which I find to be differentially expressed in postnatal sutures
of our Wnt1-Cre; Fgfr2M391R/+ mouse model and have a known role in calvaria development and craniosynostosis.
Using single nuclei ATAC-sequencing, I will determine how the Fgfr2M391R variant alters chromatin accessibility,

10881057,"ABSTRACT
Globally, populations are aging thereby increasing healthcare burden, overall cognitive impairment, and
dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The lack of effective treatments makes it essential to develop new
strategies for healthy cognitive aging, including interventions to slow or prevent cognitive decline. A traditional
Mediterranean diet, rich in polyphenols (PPs), may prevent or delay the onset of cognitive dysfunction in older
adults, preserving healthy brain structure and function, and lowering the risk of AD. These effects, mediated in
part by gut microbiome-derived PP metabolites, highlight the role alterations in the brain-gut microbiome system
play in neurodegeneration. Moreover, high levels of circulating phenyl-γ-valerolactones, neuroprotective
compounds, exclusively produced by gut microbiota from flavan-3-ol-rich foods (e.g., cocoa, tea, berries) are
associated with delaying the onset of cognitive dysfunction in older adults. Intake of such PPs can also change
gut microbial composition and function, altering the physiology of the host's secondary bile acid (BA) pool,
affecting regulatory and signaling functions in the brain as well as cognitive decline and AD. We hypothesize
that, in older adults with enhanced AD risk, dietary intake of PPs maintains healthier brain features and cognitive
function, and that this beneficial effect is mediated by gut microbiota metabolites of PPs and BAs. In this multi-
PI application by leaders in the field of brain-gut microbiome interactions, we will conduct a year-long, multi-center
randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study in 300 older adults in the United States (validation sample of
100 from Northern Ireland) who are at enhanced risk of developing AD. Coupled with this, behavioral interactions
will be investigated with a murine fecal microbiome transplant model incorporating samples from high AD risk
participants on a high PP supplement compared to a placebo. We will apply multiple complementary approaches:
meta and transcriptomic interrogation of the gut microbiome, targeted/untargeted metabolomics for microbiota-
derived metabolites, multimodal brain imaging, assessment of cognitive function and inflammatory status, and
advanced bioinformatic techniques for data integration. The hypothesis is addressed as follows: Aim A: Identify
the protective effects of high intake of supplementary dietary PPs on brain and cognitive parameters in high AD-
risk participants. Aim B: Determine the effect of PP intake on the microbiome, inflammatory, and AD biomarkers
in high AD risk participants. Aim C: Explore causal relationships between PP intake and gut microbial
metabolites, inflammatory and AD markers, brain parameters, and cognitive function. Aim D: Utilize a reverse
translational approach to identify changes in mouse brain and behavior by PP-induced alterations in the human
gut microbiome. Ultimately, we will establish the protective effects of regular dietary PP intake on cognitive
function and on brain-gut microbiome interactions, ideally allowing the development of effective dietary regimes
to prevent or delay the onset of AD in at-risk elderly, thereby reducing cognitive decline and healthcare costs."
10882880,"Project Summary: Lineage and signaling mechanisms specify cell fates, often yielding stereotypical patterns of
cell types. In some contexts, these inputs regulate fate choices in a probabilistic way to produce random patterns.
The mechanisms controlling stochastic cell fate specification, in which a cell randomly chooses between fates
with a set probability, are poorly understood. Stochastic cell fate specification is critical for the generation of
photoreceptors, olfactory receptors, motor neurons, interneurons, immune cells, and stem cells. Breakdowns
cause disorders, including vision impairments, anosmia, autism, immunodeficiencies, and lymphoma. The main
goal of this project is to determine how cell-intrinsic mechanisms including transcription and chromatin regulation
(Aim 1) and extrinsic mechanisms involving cell-cell signaling (Aim 2) control stochastic fate specification.
 The fly eye is an ideal paradigm to study stochastic fate specification because its development involves
a simple, random, binary fate choice. The retina contains a random mosaic of two R7 photoreceptor subtypes,
controlled by the stochastic expression of the transcription factor Spineless (Ss), yielding SsON and SsOFF R7s.
 How transcriptional regulation and chromatin compaction are integrated to turn genes randomly on or off
during development is poorly understood (Aim 1). We found that an enhancer drives ss transcription in precursor
cells to open the ss locus. Transcription ceases and the ss locus compacts in a subset of cells. In terminal R7s
in which chromatin compacts, ss is repressed. In R7s with open chromatin, ss is reactivated. As transitions in ss
transcription and chromatin states are critical for this fate choice, we developed strategies to study ss in live,
developing eyes. To understand how the dynamics of ss expression influence R7 subtype fate, we will examine
ss transcription using a reporter system. To relate the dynamics of transcriptional and chromatin states, we will
use DNA visualization systems to mark the ends of the ss locus and simultaneously live image transcription and
chromatin compaction. To determine the roles of transcription and chromatin factors, we will examine ss
regulation in mutant conditions. As features of this mechanism are observed in bacteria and mouse, our studies
will characterize fundamental mechanisms controlling stochastic cell fate specification across species.
 The stochastic mosaic of R7 subtypes is overlaid on the stereotypical morphology of the fly eye, providing
the opportunity to study how development of these patterns intersects (Aim 2). Hedgehog (Hh) and
Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling, together with the transcription factor Homothorax (Hth), generates the regular
morphology of the eye. We found that the Hh-Dpp-Hth network regulates stochastic ss expression. To address
how this network regulates ss, we will use mutant and ectopic expression strategies to determine the roles of
pathway members. To understand how noise affects R7 subtype and morphological patterning, we will increase
and decrease variability by ablating or ectopically expressing genes in mosaic clones. Our studies will reveal
how a single mechanism coordinates stereotypical and stochastic patterning within the same developing tissue."

Abstract
In the first few years of life, the human brain develops dynamically in both structure and function. Many neuro-
developmental disorders are associated with aberrations from normative growth during this critical period of brain
development. The longitudinal high-resolution MRI data of children from birth to 5 years of age, made available
through the Baby Connectome Project (BCP), affords unprecedented opportunities for precise charting of early
brain developmental trajectories in order to understand normative and aberrant growth. Dedicated computational
tools have been developed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for accurate processing and anal-
ysis of baby MR images, which typically exhibit dynamic heterogeneous changes across time. The goal of this
secondary analysis project is to apply these tools to the data acquired via the BCP to investigate structural and
functional connectomes, tissue macrostructure and microstructure, and their interplay during early brain devel-
opment. In Aim 1, we will investigate the hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex by analyzing areal
differences in neuroanatomical characteristics involving cortical morphology and microstructure. We will utilize
our infant-centric pipeline to delineate cortical geometry by constructing white matter and pial surfaces, based on
which macroscopic features of cortical morphology, such as thickness and curvature, and microscopic features of
myeloarchitecture and cytoarchitecture, such as neurite and soma densities, will be extracted and analyzed. For
completeness, tissue macroscopic and microscopic measurements of subcortical structures will also be included
for investigation. In Aim 2, we will study brain development in terms of dense vertex-wise cortical connectivity.
We will use our infant-centric diffusion model and tractography algorithm to significantly improve the delineation
of white matter pathways, particularly in superficial white matter with characteristically low diffusion anisotropy,
and to reduce gyral bias in establishing dense connectivity of cortical surface vertices. Vertex-wise stationary
and dynamic functional connectivity will also be analyzed. In Aim 3, we will investigate the interplay of multiple
developmental traits during the first years of postnatal brain development. We will study brain subnetworks in
association with motor, language, and visual development. We will assess the associations of these networks
with psychological assessments such as the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) with subdomains including
gross/fine motor, receptive/expressive language, and visual reception.
This project will involve the utilization of multimodal MRI, including structural, diffusion, and functional MRI, to
provide a more complete picture of human brain development. Successful completion of this project will empower
the neuroscience community with improved understanding of the development of structure and function of the
human brain during its infancy."

10886022,"The development of liver metastasis is dependent upon bidirectional interactions between cancer cells and
the liver microenvironment. Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), released from cancer cells and other
resident liver cells, induces activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) into myofibroblasts that in turn
promote liver metastasis. The long-term goal of our program is to define mechanisms governing HSC
activation and develop strategies to target HSCs and the prometastatic liver microenvironment. Recent
advances suggest that HSCs are fueled by aerobic glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and free cholesterol, but
mechanistic regulation of HSC metabolism is not fully defined. Glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) is a
predominant glucose transporter isoform expressed by hepatic fibroblasts and it has to be on the plasma
membrane for glucose to be transported into cells. Our Preliminary Data demonstrate that TGFβ1 induces
endosome-to-plasma-membrane translocation of Glut1 and glucose uptake into HSCs by a mechanism
dependent on non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src (Src) and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein
(VASP). While Src interacts with the small Rab GTPase Rab11 and Glut1 at the endosome, VASP interacts
with Glut1 at the plasma membrane. Additionally, knockdown of Glut1 suppresses myofibroblastic activation of
HSCs in vitro and tumor-promoting effects of HSCs in a tumor/HSC co-implantation mouse model. These
findings led to the Central Hypothesis that the TGFβ1-induced localization of Glut1 on the plasma membrane
and the subsequent glucose transport into HSCs that fuels HSC activation are mediated by Src at the
endosome and VASP at the plasma membrane. In Aim 1, we will study how Src promotes Glut1 trafficking
towards the plasma membrane, with a focus on its regulation on Rab11 activation at the endosome. We will
also investigate how Src is activated in TGFβ1-stimulated HSCs. In Aim 2, we will elucidate how VASP retains
Glut1 at the plasma membrane and promotes glucose transport into HSCs. We will also interrogate whether a
lipid signaling pathway induces VASP phosphorylation in TGFβ1-stimulated HSCs. In Aim 3, we will use
conditional SLC2A1/Glut1 knockout mice and portal vein tumor injection to test if HSC-specific Glut1 deletion
suppresses HSC activation and colorectal liver metastasis in mice. We will also co-inject HSCs and tumor cells
into the livers of mice to test if the interplay between Src and VASP modulates plasma membrane Glut1,
glucose transport into HSCs, and HSC activation within the hepatic tumor microenvironment. The proposed
work will reveal novel mechanisms related to metabolic regulation of HSC activation induced by TGFβ, which
will help to identify new targets to inhibit HSC activation and the prometastatic liver microenvironment."
10886065,"ABSTRACT
Undernourished women in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs) experience greater fetal growth restriction
in pregnancy and poorer birth outcomes, including preterm birth and small-for-gestational age (SGA). Infants
born preterm and/or SGA are more vulnerable to stunting and inadequate neurocognitive development, with
lasting effects through adulthood. Nutritional interventions targeted in pregnancy and lactation have the
potential to break the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition. Recently, an expert consensus developed
specifications for a fortified BEP “ready-to-use” food supplement for pregnant and lactating women in LMICs,
which requires testing in undernourished settings for efficacy in improving birth and growth outcomes.
Currently, there is no recommendation for supplementation for women who are breastfeeding, despite high
rates of growth faltering in early life in LMICs, where maternal undernutrition is high and exclusive
breastfeeding is recommended. Our research aims to 1) Evaluate the effect of daily BEP++ in pregnancy
and/or lactation on infant growth outcomes in the first 6 months of life; 2) Evaluate the effect of daily BEP++ in
pregnancy and/or lactation on maternal nutritional status and explore potential mediation pathways on infant
growth outcomes; and 3) In a biospecimen sub-study, explore relationships between maternal and infant
nutrient status, inflammation, human milk composition, and gut microbiome by supplementation in pregnancy
and/or lactation vs. not. We propose a community-based, randomized controlled trial of daily BEP++
supplementation during lactation in rural Nepal (proposed addition). Our study population has high rates of
maternal undernutrition, adverse birth outcomes, and poor infant growth, and is representative of rural settings
in South Asia. To conduct this trial, we will leverage the infrastructure of our community-based field site and a
randomized trial of a BEP++ supplement in pregnant women scheduled to begin in 2022 (parent trial). The
parent trial will recruit pregnant women in pregnancy, randomize them to supplement in pregnancy or no
supplement, and follow-up until birth to assess SGA incidence. We propose to 1) add a postpartum
supplementation trial following supplementation in pregnancy, using a 2x2 factorial design, to evaluate the
BEP++ supplement during lactation and measure infant growth outcomes at 6 months of life, 2) double the
overall sample size of pregnant women enrolled to allow for detection of meaningful differences between
postpartum supplementation, and 3) nest a biospecimen sub-study within the trial to explore aims on the
causal relationships between maternal and infant nutritional status and infant growth. A sample of 2,000
pregnant women will yield 1,600 live births and 1,440 infants followed until 6 months (accounting for pregnancy
loss and loss to follow-up). This will allow us to detect a difference for our primary outcome, mean length-for-
age Z score at 6 months, between supplement in lactation vs. no supplement, of 0.16 Z scores."
10886023,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This is a proposal from early-stage investigator to address the mechanistic underpinnings of host-biofilm
interaction in the context of surgical implant-associated complications. It is estimated 10 million women
worldwide, including 3 million Americans have breast implants. Over 7 million Americans are living with hip/knee implants. Nearly 300,000 women annually have breast implant surgery in the United States, for reasons including post-mastectomy breast reconstruction (breast cancer and prophylactic mastectomy), revision of prior
augmentation/ reconstruction, cosmetic augmentation, and gender affirmation. Over 1 million total hip and total
knee replacement surgeries are performed each year in the US. With an aging population, there is a demand for
improved mobility and quality of life. The number of joint replacement surgeries are projected to increase
considerably in the future. Total joint replacement surgery is expected to continue to be one of the most common
elective surgical procedures in the coming decades.
There has been increased identification of patients experiencing a constellation of symptoms related to their
implants. The symptoms described include myalgias, chronic fatigue, connective-tissue disorders, and a host of
other manifestations often associated with autoimmune illnesses. In case of breast implants, these constellations
of immune symptoms are named Breast Implant Illness (BII). Similar symptoms have been reported in subjects
with orthopedic implants. Metal/plastic implants for arthroplasty and silicone implants for breasts are made of
different materials. Thus, the underlying cause of these conditions may be associated with factors other than
the implant material. Bacterial biofilms are one of the leading causes of surgical implant failures, infection and
revision surgeries. Despite efforts to maintain sterility during surgery, implantable medical devices can become
contaminated with the opportunistic bacteria from the host microflora many of which can form biofilm.
This proposal aims to investigate the role of bacterial biofilms in the implant-associated illness. Host-biofilm
interactions are guided by the local micro-environmental niche of host in which the biofilm reside. Breast and hip
joint replacements have a host-microenvironment rich in adipose tissue comprising lipids. The proposal aims to
study lipid metabolites formed during biofilm-host interaction. We hypothesize that a lipid metabolite formed due
to biofilm called (E)-10-hydroxy-8-octadecenoic acid (10-HOME) can stimulate CD4+ T cell leading to
autoimmune-like syndromes. The metabolite 10- HOME is a member of oxylipin formed by biofilm acting on host
oleic acid. Oxylipins are oxidized lipids formed from fatty acids by reactions involving dioxygen-dependent
oxidation. Oxilipins have been reported to contribute to inflammatory response. The proposal is based on
preliminary data derived from patient samples, studied extensively using in vitro and in vivo animal models to
understand the mechanistic pathway of CD4+ Th1 subtype activation in presence of oxylipins derived due to
host-biofilm interaction."
10886108,"Nearly 6 million Americans ≥65 years suffer from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or AD-related dementias (ADRD).
AD/ADRD poses significant emotional, physical, and financial burdens on patients, families, and societies. There
is no cure for AD/ADRD, and apart from the June 2021 controversial “accelerated approval” of aducanumab, no
new symptom-modifying drug has been approved since 2003, highlighting the need for AD/ADRD prevention.
Currently, no drug is available to delay the onset of AD/ADRD. The prohibitive cost of developing new drugs or
repositioning partially developed drugs for AD/ADRD treatment would be even more prohibitive for AD/ADRD
prevention as the latter would require larger sample size and longer follow-up. An alternative cost-effective and
efficient approach is to repurpose from >20,000 FDA-approved drugs for AD/ADRD prevention. However,
repurposing of drugs is often accidental. A timely and purposeful discovery of new clinical benefits of old drugs
requires a systematic examination of large comprehensive clinical databases with longitudinal records and long
follow-up, using innovative, sophisticated mixed machine learning and statistical tools. This application has been
prepared in response to the NIA PAR-20-156 entitled “Translational Bioinformatics Approaches to Advance Drug
Repositioning and Combination Therapy Development for Alzheimer’s Disease”. We propose a 3-Step
Medication-Wide Association Study Plus (MWAS+) approach. Our MWAS+ will employ innovative explainable
deep (machine) learning, a powerful artificial intelligence tool for noisy, nonlinear data. We will use Veterans
Affairs (VA) electronic health record (EHR) data of >3 million Veterans ≥65 years (54,411 women; 202,000
African American), ~600 prescription drugs (each used by ≥10,000 Veterans), ≥10 years of history and ~200,000
AD/ADRD cases. In Step 1 (Aim 1), we will conduct a hypothesis-free exploratory case-control MWAS (akin to
GWAS) to identify drugs associated with AD/ADRD in the VA EHR data. Drugs identified in Aim 1 will be reviewed
by a panel of experts for plausible mechanistic pathways and 10 drugs will be recommended for hypothesis
testing in Step 2 using VA EHR data (Aim 2) and external validation in Step 3 using Medicare data (Aim 3). In
Aims 2 and 3, we will conduct outcome-blinded cohort studies using new user design. Marginal structural models
and other causal inference methods, including doubly-robust inference procedures, will be used to estimate time-
fixed (“intent-to-treat”) and time-varying (“as-treated”) effects of those drugs on incident AD/ADRD. The proposed
project is highly significant because it will rigorously accelerate the identification of already approved drugs that
have a high potential to be repurposed to delay and prevent AD/ADRD, a rapidly growing public health crisis.
The project is innovative as it combines state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical methods to conduct an
MWAS+ study that has never been used before for AD/ADRD prevention. In addition, the VA EHR contains high
quality clinical data including pharmacy fill records and rich phenotypic information including fitness and frailty.
Findings from this project will inform future clinical trials to repurpose approved drugs for AD/ADRD prevention."

As major components of the cellular envelope, lipids play myriad roles in the survival of bacterial pathogens.
Pathogens can adjust the biochemical properties (such as electrostatic charge) of their membrane lipids to cope
with the changing and challenging conditions of their surroundings. We study lipids in the mitis group streptococci,
specifically, Streptococcus mitis, S. oralis, and S. pneumoniae, which share a very close phylogenetic
relationship. S. mitis and S. oralis are opportunistic pathogens that are among the leading causes of bacteremia
(bloodstream infection) and infective endocarditis (heart valve infection). S. pneumoniae is a major human
pathogen responsible for most cases of community-acquired pneumonia and meningitis in children and the
elderly, and is a major cause of childhood mortality worldwide. Despite the clinical significance of these
organisms and the critical functions of the lipids in host-microbe interactions, the membrane biology of mitis
group streptococci is understudied and poorly understood. Using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry
(LC/MS)-based lipidomics, we analyzed lipids in the cell envelopes of mitis group streptococci and identified
several novel surface properties which we propose are important for coping with antibiotics, antimicrobial
peptides, and unfavorable conditions inside hosts. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that the ability of
mitis group streptococci to drastically alter the charged lipid compositions of their cellular envelope impacts their
interactions with hosts and their responses to antimicrobial stress. We propose to analyze the structure and
biosynthesis of anionic (Aim 1) and zwitterionic lipids (Aim 2) in mitis group streptococci, and their roles in host-
pathogen interactions (Aim 3). The knowledge gained will lead to a better understanding of the survival and
virulence of these pathogens in the host and may facilitate the development of novel therapeutics to combat
antibiotic resistance."
10886056,"Project Summary: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for approximately 15% of invasive breast
cancers and is associated with aggressive tumor biology, poor prognosis, resistance, visceral metastases and
earlier disease recurrence. TNBC is more common in younger women than in older women and in African-
American and Hispanic women. Platinum-based drugs showed higher sensitivity in TNBC compared to non-
TNBC patients and recently there has been a renewed interest for platinum therapy in TNBC, especially
combination of carboplatin with paclitaxel (PTX). Sacituzumab govitecan is made up of an anti–Trop-2 antibody
linked to the chemotherapy drug (SN-38) and was cleared by the FDA for TNBC patients who have
undergone at least two prior chemotherapies. The FDA granted an accelerated approval for the
immunotherapy drug atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel) for the treatment of
TNBC (for tumors positive for PD-L1). Thus chemotherapy is important in the therapeutic management of
TNBC even in the advent of immunotherapy and targeted therapy. However, chemotherapies are known
to cause fatal peripheral neuropathy in addition to poor response, metastasis, relapse and development of
multidrug resistance. The goal of this application is the development of multifunctional targeted nanoparticles
capable of achieving better outcomes for TNBC patients: (a) targeted delivery of large doses of multiple drugs
into cancer cells (per a single biorecognition event compared to a single immunotargeted drug (e.g.
sacituzumab govitecan-hziy)) to maximize therapeutic effects while reducing systemic toxicity (off target
toxicity); (b) EGFR-receptor targeted nanoparticles that promote intracellular drug delivery and release and
which can bypass multidrug resistant protein (p-glycoprotein) which mediates efflux of drug molecules; (c)
capable of long circulation without being sequestered into the liver. EGFR is overexpressed by TNBC and
literature is replete with examples of the use of cetuximab in therapy by targeting EFGR. We hypothesize that
the development of biodegradable polymeric nanotechnology platform containing carboplatin and paclitaxel
in the core and using cetuximab (tagged on nanoparticle surface) as a targeting moiety will improve TNBC
patients’ outcomes, unlike repeated chemotherapy cycles with high doses of cytotoxic drugs. We hypothesize
that the dual-loaded multifunctional targeted nanoparticles will be active in vitro and show in vivo efficacy in
mouse xenograft models of TNBC positive tumors. Aim #1: Fabrication of polymeric dye-loaded and-paclitaxel
and carboplatin-loaded stealth hydrolysable crosslinked cetuximab surface-targeted polylactide (PLL)
nanoparticles. Aim #2: Characterization of anti-EGFR mAb (cetuximab) surface-targeted-PLL-nanoparticles
containing carboplatin and paclitaxel in the core. Aim #3: Biodistribution and efficacy studies in tumor-bearing
mice. This work will bring to bear the combined power of chemotherapeutic agents, molecular targeted therapy
and nanotechnology to overcome EGFR positive TNBC resistance and improve efficacy with minimal toxicity."
10886073,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lymphatic vessel (LV) differentiation, development, and morphogenesis are central in maintaining fluid
homeostasis, regulating host immunity, and transporting dietary fat and neuronal waste. All these functions
are governed by lymphatic drainage, a transport of interstitial fluid into the lymphatic system through the initial
LVs and collecting LVs. The initial LVs show permeable button-like junction morphology and are ready to
uptake interstitial fluid; by contrast, the collecting LVs are less permeable with zipper-like junction structure,
so that the collecting LVs transport ‘lymph’ to lymph nodes without leaking. Impaired lymphatic drainage
contributes to many human diseases, such as lymphedema, immune dysfunction, fibrosis, obesity, cancer,
and Alzheimer’s disease. While little is known about why LVs become dysfunctional, clinical studies reveal
that inflammation is one of the leading contributors to the lymphatic dysfunction. Although dysfunctional
collecting LVs has been extensively studied, how inflammation impacts initial LV development and
morphogenesis is unclear, because in our current experimental models, including animal models, we often
cannot decouple multifactorial inflammatory factors in the lymphatic endothelium. Since two-dimensional cell
culture has failed to recapitulate three-dimensional (3D) tissue architecture of lymphatics, researchers have
developed 3D in vitro models of LVs, demonstrating lymphatic sprouting, lymphatic network formation, and
LV interactions with other cells. However, these previous models have not created 3D lymphatic structure
with specialized LEC junction development enabling controlled fluid drainage through the button-like
junctions and physiological inflammatory response. In this proposal, we will use a bioengineered in vitro 3D
lymphatic vascular system, exhibiting button-like junction morphogenesis of the LVs and fluid drainage to
understand the regulation of LEC junction and drainage by focusing on ROCK1/2 and integrin α5 signaling.
In Aim 1, we will examine the roles of ROCKs in LEC junction and drainage. Next, we will scrutinize the
mechanisms of ROCKs-mediated junction zippering in LECs. In Aim 2, we will study integrin α5 mediated
regulation of LEC junction and lymphatic drainage. We will then determine signal transduction through
ROCKs and integrin α5 and evaluate therapeutic efficacy of targeting ROCKs and integrin α5 in lymphatic
dysfunction and inflammation models in vivo. In summary, we will use a bioengineered model of 3D lymphatic
vessels and fluid transport to provide an understanding of lymphatic drainage in normal and inflammatory
conditions."

10885598,"Project Summary
The goal of this project is to contribute to understanding of the biochemical and biophysical mechanisms by
which gene expression is regulated. In particular, we seek to understand the operation of the molecular
machinery that regulates production of mRNA by DNA transcription and the relationship between the
composition and structures of the macromolecular complexes that make up that machinery and their
functions.
In this project, we have developed and applied a powerful approach to quantitatively defining the dynamic
molecular mechanisms of transcription and transcription regulation in vitro. Instead of studying populations
of molecules, we use multi-wavelength single-molecule fluorescence methods to directly visualize in vitro
the RNA polymerase and associating regulatory proteins simultaneously on hundreds of isolated individual
DNA molecules in multiplex. We propose continuing studies that apply this approach to elucidating dynamic
molecular regulation mechanisms of the messenger RNA synthesis machinery from an example bacterium
(E. coli) and from a model eukaryote (the budding yeast S. cerevisiae). In both systems, we have chosen for
study transcription factors and regulatory activities that are general mechanisms which act during
transcription of many or most protein-coding genes in the organism. Our studies will advance the field by
focusing not on single regulatory factors in isolation but on understanding the emergent properties of
systems in which multiple regulatory factors act together.
Our immediate goals are to use multi-wavelength single-molecule fluorescence methods in vitro to 1) test

10885601,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive decline
and brain pathologies including amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide deposition, hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation,
inflammation, and synaptic and neuronal loss. In addition to protein pathology, the abnormal accumulation of
lipids in AD brains – originally described by Alzheimer himself in his 1907 publication – has recently been
rediscovered as an important factor in AD. Many recent discoveries in Alzheimer’s disease raise questions of
how lipid-rich microdomains within cell membranes known as lipid rafts might play roles in Alzheimer’s
pathology; why contact points between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), known as
mitochondria-associated ER membranes or MAMs, increase in AD and are impacted by the presence of
APOE4, the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD; how intraneuronal aggregation of tau and toxic Aβ
trigger ER stress in early stages of AD; why changes in mitochondrial morphology such as fragmentation and
elongation occur in AD; as well as countless other recent discoveries. One recent example from our teams was
a demonstration of accumulation of neutral lipid droplets and cholesterol in glial cells harboring the APOE4
allele in the gene coding for apolipoprotein E (ApoE), one of the most significant genetic risk factors for
developing AD. The presence of APOE4 led to LD accumulation in astrocytes, microglia, and
oligodendrocytes. While these findings clearly suggest that subcellular organelle organization and
morphologies play important roles in the development of AD, the mechanisms mediating these roles remain
unclear, largely due to the lack of analytical tools that allow the unambiguous characterization of intracellular
structures in brain tissue from animal models of AD and from human AD patients. The standard method for
investigating morphological characteristics of organelles is electron microscopy (EM) which struggles to identify
specific biomolecules amidst organelle architecture. Our recent invention of expansion microscopy (ExM)
allows nanoscale imaging of biological specimens, including molecular contrast, with conventional
microscopes, and has been employed in studies on the Golgi apparatus, the ER, mitochondria, and myelin.
Here we propose to extend the ExM toolbox to confront, head-on, the key needs of Alzheimer’s lipid research.
Specifically, we will (Aim 1) optimize, and validate, a form of ExM that combines lipid preservation and staining,
multiplexed antibody staining, and expansion microscopy – which we call multiplexed ultrastructure expansion
microscopy (multiplex-umExM); (Aim 2) optimize, and validate, multiplex-umExM for human brain tissue; (Aim
3) perform a comprehensive characterization of lipid accumulation and organelles by brain cell type and AD
risk genotype in mouse and human tissue. The net result of this grant will be a toolbox that anyone in biology
can use to characterize lipid and organelle properties, with nanoscale precision and molecular contrast, in
diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, as well as the validation data to show its utility."
10883203,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the production of antibodies (Abs) to nuclear antigens
such as ribonucleoproteins and chromatin. High-affinity IgG Abs to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) are
associated with more severe disease and the development of lupus nephritis (LN). DNASE1L3 is a unique
secreted DNase that is capable of digesting DNA packaged in chromatin, and null mutations in human
DNASE1L3 cause monogenic early-onset SLE with anti-DNA reactivity. Similar to humans, DNASE1L3-deficient
mice rapidly develop Abs to chromatin and dsDNA. Our analysis of this model revealed that the anti-DNA Ab
response arises from the short-lived extrafollicular plasmablasts supported by the extrafollicular helper T cell
(EF-TFH) subset. Confirming the relevance of DNASE1L3 to human patients with sporadic SLE, we demonstrated
that many SLE patients with LN have reduced DNASE1L3 activity, which is associated with the presence of
blocking Abs to DNASE1L3. These results suggest that by blocking D1L3, anti-D1L3 Abs facilitate autoreactivity
to chromatin and thereby contribute to SLE pathogenesis. In this cycle of the award, these advances will be
leveraged to dissect the mechanisms and clinical consequences of anti-DNA responses in SLE patients with
autoantibody-mediated D1L3 deficiency. The project will continue the team effort that includes experimental
immunology (Reizis), human SLE phenotyping and biobanking (Buyon), and immune repertoires analysis
(Ippolito). In Aim 1, we will further characterize the dynamics and clinical correlates of anti-DNASE1L3 Abs in
SLE patients, and analyze their role in the control of cell-free DNA. In Aim 2, we will clone anti-DNASE1L3 Abs
from SLE patients and analyze their reactivity spectrum and pathogenic potential in vivo. In Aim 3, we will use
single-cell TCR sequencing to characterize the autoreactive T cell clones in SLE patients with Ab-mediated
blockade of DNASE1L3, and in DNASE1L3-deficient mice. Collectively, these studies should provide insights
into the origin and mechanisms of the pathogenic anti-DNA responses in SLE, and facilitate more targeted
approaches towards their therapeutic blockade."
10883259,"Diagnostic error (failure to establish an accurate and timely explanation of the patient’s health problems or
communicate that explanation to the patient) is estimated to harm an estimated 249,900 hospitalized US adults
every year. Most errors are multifactorial, and a majority have cognitive causes. Clinician awareness of these
cognitive causes is vital for preventing future diagnostic errors. However, clinicians often do not have an
accurate awareness of their own diagnostic performance. Specifically, their metacognitive calibration
(alignment between their diagnostic performance and confidence in that performance) may be misaligned. To
help clinicians gain insight into their own diagnostic performance, we developed “Calibrate Dx: A Resource to
Improve Diagnostic Decisions,” which aims to improve calibration by leveraging the ideas behind self-regulated
learning theory and guiding clinicians through a series of steps to generate feedback about their own
diagnostic decision-making using self-assessment and peer debriefing. Pilot work suggests that clinicians think
calibrating their diagnostic performance is “critical” and a “moral and ethical responsibility,” but they previously
lacked a “structured way of doing [it].” Additionally, pilot participants emphasized a need to facilitate adoption
and use of Calibrate Dx in clinical practice. We will use the Safer Dx Framework (which approaches quality
improvement by considering the complex, sociotechnical system in which diagnosis occurs) to systematically
identify barriers and facilitators to Calibrate Dx use and create a guide, enabling further adoption and scale.
Then, we will evaluate whether Calibrate Dx use leads to improved calibration and changes in attitudes or
behaviors related to diagnostic safety in hospital medicine. We will use Kirkpatrick’s Framework for Evaluating
Educational Interventions to guide this work. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Create methodology for evaluating
calibration in clinical practice. Experts will help develop methods for measuring calibration in real, clinical
practice in the hospital setting. Then, the measurement methods will be piloted at two participating healthcare
institutions. 2) Develop implementation guide to account for sociotechnical barriers and facilitators while using
Calibrate Dx by conducting semi-structured interviews across two health care institutions. Interviews will be
conducted with key informants including hospital leadership, patient safety officers, safety and legal staff, and
physician-hospitalists to identify barriers and facilitators to use of Calibrate Dx for learning and improvement.
Strategies to avoid barriers and harness facilitators will be developed to serve as additional guidance for
Calibrate Dx use. 3a) Assess whether use of Calibrate Dx leads to improved calibration. We will recruit
hospitalists from two health care institutions to use Calibrate Dx. We will assess if resource use improves
calibration over time. We will also examine whether clinician-level factors relate to improved calibration. 3b)
Determine whether use of Calibrate Dx affects other attitudes and behaviors related to diagnostic safety (e.g.,
safety attitudes, humility, changes in practice) using a combination of surveys and structured interviews."
10883260,"Project Summary: High-risk neuroblastoma (NB) is responsible for ~13% of pediatric cancer-related deaths.
Venetoclax (VEN) is a BCL-2 inhibitor that has revolutionized adult hematological cancer care. Unique among
solid tumors, ven has demonstrated promising pre-clinical activity in MYCN-amplified NB, but likely will require
rational combinations for clinical activity. In our previous funded work, we have demonstrated VEN makes an
effective drug partner across several combination therapies (e.g. Lochmann et al. Science Translational
Medicine 2018; Dalton et al. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics 2021). In this renewal application, we focus on
two clinically translational combination therapies involving two new classes of drugs, SHP2 inhibitors which
target the MEK pathway, and BCL-xL targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). In NB, one of the more
intriguing discoveries recently has been the hyperactivation of the MAPK/MEK pathway, particularly in relapsed
tumors. However, MEK inhibitors have not proven effective in preclinical studies of RAS/RAF wild-type NB,
which makes up more than 95% of cases. Here, we demonstrate that in a high-throughput screen (HTS) of a
SHP2 allosteric inhibitor, SHP099, that NB are the most sensitive group among all cancers, while MEK
inhibitors are relatively ineffective. We provide preclinical evidence that these inhibitors are favorable to MEK
inhibitors through a series of experiments. Importantly, SHP2 inhibitors form a rational combination partner with
VEN through modulation of BCL-2 family proteins. Lastly, through efforts like a HTS of the co-BCL-2/BCL-xL
inhibitor, navitoclax (Ham et al. Cancer Discovery 2016), we have demonstrated MYCN-amplified NB are
among the two most sensitive solid tumor cancers, mirroring sensitivity to the VEN data, but with marked
enhancement of sensitivity through dual targeting of BCL-xL. This concept has been previously clinically
unattainable due to on-target thrombocytopenia from BCL-xL inhibition in platelets. To circumvent this problem,
AbbVie has developed a BCL-xL targeting ADC ABBV-155. We find the antigen, B7-H3 (CD276), is widely
expressed in NB, and, as a result, combining ABBV-155 with VEN is effective in MYCN-amplified NB.
Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the efficacy and mechanism of activity of SHP2 inhibition + venetoclax in MYCN-
amplified neuroblastoma models
Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the efficacy and mechanism of activity of platelet-sparing BCL-xL inhibitors +
venetoclax in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma models
Study Design: We will further characterize the high sensitivity of SHP2 inhibition with VEN and ABBV-155 with
VEN in vitro and in genomically-annotated patient-derived xenograft (PDX) orthotopic models of MYCN-
amplified NB. We will perform BH3 profiling (BP) to further evaluate the role of BCL-2 proteins in sensitivity and
investigate whether BP and dynamic BP will help us identify sensitive and resistant NBs to each combination."
10883377,"Recent advances in stem cell research over the past decade have sparked considerable interest in their therapeutic potential for treating gastrointestinal and hepatic disorders. By reprogramming somatic cells to pluripotency and differentiating them or directly reprogramming cells between somatic states via transcription factor (TF) overexpression, we can produce clinically valuable cells from abundant sources like skin fibroblasts. Despite its potential, direct reprogramming often leads to low yield and incomplete specification of target cells, limiting its practical use for therapy or disease modeling. Further, while many protocols to derive hepatocyte-like cells in mouse and human exist, there is a current unmet need to derive intestinal-like cells via reprogramming. Building on our previous five years of R01-funded research, we aim to answer why reprogramming is inefficient and how we can guide engineered cells toward a more defined identity and functionality. The conversion of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced endoderm progenitors (iEPs) represents a prototypical reprogramming strategy, producing cells that can functionally engraft the liver and intestine. Our work to date has demonstrated heterogeneity in this reprogramming process, revealing defined conversion trajectories to distinct cell populations. In our proposed research, we aim to; 1) Characterize reprogramming origin gene regulatory state, charting exogenous TF engagement in successful fate conversion. By understanding a) where ectopic TFs bind upon reprogramming initiation and b) the genetic regulatory barriers to this binding, we will reveal fundamental mechanistic knowledge that can be used to enhance the fidelity and efficiency of reprogramming; 2) Characterize hepatic and intestinal potential of iEPs. Our current data suggest that iEPs are a heterogeneous population of cells harboring hepatic and intestinal potential. By employing multiomic single-cell lineage tracing to characterize the heterogeneity of iEPs, we will track their successful engraftment into the liver and intestine to define their cellular potential. Further, we will track iEP differentiation within these target organs to establish a comprehensive blueprint for in vitro cell maturation; 3) Assess and optimize human direct reprogramming to induced endoderm progenitors. While many TF cocktails directing cells to hepatic identity have been reported, there is currently an unmet need to derive reprogrammed intestinal identities. Our preliminary data suggest that akin to mouse iEPs, human hepatocyte-like cells harbor intestinal identity. We hypothesize that the pioneer TF-based cocktails used in human reprogramming install this broad potential. By applying our innovative genomic technologies, we aim to unlock unforeseen potential in these engineered cells, paving the way to produce functional human liver and intestine cells through reprogramming."
10881268,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The nature of obesity-associated islet inflammation and its impact on β cell abnormalities remain poorly defined.
In this application, we explore the immune cell components of islet inflammation and define their roles in
regulating β cell function. Islet inflammation in obese mice is dominated by macrophages. We identified that G
protein-coupled receptor 92 (GPR92) is exclusively expressed in islet macrophages and its expression level is
regulated by high fat diet (HFD)-feeding in mice. Our computer simulation modeling combined with site-directed
mutagenesis of GPR92 has revealed the sites responsible for binding to farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP)
activation, which portend various biological and medicinal functions for GPR92. Although GPR92 agonists have
been reported, their physiological function has not yet been studied. In several studies, the GPR92 locus
(12q13.31) has been linked by a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T2D).
However, the role of GPR92 in this field is largely unknown. Since obesity induces expansion of islet
macrophages and increased pro-inflammatory status which impair β cell function, we hypothesize whether islet
macrophage GPR92 and its activation affect nearby β cell function in obesity. Our recent publication revealed
that GPR92 global knockout mice exhibited reduced insulin+ β cells as well as lower insulin levels, but increased
macrophages in the islets compared to those of WT mice in both normal chow diet (NCD)- and HFD-fed groups.
In this application, we propose a novel approach to harness islet macrophages via a specific molecular target,
GPR92, to regulate intercellular communication with β cells. This strategy proposes to simultaneously regulate
islet inflammation and β cell function in a diet-induced obese condition using genetic and pharmacological means
to alter GPR92 function and further identify the molecular and cellular mechanism of islet macrophage-β cell
communication via GPR92 activation. If successful, this approach will have a significant impact on T2D-mediated
islet dysfunction. Furthermore, insulin insufficiency and beta cell failure occur in all forms of diabetes. This
macrophage-based β cell regulation strategy may also have a broader application potential for other types of
diabetes."
10884262,"Project Summary
Many cell signaling networks rely on tyrosine phosphorylation to convert extracellular cues into cell phenotypic
outcomes. Tyrosine phosphorylation (pTyr) is important to diverse cellular processes and is often implicated in
disease. There has been explosive growth in the identiﬁcation of pTyr, with 46,000 pTyr sites now known to exist
in the human proteome and we understand the function of only a small percentage of these sites. This work fo-
cuses on a uniquely tyrosine phenomenon of phosphorylation – 25% of pTyr fall within protein domains, which are
central to pTyr-mediated signaling networks. We propose to exploit the fact that protein domains are conserved
both structurally and functionally by focusing on tyrosine phosphorylation that is structurally conserved within do-
mains. The fundamental premise is that the functional effect of pTyr within a speciﬁc structural location within a
domain will have the same effect across all domains that share it. This project will speciﬁcally address the novel
possibility that the speciﬁcity of multiple types of domains for their interacting partners is regulated by tyrosine
phosphorylation occurring within the domain. This work is enabled by integrated computational and experimental
approaches, which can: identify conserved tyrosine phosphorylation, hypothesize effects based on the role of
that conserved tyrosine within domain function, use physiological evidence to understand its involvement in cell
signaling processes, and systematically test pTyr effects on domain function in vitro and within cell signaling net-
works. Focusing on two important interaction domains in cell signaling, this work will likely reveal new paradigms
involving pTyr-mediated signaling, which has broad implications in our basic understanding of cell signaling and
could help identify new therapeutic targets across a broad range of diseases."
10870794,"Project Summary/Abstract: Intramembranous bone regeneration is a carefully orchestrated process of
hematoma formation, inflammation, and blood vessel formation and invasion, which are necessary for bone to
form. Among these, a lack of proper blood vessel formation and invasion has been identified as one of the
factors leading to a failure of orthopaedic, dental, or biomimetic implant placements, all of which are dependent
on the success of intramembranous bone regeneration. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to gain
enhanced understanding of vasculogenic or angiogenic processes that occur during intramembranous bone
regeneration and explore the endothelial cell plasticity that could lead to novel therapeutic opportunities for
several orthopaedic or dental procedures. The current knowledge and preliminary studies for this proposal
indicate that both vasculogenesis (new blood vessel formation in the absence of vascular template) and
angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation by sprouting from existing blood vessels) occur during
intramembranous bone regeneration. Also, endothelial cells exhibit plasticity where the cells undergo
endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) within the regenerating bone. Thus, these novel findings set
the scientific premise to the central hypothesis that EndMT is integral to intramembranous bone regeneration.
To address this hypothesis, we propose to determine the role of EndMT during vasculogenesis and
angiogenesis in intramembranous bone regeneration by 1) examining EndMT of fluorescently labeled
endothelial cells and 2) determining the effect of EndMT inhibition on regenerating bone. Successful
completion of the proposed studies will provide novel insights regarding the role of EndMT in intramembranous
bone regeneration that can lead to therapeutic opportunities to enhance orthopaedic and dental care."
10872993,"TET DNA hydroxylases are alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of 5mC
to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), thus promoting DNA demethylation. Mapping of 5hmC marks at single base
resolution demonstrated that the main role of TET enzymes is to maintain gene enhancers hypomethylated and
active. Enhancers are genomic areas to which transcription factors bind to modulate gene expression programs.
Hyperactive clusters of enhancers that are densely occupied by transcriptional factors are termed super-
enhancers and are typically found in cancer. Like promoters, enhancers/super-enhancers are regulated by their
DNA methylation status, a process that often goes awry in cancer. Thus, given that active enhancers and super-
enhancers are oncogenic in nature, and that TET enzymes maintain them hypomethylated and active, we
postulate that increased TET activity may itself be oncogenic. Mitochondria function as signaling organelles by
generating substrates that fuel epigenetic changes, including for example acetylation and methylation of DNA
and histones, respectively. Recently, we and others described a subtler interplay between mitochondria and
epigenetics, wherein the levels of the intermediate metabolites αKG and 2-hydroxyglutarate were found to
modulate the activity of TET enzymes, thus controlling DNA methylation. These findings led us to hypothesize
that intermediary metabolism plays as an important role in the control of DNA methylation. Specifically, we
posited that the mitochondrial enzymes D-2- and L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D2HGDH and
L2HGDH), which catalyze the interconversion of 2-HG to αKG, are integral to the cross talk between
mitochondrial metabolism, TET function and super-enhancer demethylation/activation. To expand on this initial
concept, we sought to identify upstream signals that regulate D2HGDH and L2HGDH expression and,
consequently, influence TET function and enhancer methylation/activity. Using reporter and ChIP assays,
inducible cell lines and mouse models, we recently reported that MYC transcriptionally activates D2HGDH and
L2HGDH and, in a D2HGDH/L2HGDH/αKG-dependent manner, induces TET function leading to DNA
demethylation in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, we discovered that the MYC/D2-L2HGDH/αKG axis also
promotes the nuclear accumulation of TET1, TET2 and TET3, in association with enhanced O-GlcNAcylation, a
post-translational modification executed by another mitochondrial enzyme, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT).
Further, we preliminarily showed that in in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), MYC levels associated with
enhancer methylation and target gene expression. Together, these data uncovered a novel mitochondrial
signaling axis which includes MYC at the proximal point, D2/L2HGDH and OGT at the center, and, distally, TET
activity and subcellular location. In this proposal, we will use human B cell lymphoma models in vitro and in vivo,
to test the overarching hypothesis that intermediary metabolism, in part due to MYC activity, induces TET
function, maintains oncogenic enhancers/super-enhancers hypomethylated and active and promote cancer. Our
specific aims are: AIM 1) Determine the mechanistic basis for the increased O-GlcNAcylation mediated by the
MYC-D2/L2HGDH-αKG axis and its role in promoting TET nuclear localization and enhancer activation. AIM 2)
Define the contribution of the TET activation to MYC-driven lymphomagenesis AIM 3) Characterize the MYC-
driven map of 5hmC marks and super-enhancer activation in B cell lymphoma. The proposed study is significant
because it will define, and mechanistically elucidate, a novel role for MYC in cancer, i.e., activation of oncogenic
enhancers/super-enhancers. Downstream to MYC, the contribution of D2HGDH-L2HGDH (via αKG generation)
and O-GlucNAcylation will impart a post-translational control of TET function, which challenges the current
dogma that these enzymes function exclusively as tumor suppressors."
10872999,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Neutrophils play an important role in the pathogenesis of several common lung diseases including
pneumonia, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Yet, no neutrophil-specific therapies are
available to treat these conditions. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms that control neutrophilic lung
inflammation may enable development of such therapies.
 Our group investigates chitinase 3-Like-1 (Chi3L1), a secreted immune protein with cytokine-like
properties. In preliminary studies using a murine pneumonia model, we have found that Chi3L1 regulates
neutrophil cell fate. Specifically, we have shown that Chi3L1 suppresses apoptosis, promotes formation of
neutrophil extracellular traps (i.e. NETosis, a pro-inflammatory form of cell death), and worsens lung injury. In
this proposal, we seek to build upon these preliminary findings through four sub-aims. First, we will identify the
receptor on neutrophils that mediates the pro-NETotic/anti-apoptotic effect of Chi3L1. Second, we will elucidate
the intracellular signaling pathways responsible for this effect. Third, we will assess the pathogenicity of Chi3L1
in a murine model of neutrophilic asthma. Fourth, we will use sputum from patients with neutrophilic asthma to
establish the relevance of Chi3L1 in human disease. Successful completion of these aims will provide important
insight into the pathogenesis of neutrophilic lung diseases and help to identify new therapeutic strategies for
these conditions. This research will also provide a rigorous training program to prepare the applicant for an
independent career as a physician-scientist studying neutrophil biology in the lung.
 Career Development. To support achievement of these research and career goals, we have assembled
a world-class team of mentors with expertise in each proposed area of investigation including pneumonia,
asthma, neutrophil signaling, NETosis, and translational biology. A tailored curriculum of relevant coursework,
intramural meetings, and national conferences has been developed to reinforce the training gained through
mentored research. Environment. Yale School of Medicine represents an ideal setting for this work given its
collaborative atmosphere, cutting-edge technological facilities, and abundance of internationally-renowned
investigators. The Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine (wherein the proposed research will
take place) is deeply committed to the success of early career physician-scientists like the candidate, as
evidenced by its seven current K awardees. The Department of Internal Medicine is similarly committed, as they
have guaranteed 75% protected research time for the duration of this award. Finally, the candidate is well-
prepared to execute the proposed aims, having received fourteen years of training in biomedical science through
Medical-Scientist and Physician-Scientist Training Programs (MSTP and PSTP)."

10906133,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A key problem in neuroscience is understanding how internal and external information are integrated in the brain to produce
sensory experiences, cognition, and behavioral responses. This integration relies on flexible modulation of sensory
processing in response to behavioral states like motivation, attention, and arousal. Neurons in the basal forebrain are key
mediators of these behavioral states. At the same time, basal forebrain neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s
disease is associated with deficits in both cognitive and sensory processing. Olfactory deficits are especially common across
neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, particularly those associated with dementia. While it has been
hypothesized that olfaction and cognitive processing are linked by common upstream regulatory systems, the circuit
mechanisms mediating this control remain unknown. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to develop a mechanistic
understanding of how neural circuits in the basal forebrain impact sensory processing. The proposed Aims test the
hypothesis that effects of attention, arousal, and reward prediction on olfactory processing rely on precisely timed,
cholinergic signaling within the basal forebrain controlling projection output to the olfactory bulb. In the mentored K99
phase (Aim 1), I will investigate the impact of behavioral state on odor coding in the olfactory bulb using meso-scale, in
vivo two-photon imaging. Under the mentorship of Drs. Ben Arenkiel and Paul Pfaffinger, and with the collaboration of
Drs. Jacob Reimer and Ankit Patel, I will be trained in the technical aspects of meso-scale two-photon microscopy and
computational methods. As I transition to independence in the R00 phase, I will look upstream to processing in the basal
forebrain where I will use a combination of electrophysiology, optogenetics, fiber photometry, and targeted genetic
manipulations to determine how cell type specific, state-dependent signaling within the basal forebrain influences olfactory
learning (Aim 2). Finally, in Aim 3 I will test the hypothesis that basal forebrain cholinergic and GABAergic neurons play
distinct roles in olfactory learning, via impacts on odor processing in the olfactory bulb. To test this, I will use a combination
of targeted genetic manipulations, olfactory-based behavioral platforms, meso-scale two-photon imaging, and fiber
photometry. Together the proposed research will reveal cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying basal forebrain control
of olfactory sensory processing in the healthy brain. Ultimately, this addresses the question of how basal forebrain
dysfunction impacts sensation and cognition in disease, and it will provide the conceptual framework for a future
independent research program."
10875358,"We are excited, if presented with the opportunity, by the prospect of continuing over 3 decades of research into
the mechanisms of peroxisome (PO) biogenesis. Our current work relies on yeast models, which have provided,
and will continue to reveal, deep insights into this conserved and important biological process in humans, while
also enhancing the diagnosis and understanding of the myriad of PO biogenesis disorders (PBDs). Our past
work has centered on PO homeostasis, which balances the biogenesis and turnover processes, but we focus
here on the birth of POs in cells that have no pre-existing POs, because previous genetic screens were done in
cells that generate POs by redundant pathways involving both growth and division of pre-existing POs and de
novo PO biogenesis. In doing so, redundant and essential genes were not identified, leaving a serious gap in
our understanding. We remedy this using a novel, innovative, high-throughput screen (HTS) for PO biogenesis
mutants in cells that are incapable of producing POs via growth and division. We show, using a pilot mini-screen,
that unlike previous screens, our strategy is yielding putative hits in many steps of PO biogenesis, while
identifying both known and novel genes, for the first time, including those involved in PO dynamics. This
promising HTS platform, which we validate by proof-of-concept experiments, has provided a treasure trove of
genes that now need deep investigation to understand how they function. Notably, many of the new genes we
identified interact with known players we and others have been investigating, and a significant number are
present at membrane contact sites (MCSs) between POs and other organelles. This presents a second
fascinating avenue of pursuit, wherein we will probe the importance of metabolite (especially lipids) transport
functions of the ER-PO MCSs. Our analyses will judiciously explore two yeast models to address evolutionary
conservation and derive common, conserved principles. This leads naturally to the third, poorly-explored arena
of interorganellar communication, for which we have found a novel, experimentally-tractable link, which is the
requirement of mitochondrial redox and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for PO proliferation (i.e. increase
in PO number/cell). Thus, each of three new avenues of pursuit is expected to open new doors that will exceed
what we alone can understand, but our long-term vision is to create interesting, new, community opportunities
for future exploration in PO biology, knowing that it will be relevant, albeit indirectly, to patients with PBDs and
the alleviation of their suffering. This proposal represents an expansion of scope by synergizing our molecular
and cell biology efforts with the technical and intellectual prowess of the Aitchison laboratory (SCRI) and is
backed by a significant track record of advances made by both PIs in PO biology. The Aims of our proposal are:
Aim 1: Identify and perform functional studies on the machinery and regulators of de novo PO biogenesis.
Aim 2: Elucidate how lipid regulators, MCSs and PO biogenesis proteins work together in ppV budding.
Aim 3: Understand the role of mitochondrial signaling in the control of PO biogenesis."

PRDMs regulate chromatin accessibility to determine alveolar maturation. Pulmonary surfactant is a
complex mixture of lipids and proteins produced by AT2 (Alveolar Type 2 Cells) which is secreted into alveolar
spaces to reduce surface tension and prevent alveolar collapse during the ventilatory cycle. Lack of pulmonary
surfactant underlies the pathogenesis of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants and
contributes to the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ARDS) in adults. The fetal lung undergoes dramatic changes
in architecture, cell differentiation and gene expression in preparation for birth, increasing surfactant lipid and
protein production required for postnatal lung function. While our laboratory and others have identified genes,
transcriptional regulators, and gene regulatory networks controlling surfactant homeostasis, how chromatin
accessibility is modulated to enable gene transcription necessary for AT1 and AT2 cell maturation and function
remains relatively unexplained. Lacking are data regarding the molecular mechanisms controlling chromatin
accessibility required for the activation of critical transcription factors and their targets before birth and during
alveolar repair. The present application is based on our recent identification of the primary roles of PRDM3 and
PRDM16 in regulation of genes critical for alveolar maturation, remodeling, and gene expression required for
postnatal survival. PRDM3/16 are zinc finger, proline-rich domain-containing transcription factors with histone
modifying activity regulating chromatin accessibility throughout the genome. We have shown that deletion of
Prdm3/16 in fetal respiratory epithelial cells caused respiratory failure at birth, dramatically impairing surfactant
protein production. We will use ATAC-Seq, Cut and Run, and RNA-Seq to identify gene loci regulated by
PRDM3/16 to infer mechanisms by which PRDM proteins interact with AT2 specific genes before birth. In this
application, we will test the hypothesis that PRDM3 and PRDM16 interact in transcriptional complexes
regulating recruitment of histones and chromatin accessibility controlling AT2 cell differentiation and
function in late gestation and during regeneration following viral-induced lung injury in adult mice. We
will identify and test the functions of binding partners and transcriptional complexes mediating PRDM3/16
activity. The gene regulatory networks, physiologic and biochemical roles of PRDM3/16 on AT2 cells, alveolar
structure and function will be identified in vivo and in vitro. The proposed studies represent conceptual advances
regarding the molecular control of alveolar epithelial cell differentiation and function and will provide a framework
for the development of future strategies to modify epigenetic landscapes controlling AT2/AT1 cell function in
health and disease.

scientists trained in biomedical and infectious disease research falls far below national needs. The goal of this
training program is to continue to address this personnel gap by providing PhD training in molecular and
mechanistic research methods to enable post-DVM/VMD candidates to conduct translational research.
 The training program is built upon our strong history and experience in post-DVM research training
at Colorado State University in the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences (CVMBS) and
melds molecular, multidisciplinary methodologies with translational application. Critical thinking in experimental
design and data interpretation, manuscript and grant writing, publication, communication skills, and ethical
conduct of research are stressed in this balanced and well-mentored program. New to this application is:
(1) integration with the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus CTSA (Colorado Clinical
Translational Science Institute, CCTSI) TL-1 training program; (2) greater emphasis and goals to increase
diversity, equity, and inclusion; and, (3) additional emphasis on mentoring and professional development, with
a particular focus on trainee NIH K award preparation. An exceptional and diverse External Advisory Board has
been assembled to assist in strategy to further enhance the goals of this renewal application.
 The program action plan is to recruit rigorously selected, diverse, post-DVM/VMD candidates and
provide training in translational research applications emphasizing experimental and/or natural disease animal
models. The Program is fueled by an abundant supply of talented candidates and a large, elite faculty of well-
funded mentors representing 18 research concentrations and all four departments of the CVMBS. Mentor
faculty comprise 18% of CVMBS faculty and were awarded $22.8M in direct cost dollars in the most recent
fiscal year. Ninety-four percent of completed trainees since grant inception (34/36) are currently employed in
research related positions; 7 of 8 trainees (88%) who have submitted NIH K Series Career Development
Awards have been funded; and 7 of 39 completed or enrolled trainees are from under-
represented minority groups. All 15 appointees during this grant cycle have been women.
 The targeted outcome of the program is to continue to produce DVM/VMD-PhD scientists who emerge
prepared as successful, funded principal investigators and contribute to translational biomedical
research that addresses pressing and emerging problems and challenges in human, animal, and
environmental health (One Health). The intent is that this training program represents a targeted action in
response to a demonstrated need for more translational scientists to fill an alarming deficiency in the
biomedical workforce and contribute to national and global research demands."
10873993,"The overall goal of this project is to enable new methods in neurocritical care through the development of a quantitative framework for modeling human brain dynamics from electrophysiological data. This goal is timely because of an increasing emphasis in neurocritical care on tracking and predicting secondary injury and optimizing functional outcomes, needs that are challenging, unmet and consequential. Indeed, secondary neurological injuries and neurological worsening, including seizures, contribute to cognitive deficits and life-long impairments. The high prevalence of traumatic brain injuries means that the societal burden of these sequalae is significant, and their economic burden is measured in the tens of billions of dollars. Thus, technology that can help clinicians anticipate secondary injuries would provide tremendous leverage for improving the care of critically ill patients. Electrophysiological monitoring, such as the electroencephalogram (EEG), can provide a means to noninvasively examine brain electrical activity in high-risk populations, thus providing a pathway to such technology. However, many paradigms in EEG signal processing and informatics struggle with patient individuality and variation, compounded by the idiosyncrasy of neurological disease. As a result, many current approaches are limited to population-level characterizations and are susceptible to bias in datasets. In the proposed work, we will pursue a new approach to modeling human brain dynamics that is interpretable and robust to individual variability. We will develop and use dynamical systems models that generate simulated EEG activity, then fit these models to patient data in a minute-to-minute timescale. These models capture the internal biophysics of populations of neurons and are thus explanatory from a physiological perspective, setting the stage for innovative clinical applications. Specifically, we will: (i) develop the modeling framework and use it to quantify dynamical effects of brain injury in individual patients, (ii) track changes in internal brain dynamics and states through the course of injury, to predict neurological worsening, and (iii) use the model as an in silico surrogate to predict the response of patients to clinical interventions. We will validate our technical approach through retrospective and prospective studies in a heterogenous dataset spanning injuries and age. If successful, this work would represent a first-of-its-kind demonstration of a data-intensive approach to provide actionable clinical information about individual neurocritical care patients."

 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the primary cause of infant hospitalization from infectious diseases in
the United States. Regular re-infection of adults can occur throughout life during seasonal epidemics, but can
be life-threatening especially to the elderly and the immunocompromised. Despite extensive research, no
vaccine protection is available and current antibody therapy-based immunoprophylaxis remains reserved for
high-risk patients. Recognizing the unmet clinical need for efficacious, applicable, and well-tolerated RSV
therapeutics, it is the goal of this project to pursue a rigorous preclinical characterization and de-risking
program of two orally efficacious RSV polymerase inhibitor classes that we have identified in previous work
and pilot studies.
 Having pioneered RSV reporter virus technology and completed large-scale high-throughput anti-RSV
drug screening campaigns, we have identified two structurally and mechanistically distinct hit classes that both
inhibit the RSV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) complex, a novel uridine ribonucleoside analog and
a non-competitive inhibitor of initiation of RdRP-mediated RNA synthesis at the promoter. Current leads show
potent activity against RSV reporter strains and clinical isolates, nanomolar inhibitory concentrations in
disease-relevant well-differentiated primary human airway epithelia cultures, good pharmacokinetic (PK)
profiles with sustained plasma concentrations, and good preliminary tolerability. Pilot studies have established
proof-of-concept of oral efficacy in the mouse model of RSV infection, reducing lung viral load and hallmark
clinical signs of RSV bronchiolitis. This project will pursue the RSV polymerase target in a two-pronged
strategy, developing the substrate-analog and non-competitive inhibitor classes simultaneously to proactively
mitigate the risk of early stage failure or lay the experimental foundation for future use as companion drugs.
The initial approach will be tailored individually to either series, designed to identify and address potential
class-specific liabilities early in the process. The ribonucleoside analog lead has shown sustained tissue
concentrations of the active triphosphate form and sterilizing oral anti-RSV efficacy. In preparation of formal
development, this class will be subjected to mechanism of action characterization, resistance profiling against
the RSV target, and assessment of off-target effects (aim 1). The first-generation non-competitive inhibitor lead
has been successfully resistance, cytotoxicity, and mechanism profiled, but must be subjected to final structure
and QSAR-guided synthetic optimization of potency and PK properties to uncover its full antiviral potential (aim
2). Emerging confirmed leads of either class will be de-risked using the mouse model of RSV infection,
pathogenesis of compound-experienced RSV populations will be assessed, and PK profiles correlated with
performance in primary human airway epithelium cultures to inform simulations of the impact of physiological,
dynamic drug concentrations on antiviral efficacy and safety margin in relevant human tissue models (aim 3)."
10879056,"This revised application seeks renewal for Years 11-15 of the Training Program in Cancer Biology (T32CB) in
the Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMGCCC) at the University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB). We
are requesting support for 4 predoctoral students and 4 postdoctoral fellows each year. To enrich the T32CB,
UMGCCC will provide an additional postdoc position, especially an underrepresented minority, raising the total
T32CB postdoc slots to 5/year. T32CB focuses on multidisciplinary cancer biology research training with a
translational mission. Our objectives are: 1) to provide productive bidirectional translation between lab and clinic
through research and didactic sessions, 2) to provide outstanding training in critical areas of contemporary basic
and translational cancer research and 3) to recruit and retain a strong group of expert faculty mentors to enable
networked productivity of trainees. These objectives are accomplished in a carefully structured program that
ensures individual flexibility with specific cancer-focused components. The 36 mentors were selected from
UMGCCC faculty based on their published scientific achievements, track record of research funding, interest in
translational cancer research and experience in mentoring trainees. The predoc component, which includes PhD
and MD/PhD scholars, builds from and enhances training in the Cancer Biology Track of the Graduate Program
in Life Sciences (GPILS). The postdoc component provides research training for PhD, MD and MD/PhD
postdocs, including physician-scientists during the research years of Surgery residency or Hematology/Medical
Oncology fellowship training. A longstanding T32CB strength is integration of predoc students, postdoc PhD-
scientists, and physician-scientists who participate side-by-side in journal clubs (JC), in research-in-progress
(RIP) seminars and at the bench in laboratories. The T32CB enjoys strong institutional support and an
outstanding research training environment, with collaborative relationships between translational and basic
cancer research faculty and access to cutting-edge technologies that facilitate specialized research activities.
Based on program evaluations, several innovations are proposed in this renewal application, including expanded
training in cancer genomics/bioinformatics and exposure to cancer bioengineering. Professional development
opportunities prepare all trainees for the next stages in their careers. The T32CB training record is extremely
strong: trainees publish productively and are recipients of awards, grants and fellowships. The effectiveness of
our mission to train the next generation of cancer researchers is high, with 100% of T32CB graduates continuing
in research-related careers. The T32CB leverages UMGCCC’s emphasis on cancer disparities to attract and
train underrepresented minorities at a high rate (18%). A new Diversity Advisory Committee will further enhance
T32CB recruitment and retention of highly qualified trainees from diverse backgrounds. Our team science
approach, guided by stellar mentors, enables our talented physician- and PhD-scientists to create and contribute
to transdisciplinary science that is likely to yield innovative benefits for cancer patients."
10879057,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a high incidence of tobacco use among patients with cancer. Many are unable to quit smoking before
surgery, and relapse rates are high among those who are able to abstain after the initial cancer diagnosis.
Tobacco use is linked to serious complications with treatment, including increased problems with wound
healing after surgery. Contingency management, a behavioral intervention in which abstinence is reinforced
(typically with monetary incentives), has shown promise as an intervention for smoking. In our preliminary
work, we designed a contingency management protocol for pre-surgical cancer patients. A pilot study was
conducted to generate an effect size for smoking cessation at the time of surgery (7-day point prevalence
abstinence), and a secondary aim of creating an effect size for long-term abstinence at 3 months post-surgery.
Patients (N=40) were randomized to receive either: Standard Care + Monitoring (SC; i.e., 3-6 counseling
sessions + nicotine replacement therapy [NRT] + monitoring breath CO 3 times per week with no
contingencies; N=19) or CM (i.e., 3-6 counseling sessions + NRT + monetary payment delivered contingent on
a negative breath CO; N=21). In the CM group 52% (11/21) of the patients were abstinent for 7 days prior to
surgery compared to 16% (3/19) of the patients in SC (adjusted RR=3.3, CI: 1.1-9.7, p=0.03). At the 3-month
follow-up, 43% (9/21) of CM patients remained abstinent compared to 5% (1/19) in the SC group (adjusted
RR=8.6, CI: 1.5-49.4, p=0.02). For the present study, we propose a powered, large scale (N=282) smoking
cessation clinical trial to test a CM intervention for cancer patients. The intervention will mirror our prior work,
focusing on patients who are undergoing surgery for their cancer. No studies have evaluated a CM intervention
with smokers who have a life-threatening illness. However, our pilot data with pre-surgical cancer patients who
smoke has shown that this may be a promising intervention with cancer patients. We hypothesize that this
highly effective treatment, by promoting high rates of smoking cessation, will also be associated with better
surgical outcomes. Interventions for smoking cessation prior to cancer surgery are understudied and a
valuable tool in promoting improved surgical outcomes."
10879059,"Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss, cognitive
impairments, and behavioral disorders. 6.2 million people aged 65 and older are living with AD in the United
States in 2021. Earlier diagnosis of AD holds particular significance as therapies are most effective during the
pre-symptomatic stages before irreversible brain damage has occurred. Tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs),
accumulating decades before symptomatic onset, can indicate the pre-symptomatic stages. According to Braak
staging, tau NFTs start from transentorhinal, then spreading to hippocampus and other cortices at later stages.
Detecting tau NFTs during early stages and clearly resolving their patterns is essential for early diagnosis and
treatment monitoring of AD. With recent breakthroughs in tau tracer developments, Positron Emission
Tomography (PET) can detect accumulation of tau NFTs in vivo. However, due to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
and resolution limits of PET, accurate recovery of tau retention patterns in thin cortical regions is difficult. This is
especially true for early stages when tau signal is weak. Additionally, recent longitudinal studies show that the
accumulation change of tau deposits detected by PET is around 3 to 6 % per year for the AD group, and less for
the preclinical AD group. This small annual change further challenges the signal detectability of current PET
systems. Furthermore, 18F-MK-6240 is a newly developed tau tracer with higher affinity to tau NFTs and no off-
target bindings near early Braak-staging regions, which makes it highly promising for early AD diagnosis.
However, one issue with 18F-MK-6240 is the off-target bindings in the meninges. Given the thin nature of the
cortical ribbon and its proximity to the meninges, quantitative accuracy of tau accumulation is significantly
compromised. Consequently, there are unmet needs to further improve PET resolution and SNR for tau imaging.
This grant application proposes deep learning (DL)-based image reconstruction methods that can improve the
resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of tau imaging. The four specific aims of this proposal are (1) to
develop DL-based static PET image reconstruction; (2) to develop DL-based image reconstruction for dynamic
PET; (3) to develop frameworks that can rapidly produce high-quality parametric images; and (4) to apply the
proposed frameworks to 18F-MK-6240 imaging datasets. We expect the integrated outcome of the specific aims
will be robust and clinically effective frameworks that can generate static and parametric images with improved
resolution and SNR from static and simplified dynamic tau PET imaging."
10884231,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Approximately one-third of all diabetic patients develop a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), of which 50% will result in a
lower extremity amputation due to infection. The medical cost, utilization of emergency care, medical disability, and
increased mortality due to DFUs is disproportionately higher in disadvantaged communities. Current treatment for
DFUs is only 50% effective at preventing amputation because we lack fundamental knowledge regarding the
mechanisms driving the failure of DFUs to heal.
 Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with impaired innate immunity function during wound healing. The innate
immune system is primarily derived from bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To study the effect of T2D
on the development of human innate immunity, I have developed a novel method to harvest and expand human
HSCs and mesenchymal progenitor cells (MSCs) directly from bone marrow tissue explants collected from T2D and
non-T2D donors that underwent lower extremity amputation. The tissue explant culture recapitulates the bone
marrow niche through the co-culture and expansion of human MSCs and HSCs. My preliminary data demonstrates
that an adipocyte-rich bone marrow microenvironment comprises a specialized niche for a previously unrecognized
HSC population and suggests that bone marrow adipocytes may influence the functional properties of the human
innate immune system development through the leptin signaling pathway.
 The proposed work will define the effect of T2D on bone marrow-derived innate immunity development (Aim 1
and 2). These studies will be complemented by investigating the role of leptin, an inflammatory cytokine produced
by adipocytes, in the dysregulation of normal immune cell development (Aim 3).
 This work will be performed under the continual mentorship of Dr. Silvia Corvera, an expert in adipose tissue
signaling and metabolic disease. I will further build upon relationships with my co-mentors, Dr. Louis Messina, Dr.
Michael Brehm, Dr. Jennifer Wang, and Dr. Katherine Fitzgerald, who are renowned for their knowledge and
expertise in HSCs, humanized immune mouse models, innate immunity in diabetes, and immunology respectively.
This work will be conducted at University of Massachusetts Chan School of Medicine. The results of the proposed
work will provide fundamental understanding of the human diabetic innate immune system and have the potential
to translate these findings into development of in vivo pre-clinical models for DFUs and novel immunotherapies (or
other targeted treatments) to treat non-healing DFUs. If funded, this award will allow me to complete a rigorous
training plan to expand my research across disciplines, learn new techniques, and acquire knowledge and skills to
establish an independent laboratory focused on targeting the diabetic immune system to enhance wound healing,
thereby ultimately preventing lower extremity amputations."

Our broad long-term objective is to improve the health of children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),
a condition characterized by accumulation of fat in liver cells, by developing and validating accurate, precise,
practical, and widely available tools to detect, measure, and monitor liver fat. Over 5 million American children
have NAFLD, placing them at risk for type 2 diabetes, cirrhosis, and premature death. Addressing this health
crisis is crucial for our nation. Clinical practice guidelines recommend screening for NAFLD in American children
aged 9 to 17 years with overweight or obesity because early diagnosis, prompt specialist referral, and NAFLD-
tailored management can improve outcomes. However, there is no accurate, precise, practical, and widely
available diagnostic tool to implement these guidelines, a major unmet need in pediatric NAFLD. Quantitative
ultrasound (QUS, US) holds promise to address this unmet need, but notable gaps in QUS technology persist:
Gap 1) unsatisfactory accuracy of current commercial QUS methods for estimating liver fat content in children;
Gap 2) availability of commercial QUS technology mainly on full-size (US) systems, primarily located within
radiology departments, limiting access for many children at risk NAFLD; and Gap 3) poor cross-vendor
reproducibility, which undermines utility. Our immediate goal is to address these gaps by developing advanced
QUS analysis models for use with full-size US or inexpensive POCUS systems in children at risk for NAFLD to
estimate liver fat fraction and classify presence/absence of fatty liver. The models will incorporate technical
innovations to improve QUS accuracy and efficiency. To develop and test these models, we propose a cross-
sectional accuracy and precision clinical study in 140 children (ages 9 to 17 years) suspected to have NAFLD,
who will undergo full-size US and POCUS exams with contemporaneous MRI-proton density fat fraction as
reference. Our three specific aims are: Aim 1. To improve accuracy of QUS on full-size US for liver fat
assessment in children. Aim 2. To translate QUS liver fat assessment in children to POCUS. Aim 3. To improve
cross-vendor reproducibility of QUS liver fat assessment in children. We hypothesize that our QUS models using
either full-size US or POCUS will estimate liver fat content more accurately than other US methods. We also
expect our models to classify presence/absence of fatty liver in children more accurately than other US methods.
Exploratory aims are to: a) explore associations between QUS and histology; b) explore effects of potential
confounders on accuracy and precision of QUS models; c) create a repository of US data, plasma, and digitized
histology for future research. Impact: Achieving our study aims will enable multi-center, multi-vendor trials, which
collectively have the potential to transform clinical practice and therapeutic discovery in children by enabling
widespread dissemination of reliable, practical, and generalizable diagnostic solutions for pediatric NAFLD."
10884346,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Anxiety and risky behaviors are the most prevalent mental health concerns facing adolescents. The adolescent
brain is characterized by a high degree of neural plasticity in which circuit-level formation is very responsive to
environmental changes. There is increasing evidence that most psychiatric disorders have a developmental
origin that is the result of early disturbances in this complex process. Adolescence is a period in which exposure
to altered environmental lighting is decidedly common, as 50% of adolescents in the USA reported using
computers, smartphones, and tablets before bedtime. This intensity of artificial light and the duration of exposure
past sunset is unprecedented in human history. Despite the widespread exposure to night-time light in
adolescents, our knowledge of the mechanisms by which our brain adapts to irregular environmental lighting is
still incomplete. The medial amygdala (MeA) plays a key role in processing emotions and is also one of the
regions, among others, that receives and processes light information. Thus, artificial changes in light exposure
levels, timing, and regularity might generate confusing signals in this region, affecting neuroplasticity and
emotional responses. To study whether light affects neuroplasticity in the MeA, thereby increasing vulnerability
to anxiety and risk-decision making in adolescent mice, I developed a new aberrant light protocol designed to
mimic human adolescent light exposure. This Pathway to Independence Award will provide the opportunity to
build on my expertise in neurobiology and behavioral neuroscience while developing my abilities in fiber
photometry and RNA-sequencing. Aim 1 is built upon our preliminary data showing that aberrant light exposure
alters neurotransmitter plasticity in the MeA of adolescent mice, and that such neuroplasticity contributes to their
vulnerability to anxiety and risky behaviors. Under the supervision of Dr. Barnes and Dr. Young, I will use the
Iowa Gambling Task to test whether aberrant light exposure alters risk-taking behaviors differently in adolescent
and adult mice. With additional mentorship from Dr. Ramanathan in the K99 phase, I will explore whether
aberrant light affects neural activity in selected MeA neurons using fiber photometry-based calcium recording in
behaving mice. In Aim 2, under the supervision of Dr. Preissl, I will investigate whether aberrant light exposure
affects gene expression in MeA neurons and its target regions participating in anxiety and risky choice behaviors,
such as the central amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. These experiments will prepare me for
the R00 phase in which I will study the role of amygdala circuitry in light-mediated anxiety and risky behavior by
combining pharmacological manipulation of amygdalar neurons, fiber photometry, and translational mouse
models (Aim 3). Because the amygdala is a well-conserved structure, the proposed research will be
translationally relevant for understanding the effect of altered environmental lighting during pubertal development
and for the design of appropriate integrative interventions to promote emotional well-being in adolescents."
10884447,"Several reports have highlighted the presence of cognitive and psychiatric manifestation associated with
severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection. Autopsy and CSF studies suggest
that COVID-19 associated injury of the central nervous system derives from a combination of coagulopathy,
endothelial injury with subsequent alteration of the blood brain barrier, infection and activation of microglia and
macrophages followed by release of cytokines. The neurocognitive symptoms may persist in the subacute phase
of the recovery while it remains to be determined what the long-term effects will be.
 The documented involvement of the brain microcirculation by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is likely to contribute to
cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). CSVD pathogenesis is not fully understood and is likely multifactorial.
Among the factors that may link COVID-19 to CSVD are direct injury to endothelial cells, platelets and leukocyte
activation. These processes can then lead to an altered blood brain barrier (BBB) with increased crossing of
activated monocytes into the brain parenchyma. CSVD is clinically quite relevant since it is a leading cause of
cognitive impairment and dementia.
 There are several unknowns that justify the implementation of this proposal. We do not know whether there
is an increased burden of CSVD in those older adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and whether
there will be an accelerated progression of CSVD in this population. It is also unclear whether the initial
endothelial dysfunction induced by the infection may persist in a milder form that is sufficient to maintain a
chronically altered cerebral microcirculation. If this occurs, it will contribute to several neurodegenerative
disorders including vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease.
 In this proposal, we will focus on older individuals aged between ≥65 and 80, who were infected with SARS-
CoV-2 at least six months prior to study enrolment, who were hospitalized but not admitted to a critical care unit
and did not have a significant neurological history prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We will match by age and sex,
150 COVID-19 patients with 150 controls who will be followed for two years. CSVD will be assessed via state-
of the-art magnetic resonance multimodality imaging. We will address the specific aims listed below.
 AIM 1: To assess the severity and progression of CSVD in individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2
compared to age and sex matched controls. Sub-AIM 1: To assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on brain
microstructure integrity.
 AIM 2: To assess in individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, compared to controls, changes in
cerebrovascular function and its association to peripheral makers of endothelial function and altered blood brain
barrier. AIM 3: To assess changes in cognitive performance and its relation to imaging metrics in individuals
previously infected by SARS-CoV-2 compared to controls."

 Protein-mediated charge-transfer (CT) lies at the heart of energy processing in living systems [1, 2]. The
chemistry of biocatalysis, oxidative stress, DNA synthesis and repair, and apoptosis all engage CT pathways
[3, 4], and the malfunction of CT networks leads to disease. Understanding how CT pathways function - at the
molecular, cellular, and multi-cellular levels - represents a grand challenge. And the principles emerging in this
field promise to inform the development of future therapeutic strategies.
 Over the last decade, stunning discoveries were made in the emerging area of extracellular CT. The process
of extracellular CT challenges our understanding of how living systems direct the flow of charge over very long
distances. Organisms that recruit extracellular CT use poorly understood mechanisms, engaging extended multi-
cofactor chains to accomplish long-range (!100 Å) CT. Extracellular CT is significant for many reasons: it arises
in anaerobic infections, inter-species CT, and global bio-geochemical cycling [5, 6]. The strategies used by living
systems to carry out very long-range CT are also of interest for developing novel bioderived power sources [7–10]
and in fields that could benefit from making electrical interconnects between living and nonliving systems.
 While short distance intracellular CT reactions are relatively well understood, the conceptual and theoretical
framework required to describe very long distance CT, including transport across multiple cells, is only beginning
to emerge. The objective of this competing renewal proposal is to leverage our understanding of nanometer
scale CT to elucidate the mechanisms of micrometer to centimeter scale biological CT. At large length scales,
CT requires numerous cofactors and diverse protein structures. We aim to understand how structure and CT
dynamics are linked at extremely long length scales in protein assemblies, where many CT steps must occur in
long chains of redox active cofactors to realize biological function. We propose to study novel living systems that
exploit long-range CT for function, namely bacterial nanowires and cable bacteria. We will use and expand a
diverse toolbox of theoretical methods to understand the CT dynamics in these structures. Our research focuses
on: (1) elucidating structure-function relationships that govern very long distance CT in bacterial nanowires; (2)
establishing predictive models to describe very long-range CT in cable bacteria; (3) expanding and developing CT
models to treat CT in multi-cofactor systems with fluctuating environments; and (4) establishing structure-function
principles that govern CT across the range of length scales in biology, from nanometers to centimeters.
 Our studies involve close ties with experimentalists at the frontiers of CT research. Collaboration will continue
to be a hallmark of this project, with involvement from experimental groups at the University of California - Irvine
(Hochbaum), the University of Southern California (El-Naggar), Aarhus University, Denmark (Nielsen), and the
University of Antwerp, Belgium (Meysman), as described in the appended letters of collaboration."

The International Workshop on HIV Pediatrics is organized on an annual basis prior to the biennially planned
IAS or AIDS Conference. This workshop is the only meeting entirely devoted to research in prevention and
treatment of HIV infection in infants, children, and adolescents, making it the premier forum for the world’s
leading researchers. By bringing together experts from different disciplines with presentations in a variety of
formats, the meeting offers a collaborative setting where the latest developments are presented, discussed,
interrogated, and evaluated.
The 14th Workshop will take place in Montreal, Canada and virtually, July 27-28, 2022, prior to the 24th
International AIDS Conference. The program will include topics from among the following: HIV prevention in
adolescents and pregnant/breastfeeding persons; prevention of vertical transmission; clinical issues in HIV-
exposed uninfected children; pediatric HIV case finding; HIV treatment in infants, children, adolescents and
pregnant/breastfeeding persons; clinical management and coinfections/complications for infants, children,
adolescents and pregnant/breastfeeding persons; and COVID-19. Given previous success with this format, we
expect the 15th and 16th editions to follow this same pattern, including similar program and schedule.
The meeting format is also highly innovative. Moving from a more traditional format of plenaries and oral
abstract sessions, the organizers have introduced unique approaches including structured debates, oral poster
presentations, poster walks, clinical-case presentations, curated panel discussions, video presentations and a
social program including a networking breakfast where junior investigators meet with senior researchers.
Attendance has increased substantially in the last several years with 370 delegates in 2021; highly favorable
annual evaluations underscore the Workshop’s importance.
The aims of the workshop are to provide a platform for presentation and discussion of the latest developments
in the field; to gather leading researchers involved in pediatric and perinatal HIV in a stimulating, interactive
forum; to promote the next generation of research by supporting junior and international investigators; and to
promote diversity with the inclusion of international, multiracial leadership, faculty, and scholarship recipients.
The objective of this proposal is to provide support for three annual workshops including participation of key
plenary speakers as well as members from the community of adolescents living with HIV infection, and to
increase the number of scholarships for junior investigators and investigators from low-income countries."

 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects one in three adults and one in five children in North
America and is a growing public health issue in the United States and many parts of the world. NAFLD, and
especially nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may lead to cirrhosis requiring liver transplant, and liver
cancer, as well as liver-, cardiovascular-, and cancer-related morbidity and mortality, resulting in increased
health burdens and associated costs. The Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH
CRN) has been sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 2002 and has provided important
information regarding the natural history and treatment of NAFLD and NASH in adults and children, and has
set the stage for translational research focused on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and clinical
management of these patients. This application is in response to the Limited Competition for the Continuation
of the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) Data Coordinating Center (DCC)
(RFA-DK-18-506). Our aims for the continuation in response to the RFA are: 1) To complete the pediatric
treatment trial initiated during the previous funding cycle; 2) To develop and conduct a new adult phase 2
treatment trial; 3) To coordinate the concepts, development, vetting, and selection by the Steering
Committee and NIDDK of additional clinical trials in adults and children of novel therapeutic strategies; 4)
To coordinate and facilitate synergistic partnerships between NASH CRN investigators and expert scientists
to use biospecimens, histology, digital imaging, and clinical meta-data to derive novel non-invasive
biomarkers and advance the understanding of genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, metabolomic, and
microbiomic determinants of the pathogenesis and progression of NASH; 5) To coordinate the development
of a natural history cohort study of NAFLD, including both hepatic and non-hepatic outcomes; 6) To
coordinate and implement use of a centralized IRB (sIRB) to oversee all future NASH CRN studies. The
Data Coordinating Center will provide the NASH CRN with leadership, expertise in biostatistical analysis,
study design, data management, multicenter coordination, quality control methods, safety oversight, project
support, communication, and organization, and is eager to continue its collaboration with the clinical
centers, NIDDK program staff, and private sector partners to complete these important research objectives.
The NASH CRN is poised to continue its major impact on the field and directly advance the mission of the
National Institutes of Health to improve the health of the public."

Congenital Heart Disease is the most common congenital anomaly in newborn babies, accounting for one third
of all major congenital anomalies. Despite recent congenital heart disease genetic studies highlighting the
critical role of cardiac transcriptional and chromatin regulators during heart development, our understanding of
how these developmental regulators interact to create the dynamic gene regulatory networks that mediate
heart development remains to be fully elucidated. Thus, we propose to define and assay the cardiovascular
developmental regulators and their gene regulatory networks that direct the development of the vast array of
cardiovascular cell types creating the mammalian heart. To achieve this goal, a multi-disciplinary experimental
and computational systems biology approach will be implemented to: (1) elucidate gene regulatory networks
that establish the cardiogenic cellular hierarchy of the developing mammalian heart, (2) investigate the
spatiotemporal organization of the cardiogenic cellular hierarchy during mouse embryogenesis and heart

10884475,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major source of long-term disability and dementia. Microglia, long-lived
immune cells of the brain, activate to multiple reactive states in response to injury. The extent of pro-inflammatory
activation correlates with the severity of neurological impairments, suggesting that unresolved activation is
pathogenic. The proposed research is highly significant because it will evaluate a clinically safe intervention to
ameliorate harmful TBI-induced microglial activation that may contribute to dementia and other chronic
neurological deficits following TBI. Our data suggest that a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to
glycolysis during pro-inflammatory activation involves impairment to the lysosomal turnover of damaged
mitochondria by mitophagy, which is followed by Complex I subunit degradation. Idebenone restores oxygen
consumption by damaged mitochondria and attenuates pro-inflammatory nitric oxide and interleukin-1beta
production. The restoration of oxygen consumption by idebenone decreases intracellular oxygen concentration.
We found that simply lowering oxygen concentration by incubating cells under hypoxia prevents Complex I
degradation and mitophagy impairment. Unexpectedly, antioxidants failed to yield similar rescue, suggesting a
role for oxygen that is independent of oxidative stress. Using proteomics, we discovered a marked accumulation
of prolyl 3-hydroxylase 2 (P3H2) in a mitochondria/lysosome-enriched cell fraction. P3H2 gene expression within
the brain is microglia-specific, and our preliminary data show elevated P3H2 in mouse peri-contusional cortex
after TBI. P3H2 enzyme uses oxygen as a substrate for proline hydroxylation of target proteins. Idebenone may
suppress the activity of P3H2 by decreasing oxygen availability, preventing P3H2 from post-translationally
modifying mitochondria or lysosome proteins involved in quality control. This study will test the central
hypothesis that idebenone suppresses TBI-induced microglial activation, chronic neurodegeneration, and
cognitive deficits by reversing P3H2-dependent inhibition of mitophagy. The following specific aims employ state-of-the-art mouse models to monitor microglial mitochondrial turnover and include novel methods to sort and
study microglia ex vivo based on mitochondrial function. The experiments in Aim 1 will test the prediction that
idebenone rescues mitophagy in pro-inflammatory microglial cells by decreasing intracellular oxygen
concentration, thereby inhibiting P3H2 activity. Using both male and female mice and considering sex as a
variable, the experiments in Aim 2 will test the prediction that idebenone or genetic P3H2 knockout ameliorates
TBI-induced pro-inflammatory microglia accumulation and neurological deficits by rescuing microglial mitophagy.
Positive outcomes will support translational studies of idebenone to treat TBI-induced dementia, with the
potential to help millions of men and women living with the devastating consequences of TBI."

Among the estimated one million Americans who have screened positive for specific genetic variants related to
Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC) or Lynch Syndrome (LS), less than half are up to
date on evidence-based cancer prevention measures that may increase early detection of syndrome-related
cancers or prevent these cancers altogether. Most patients newly diagnosed with hereditary cancer syndromes
receive extensive initial care from genetic counselors or oncology teams but for many patients without a cancer
diagnosis at the time of syndrome identification, access to regular follow-up care from oncologists and genetic
counselors is limited. Pilot data show that the most frequent source of care for patients with HBOC or LS is the
primary care setting, but many primary care clinicians are unfamiliar with rapidly evolving cancer prevention
guidelines for patients with HBOC or LS. Although primary care clinicians are ideally positioned to make timely
referrals to subspecialists for indicated cancer prevention care and procedures, access to evidence-based
clinical decision support to optimize care for patients with these hereditary cancer syndromes does not exist.
We posit that using primary care clinical encounters to promote appropriate subspecialist referral and testing of
these high-risk patients will improve quality of care and clinical outcomes for patients with these hereditary
cancer syndromes. To achieve this goal, we expand an effective patient-centered primary care clinical decision
support (PC-CDS) system to guide evidence-based care of these high-risk patients, and assess intervention
impact on up-to-date cancer prevention care, shared decision making, and patient self-efficacy in managing
hereditary cancer risks. The web-based nature of the proposed PC-CDS system, its prior success in improving
primary care for a wide range of other chronic conditions, and its high use rates in primary care settings
suggest that this approach to care improvement may be an effective strategy to increase appropriate referrals
and evidence-based preventive care of adults with these hereditary cancer syndromes. To assess intervention
impact on care of adults with specific pathogenic or likely pathogenic gene variants related to HBOC or LS, we
randomly assign 30 primary care clinics with an estimated 2488 study-eligible patients with laboratory or
electronic health record (EHR)-documented HBOC or LS to usual care (N=15 clinics) or to the PC-CDS
intervention (N=15 clinics) and assess intervention impact on (i) up to date evidence-based cancer prevention
care, (ii) patient and clinician assessments of shared decision making related to cancer prevention care, and
(iii) patient self-efficacy in managing their hereditary cancer risks. The project delivers a scalable and adaptive
web-based CDS system that informs patients with specific genetic variants and their PCCs of evolving
standards of care, facilitates timely access to appropriate subspecialty care, and can be extended to guide
delivery of evidence-based care to those with other genetic variants likely to reach Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) Office of Public Health Genomics (OPHG) Tier 1 status in coming years."

Acute retinal ganglion cell (RGC) and optic nerve injury due to trauma, autoimmune inflammation, and ischemia
reperfusion results in permanent disability due to eventual neuronal death. Traditionally, inflammation after acute
neuronal injury has been considered a major driver of secondary damage, leading to neuronal loss. The innate
immune response of infiltrating neutrophils and monocytes (myeloid cells) after neuronal injury results in
production of matrix metalloproteases, proinflammatory cytokines, and reactive oxygen species that are directly
neurotoxic, and contribute glial cell modulation that prevent neurological recovery. However, animal model
studies have demonstrated that certain immune cell subsets can have neuroprotective and reparative effects
including in the eye. We have identified that this immune mediated regeneration after optic nerve crush is initiated
by a novel immature alternatively activated neutrophil characterized as Ly6Glow CD14+ CD101-. These
alternatively activated neutrophils recruit arginase+ (Arg+) monocytes that stay at the site of injury and continue
to stimulate axon regeneration. Additionally, alternatively activated neutrophils modulate microglia that likely
contribute to the neuro-reparative environment after RGC injury. The presence of Arg+ monocytes in the central
nervous system after injury has been associated with inflammation resolution and neurorepair, however the
mechanism in which Arg+ monocytes do this is not known. In addition to understanding the beneficial effects of
alternatively activated neutrophils on recruited monocytes and microglia, we have also identified a human
monocyte population that shows neuroprotective effects and stimulates axon regeneration after ONC. The
overall goals of this work are based on the hypothesis that monocytes can be polarized in situ towards the unique
neuroregenerative phenotype to improve neuronal recovery after ONC. This hypothesis will be interrogated in
three aims. In aim 1 we will determine the interactions between neutrophils and monocytes that result in
monocyte polarization towards an Arg+ reparative phenotype. In aim 2, we will focus on the role of retinal
microglia in contributing to modulation of the ocular inflammatory environment and polarization of immune cells
towards a neuro-reparative phenotype. Aim 3 will determine the translational capacity of these mechanistic
mouse experiments by exploring the neuroregenerative capacity of polarizing human monocytes to stimulate
axon regeneration after ONC. The outcomes of these studies will be to understand the underlying cytokine,
growth factor and metabolic signals that influence monocytes to take on a neuro-reparative role after optic nerve
injury. To date, the role of Arg+ myeloid cells on neuroprotection has been correlative. This work will help us gain
a mechanistic understanding of the factors responsible for driving myeloid cells towards the neuro-regenerative
phenotype and could lead to immune based therapies to drive neuron recovery after acute injury."

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype and poses a clinical
challenge due to the lack of tools to predict patients who are at risk of death due to disease. TNBCs subtypes
were presumed to be a step forward, however, recent randomized clinical trials have failed to document
differential impact of therapy within TNBC subtypes. Immunotherapies will benefit a small subgroup (~7 out of
100 women) of TNBC patients, but are associated with 15-30% increase in grade 3 immune toxicities. Currently,
all patients with TNBCs are offered chemotherapy-based regimens either after surgery (70%) or less often
(~30%) before surgery (neo-adjuvant). For the 30% of TNBC patients prescribed neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in
TNBC patients presence or absence of residual disease has been used for optimizing escalation or de-escalation
strategies. Studies such as the SWOG 2212 (SCARLET) are being proposed to de-escalate neo-adjuvant
chemotherapy in TNBC based on TILs with residual disease as the endpoint. However, for the 70% of TNBC
patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, there are no established prognostic tools, apart for TILs, for de-
escalating therapies. Better tools are necessary to identify potentially lethal TNBC cases with high accuracy. The
overall objective of this grant is to develop novel tools for prediction of risk of lethality in TNBC using a multi-
modal approach. The central hypothesis is that accuracy of lethality prediction can be improved by a multi-scale
approach comprising novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools of mammographic images and pathology
including spatial immune analysis. The following specific aims are proposed: Aim 1) To generate a novel model
of mammographic radiomic features to determine probability of TNBC lethality; Aim 2) To establish the role of
generative adversarial network (GAN) augmented deep learning (DL) model from digital H&E images for
predicting probability of lethality; Aim 3) To profile immune cell topology and spatial relationships and their
contribution to risk of lethality; Aim 4) To integrate multimodal data models for identification of risk of lethality in
TNBCs. A late fusion model will integrate the clinicopathological features with probabilities obtained from
pathomics and radiomics and immune data to develop the CaPRI prediction score for assessing lethality of
TNBC that will stratify patients based on their risk. The score will provide evidence-based rationale for escalating
or deescalating therapy in TNBC. The developed tool, CaPRI score, will be based on multi-modal analysis and
integrate them will clinicopathological features such as age, race and tumor size. The continuous CaPRI score
could be used either as a continuous measure of risk or in a categorical manner (high or low risk). High-risk
patients, like patients with residual cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, would be candidates for escalation
of therapy. Similarly, patients with low risk could be candidates for de-escalation."

Traditional methods for estimating exposure-hearing relations, which typically use pure-tone average hearing
thresholds to define the outcome, may not comprehensively capture useful information encompassed by the
shape of the audiogram across the range of frequencies. Since existing statistical methods are insufficient for
analysis of the audiogram shape data, built on our previous work (R01DC017717) on dealing with multi-layers
of correlation structures in hearing data, we will develop rigorous and robust analytical methods for estimating
exposure-hearing relations when the outcomes are hearing phenotypes characterized by audiogram shapes,
either from supervised learning methods with pre-specified phenotype categories or unsupervised learning
methods with phenotype categories determined solely by the data at hands. In addition, current analytical
methods rely on either pure-tone audiometry data or self-reported hearing data as the outcome, but not both;
these two outcome measures are in fact complementary, and we will develop statistical methods for integrating
the pure-tone audiometric data and self-reported data. We will apply the hearing data analysis methods to the
Conservation of Hearing Study within the Nurses’ Health Study II, the Medical University of South Carolina
Hearing Study, and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). User-friendly publicly
available software development will be a central feature accompanying all new methods to be developed. We
have formed an interdisciplinary team of theoretical and applied statisticians, epidemiologists and hearing
experts, and we expect to be well equipped to solve the challenging problems that have been identified."
10884179,"Summary
Blood pressure (BP) and renal Na+ excretion exhibit diurnal rhythms and dysregulation of these rhythms leads
to nocturnal hypertension, a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease and target organ damage. Multiple Na+
transporters along the nephron are under the control of circadian regulation. In particular, renal abundance of
phosphorylated NaCl cotransporter (p-NCC), a surrogate marker of activated NCC, exhibits robust
rhythmicity in the kidney whereas total NCC (t-NCC) abundance remains constant. Disruption of p-NCC
rhythmicity is associated with impaired circadian rhythm of BP. Preliminary results showed that adipose-
derived soluble (pro)rein receptor (sPRR) functions as a key regulator of circadian rhythm of BP via
angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R)-dependent dephosphorylation of NCC. In this regard, adipose-specific
deletion of PRR or its upstream regulator PPARγ remarkably suppressed circadian rhythms of BP
accompanied with suppressed release of soluble PRR (sPRR). The circadian phenotype was recapitulated by
mutagenesis of the cleavage site of PRR. Supplement of sPRR-His, the histidine-tagged sPRR in these models
was able to restore circadian variations of BP accompanied with improved rhythms in p-NCC. In vitro data
demonstrated that sPRR-His directly reduced abundance of p-NCC but not t-NCC associated with elevated
phosphatase activity. Further intriguing in vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that sPRR directly interacted
with AT2R to control circadian rhythms of BP and p-NCC. Therefore, we hypothesize that PPARγ-driven
adipose-derived sPRR acts via AT2R to dephosphorylate NCC to control circadian rhythm of BP. To test this
hypothesis, first, we propose to define adipose tissue as a major source of circulating sPRR during circadian
regulation of BP and renal function. Second, we will test whether sPRR signals via AT2R in distal convoluted
tubule to activate a specific phosphatase to dephosphorylate NCC. Lastly, we will explore the role of sPRR-
His and AT2R agonist C21 as novel chronotherapeutic agents in diet-induced obesity mice. New information
resulted from this proposal will help define sPRR-mediated communication between adipose tissue and
kidneys in regulation of circadian rhythm of BP."

Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) has been increasing worldwide, in both adults and youth. Youth-onset T2D is strongly
associated with obesity, characterized by rapid β-cell failure, early morbidity and mortality, and it almost
universally presents in mid-puberty, a period of physiologic insulin resistance.
However, our knowledge of the pathophysiology of youth-onset T2D is limited as it is primarily derived from
cross-sectional studies, and longitudinal studies do not span the entire pubertal transition or only include youth
with obesity. Such studies are not able to provide an understanding of the physiologic changes in glucose-insulin
homeostasis during puberty, and of how prior metabolic health influences them. We also know of several risk
factors for youth-onset T2D, but we do not know how they operate. These gaps prevent us from accurately
predicting and preventing youth-onset T2D.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to improve our understanding of metabolic health and dysregulation
during puberty, and their determinants. To address this goal we propose to extend the longitudinal follow-up of
the Healthy Start (HS) Cohort, a maternal-offspring community-based cohort study that enrolled 1418 pregnant
women and conducted detailed characterization of mothers during pregnancy, of offspring through age ~7 years
(R01DK076648), and ongoing at ages 8-10 years (through the Environmental Influences on Child Health
Outcomes –ECHO- Consortium, UH3OD023248). This cohort is now transitioning through puberty.
We will follow up 500 youth age 10-15 years throughout puberty to address specific aims: Aim 1: Describe
glycemic trajectories [A1c, fasting and postload glucose, area under the glucose curve, time to peak during an
oral glucose tolerance test-OGTT], and their metabolic correlates, during puberty; Aim 2: Explore the sequence
of metabolic changes linking early life exposures to pubertal glucose-insulin homeostasis; Aim 3: Assess the
importance of established genetic risk factors and characterize gene-environment interactions on pubertal
glucose-insulin homeostasis.
An improved understanding of the physiological changes in glucose-insulin homeostasis as youth transition
through puberty will provide foundational knowledge to better predict future youth-onset T2D risk. An improved
knowledge of the sequence of metabolic changes resulting from early life exposures and influencing adiposity
and glucose-insulin metabolism, in the context of genetic susceptibility to T2D, will inform potential prevention
approaches."

expansion of our program to include the DMD/PhD program at our long-time affiliate, Harvard School of Dental
Medicine (HSDM). The underlying rationale is to build on the strengths of our current separate training programs
that focus on the development of research-focus dentist scientists and oral health researchers and to broaden
the scope to include both predoctoral and postdoctoral applicants for academic careers in the NIH funding
environment. This application seeks to integrate valuable and synergistic features to enhance the pipeline of
dentist scientists and oral health researchers. We will build on the strength of our NIH-sponsored T90/R90
postdoctoral training program to develop a diverse group of committed, highly trained and competitive
investigators who seek to obtain collaborative, multidisciplinary research training (basic, translational, or clinical)
applicable to oral and craniofacial diseases, conditions and disorders that will take advantage of the most current
scientific and collaborative strategies. Collaborative and multidisciplinary research is emphasized, in part, by
recruiting trainees into collaborative investigations within or between broadly focused researchers at Forsyth and
HSDM. The program is guided by an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), led by Dr. Thomas Van Dyke (Program
Director), Dr. Yingzi Yang (Co-Director) and Dr. Xuesong He (Assistant Director). Expert biannual program
review is provided by an External Advisory Committee of Drs. Jane Weintraub (University of North Carolina),
Jeffrey Ebersole (University of Nevada, Las Vegas) and Charles Serhan (Harvard Medical School). The program
provides support for six trainees per year; 4 postdoctoral and 2 DMD/PhD. Trainees will take required
courses/workshops including Responsible Conduct of Research, Methods for Enhancing Reproducibility,
Elements of Grant Writing, Grant Review and Support, Maximizing the Mentor-Mentee Relationship, and
Effectively Communicating Research. Additional elective and non-elective opportunities will be tailored to the
individual's needs and programs. Tutorials and seminars in grantsmanship, grant writing skills, and successful
teaching and presentation are each part of trainees’ programs. There are also opportunities for mentoring high
school student summer research which not only provides trainees with valuable mentoring experience, but also
enriches the pipeline for those selecting research-intensive health-related careers in the future. Trainees’
progress is reviewed weekly by the mentor and semiannually by program staff for reappointment and guidance.
An IAC member is assigned to each trainee for guidance and assistance in grant preparation/review. All
postdoctoral trainees are required to prepare and submit a K or R grant application and DMD/PhD’s are
encouraged to submit F31 applications. Provision is made for informal and formal trainee feedback (current and
post-program) and for trainee tracking following completion of the program."
10878707,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 In 2010 we proposed, and in 2013 revised, a hypothetical model of the temporal evolution of biomarkers
and clinical symptoms for individuals in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathway. The biomarker model is based
on a hypothesized cause and effect sequence which can be summarized as: amyloidosis (A), promotes
tauopathy (T), which promotes neurodegeneration (N), which is the proximate cause of clinical symptoms (C).
For simplicity, we use this ATNC notation: A T  N  C. The current cycle of AG011378 was designed to
test aspects of this model that were testable using imaging; however, a major missing element when the
current cycle AG011378 began in 2013 was a method to measure fibrillar tau deposits with imaging. Tau PET
has recently become available and, consequently for the first time, imaging biomarkers exist to ascertain three
of the most important pathologic features of AD: amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration.
 An important insight gained from the current cycle of AG011378 was that modeling AD biomarkers on the
assumption that AD is the only pathological process present in the general aging population is conceptually
flawed. We argue that biomarker modeling within the general aging population should accommodate at least
three broad groups based on currently available biomarkers: (1) individuals with no biomarker abnormalities
whose future biomarker profiles are unknown; (2) individuals along the Alzheimer’s continuum; and (3) a
heterogeneous group with primarily suspected non-AD pathologies (SNAP).
 Our aims in this renewal are based on modeling longitudinal amyloid PET (A), tau PET (T), and MRI (N)
biomarkers. The overarching goals of the renewal are to empirically evaluate our hypothetical model of AD
biomarkers and to create complementary imaging biomarker models for individuals who are not in the
Alzheimer’s continuum. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1. To model the sequence of biomarker and clinical transitions over time across multiple pathways. Aim 1
employs hidden Markov models. 1a) To model the sequence of biomarker and clinical transitions in the
Alzheimer’s continuum, 1b) To model the sequence of biomarker and clinical transitions in SNAP pathways.
Aim 2. To model continuous biomarker and clinical trajectories over time across multiple pathways. Aim 2
analyses employ non-linear latent class mixed models. 2a) To model biomarker and clinical trajectories in the
Alzheimer’s continuum, 2b) To model biomarker and clinical trajectories in SNAP pathways.
Aim 3. To formulate mechanistic inferences about biomarker and clinical changes over time across multiple
pathways. 3a) inferences in the Alzheimer’s continuum, 3b) inferences in SNAP pathways.
Aim 4: To establish temporal ordering of topographic spread of A, T, and N within each modality, across
imaging modalities, and establish how these temporal orderings relate to cognitive impairment within (4a) the
Alzheimer’s continuum and (4b) the SNAP pathways. Aim 4 uses a conditional probability approach."

Hypertension is a primary modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal disease, and is
the largest individual contributing factor to disease and mortality in the world. Salt-sensitive hypertensive
individuals, who comprise 30-50% of the hypertensive population, have greater mortality than subjects with salt-
resistant hypertension and exhibit renal end-organ damage. We recently discovered a novel anti-hypertensive
mechanism that is mediated by Cluster of Differentiation 14 (CD14) and enhanced in females relative to
males. CD14 is a co-receptor with Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4). Interestingly, the expression of CD14 in
leukocytes and level of plasma CD14 protein are increased in cardiovascular disease and hypertension in
humans. We propose that CD14 signaling in macrophages in the kidney opposes the effects of TLR4 and leads
to the attenuated release of free radicals and the proinflammatory cytokine Il-1β, blunted T cell activation, and
attenuated salt-sensitive hypertension.
This project is based upon our unique (and somewhat surprising) observation that genetic deletion of CD14,
which is upregulated in macrophages in the kidney of Dahl Salt-Sensitive (SS) rats fed high salt, leads to
increased release of the proinflammatory cytokine Il-1β and reactive oxygen species. Remarkably, we observed
that female Dahl SS rats lacking CD14 (SSCD14-/-) exhibit amplified salt-sensitive hypertension and renal damage
compared to wild type littermates. Further study demonstrated that the effects of CD14 deletion are dependent
on hematopoietic cells, amplified in females, and eliminated in rats lacking phagocytic NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2).
These exciting data indicate an unexpected, sex-dependent role of CD14 in the development of salt-sensitive
hypertension and renal damage. This proposal will test the hypothesis that the anti-hypertensive effects of
CD14 in macrophages in the kidney lead to decreased activation of T cells in the kidney, attenuated salt-sensitive
hypertension, and decreased renal end-organ damage. The hypothesis will be addressed in three specific aims.
Aim 1 will address the hypothesis that the protective effects of CD14 against salt-sensitive hypertension and
associated renal damage involve inhibition of TLR4-mediated signaling in macrophages. Aim 2 will address the
hypothesis that elevated NOX2 in macrophages mediate elevated blood pressure in Dahl SS rats fed high salt,
an effect attenuated in females by CD14 and amplified in males by TLR4. Aim 3 will address the hypothesis that
the pro-hypertensive effects of TLR4 and the anti-hypertensive effects of CD14 are mediated by corresponding
changes in pressure natriuresis-diuresis and intrarenal hemodynamics in a process dependent upon free radicals
released from NOX2 in macrophages and T cells. The proposal employs in vitro and in vivo approaches to
address the hypothesis using unique, genetically-engineered rat strains developed for this grant, novel immune
cell transfer approaches, and state-of-the art methodology to assess hemodynamic variables in conscious rats."

 Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of hospitalization among Americans ≥65 years old with 5.7 million
sufferers and an annual of ~$39.2 billion. Patients with HF suffer from shortness of breath, fatigue and exercise
intolerance. Improving VO2peak is an important clinical goal in HF as it is correlated with reduced mortality rate
and increased quality of life. Exercise rehabilitation is considered class IA recommendation for people with HF,
with guidelines recommending moderate-intensity aerobic modalities, often in conjunction with resistance
training (AT+RT). A key limitation of these guidelines is that they arise largely from data involving a patient
cohort sometimes two decades younger (range 51-81 yrs) than the median age of diagnosis for HF (77 yrs).
Considering that older adults with HF experience a high prevalence of co-morbidities, impaired functional
capacity, reduced muscle mass and strength, and a 5-year survival of 25%, it is unclear whether the current
exercise guidelines can be tolerated by and generate functional benefits by a majority real-world HF patients.
 It is well accepted that impairments in peripheral tissues including; decreased muscle blood flow, decreased
muscle mass, and abnormal muscle metabolism have a significant contribution to the reduced exercise capacity
in patients with HF. In fact, many older patients with HF exhibit the sequelae of sarcopenia, which independently
carries an ominous prognosis. Accordingly, we have developed and pilot tested the “Peripheral Remodelling
via Intermitted Muscular Exercise” (PRIME) approach. PRIME offers a low mass, high repetition, localised
stimulus to peripheral muscles and tissues, without imposing central cardiorespiratory strain. In an exploratory
study which informed the current proposal, 19 subjects with HFrEF (>65yr, VO2peak=13.5ml/kg/min) increased
VO2peak, anaerobic threshold and maximal strength with 4 weeks of PRIME followed by 4 weeks of AT+RT. The
“control” group performed AT+RT for the whole 8 weeks and only increased maximal strength.
 We propose to expand on this promising data to definitively determine in an intent-to-treat trial enrolling 92
patients with HFrEF randomized to either: (A) 4 weeks of PRIME followed by 8 weeks of AT+RT, or: (B) 12
weeks of AT+RT. Data at baseline and following the 12-week interventions will be used to determine; (Aim1)
group changes in VO2peak during maximal cycle exercise (secondary clinical outcomes of muscle strength and
activities of daily living); (Aim2) group changes in central and peripheral hemodynamics and tissue perfusion.
Exploratory aims will examine blood markers of CHF severity, questionnaires for quality of life and skeletal
muscle mediators of VO2peak (opt-in biopsy). We will perform a 6-month post training assessment for durability
of any changes in fitness and function.
 This study represents an important step in closing the age-bias seen in clinical exercise studies. If PRIME is
shown to benefit elderly patients with HFrEF it may better inform exercise rehabilitation guidelines for these
individuals."

Coordinated specialty care (CSC) is the standard of care for early psychosis in the US. Supported by the 5-
10% set-aside in the Community Mental Health Block Grant program, targeted at evidence-based early
interventions, approximately 350 CSC programs have been implemented in 49 states across the US.
Neighborhoods where individuals reside are important determinants of health and the majority of the extant
work on neighborhood-level determinants and early psychosis has focused on the impact on individual-level
factors such as the incidence and onset of psychosis, and duration of untreated psychosis, but very few
studies have examined neighborhood-level characteristics as barrier to seeking services for early psychosis.
Research has highlighted the importance of mental health services being available in proximity
to an individual’s community, yet very little is known about the spatial distribution and accessibility of CSC
programs in the US. There is a clear gap in what we know about the potential difficulties accessing CSC
programs and whether the geographical placement and distribution of CSC programs contributes to
inequities. To address this gap, our overarching goal of the proposed study is to characterize CSC programs
and understand the geographical distribution and inequities in access to CSC programs. We will create
a novel integrative multi-level geospatial database of CSC programs implemented throughout the US, that
will include client-level data (race, ethnicity, age, gender), program-level data (geocoded location, capacity,
size, setting, payment, role availability), provider-level data (race, ethnicity, professional credentials), and
neighborhood-level census data (residential segregation, ethnic density, area deprivation, rural-urban
continua, broadband internet subscription, public transit time). Our specific aims are to 1) Characterize the
variations in facility-level characteristics of CSC programs by geographical location; 2) Examine geographic
availability and accessibility of CSC programs based on neighborhood-level characteristics; and 3) Develop
an interactive dashboard, using web-mapping technology, that will enable decision makers and community
stakeholders to identify areas with poor access to CSC programs. The proposed research represents a novel
application of advanced spatial analytics that will advance understanding on geographic inequities and
accessibility of CSC programs, which can used to inform policy and the future implementation of CSC
programs in high-need areas with limited access."
10878979,"We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of an
intervention designed to increase and improve equitable naloxone distribution in 48 syringe service programs
(SSPs) throughout California. In the past 5 years, opioid overdose mortality rates increased 114% among
Black, 97% among Latinx, and 32% among White populations. Opioid overdose fatalities are preventable with
the timely administration of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, yet our research has shown that Black and Latinx
people who inject drugs (PWID) are 25% and 47% less likely, respectively, to receive naloxone than White
PWID. Building on pilot work (R21DA046703; Principal Investigator: Lambdin), we will use the Systems
Analysis and Improvement Approach to improve equitable access to naloxone from SSPs (SAIA-Naloxone). In
our pilot study with two SSPs in California, we found that SAIA-Naloxone led to an average increase of 23
more people receiving naloxone (p<0.001) and 64 more naloxone doses bein g distributed (p<0.001) per week.
We observed a 116% increase in naloxone distribution to participants who were Black, Indigenous, or People
of Color (BIPOC). SAIA-Naloxone was feasible and acceptable, and it resulted in meaningful improvements in
naloxone penetration. We are now proposing to test SAIA-Naloxone in a large-scale randomized controlled
trial. To effectively address opioid overdoses, SSP-based naloxone programs must engage participants in a
series of sequential steps including screening participants; training them in naloxone administration;
distributing naloxone; and building systems that support participants to possess naloxone, use naloxone during
overdose events, and obtain naloxone refills as needed. This paradigm is known as the naloxone delivery
cascade. SAIA-Naloxone is a multicomponent implementation strategy designed to help SSPs identify and
address weaknesses along the naloxone delivery cascade. It includes determination of drop-offs in cascade
delivery, process mapping and consensus discussions to identify potential solutions, and continuous quality
improvement. Our Aim 1 is to test the effectiveness of SAIA-Naloxone on improving naloxone distribution at
SSPs, relative to treatment as usual. Aim 2 is to test the effectiveness of SAIA-Naloxone on improving
naloxone distribution at SSPs to BIPOC participants, relative to treatment as usual. Aim 3 is to estimate the
cost and cost-effectiveness of SAIA-Naloxone on improving equitable access to naloxone at syringe service
programs, relative to treatment as usual. This project will directly contribute to the improvement of minority
health and the reduction of health disparities. The proposed study aligns with the goals of the Department of
Health and Human Services and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which
recognize naloxone access as our nation’s first defense to prevent opioid overdose deaths."

 Centrioles are conserved cellular organelles that template cilia for mediating cell signaling and motility,
and recruit pericentriolar material to nucleate microtubules as part of the centrosome. Centrioles are extremely
stable structures that persist over multiple cell cycles, and centriole number is controlled to ensure that each
daughter cell inherits exactly two centrioles from its mother. Defects in centrosome and cilium function have
been linked to a wide range of diseases, including cancer, microcephaly, and a set of syndromes known as
ciliopathies.
 Within a centrosome, the older centriole in the pair templates the cilium, and together they form the
centriole-cilium complex. Key features of this complex are the compound microtubules, which are a unique
arrangement of microtubules linked together: three linked microtubules form the centriolar triplets, and two
form the ciliary doublets. These compound microtubules occur only in the centriole-cilium complex, and are
required for the structural integrity of the centriole and for protein trafficking in the cilium. Though the
morphology of compound microtubules has long been appreciated, little is known about the mechanisms by
which these microtubules form specifically at the centriole-cilium complex. In my postdoctoral work, I found that
two members of the tubulin superfamily, delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin, are required for the centriolar triplet
microtubules. The means by which these proteins act are unknown.
 Here, I propose to determine the mechanisms of compound microtubule formation through an
integrated set of aims. Spanning both the mentored and independent phases, these aims will allow me to test
the relative contributions of microtubule protofilaments themselves, as well as other proteins including delta-
tubulin and epsilon-tubulin, to compound microtubule formation and stability. With the help of an outstanding
collaborator and mentor team, I will train in research techniques, as well as skills for my career development.
Together, this will create a strong foundation for an independent research career in understanding the roles of
microtubule structures in human development and health."
10879108,"Pathological stresses, such as pressure overload in the left ventricles of patients with hypertension and aortic
valve stenosis, cause cardiac hypertrophy, a major risk factor of congestive heart failure. Hypertrophic and
failing hearts shift substrate utilization preference from fatty acids to glucose, ketone bodies, and others.
However, the interplay between the energetic state and the mitochondrial/metabolic remodeling in the
hypertrophic and failing remains incompletely understood. Most of the past studies are based on models with
confounding conditions. F1Fo-ATP synthase is an essential enzyme complex that generates ATP in
mitochondria, thus playing a central role in cellular energetics. Genetic defects of F1Fo-ATP synthase are rare
but deadly because of dilated cardiomyopathy and neuromuscular disorders. How those patients with partial
F1Fo-ATP synthase deficiencies respond to pathological stresses is unclear. It is documented that F1Fo-ATP
synthase is impaired in pathological hearts from patients and animals. Our recent study revealed that
enhancing F1Fo-ATP synthase structure/function using gene therapy restored cardiac function in the
hypertrophied hearts, corroborating the concept of targeting F1Fo-ATP synthase as a novel protective therapy
for heart failure. Our prior studies demonstrated that mice lacking F1Fo-ATP synthase assembly factors, such
as ATPAF1, lead to F1Fo-ATP synthase deficiencies with cardiomyopathy. Therefore, our central hypothesis is
that enhancing F1Fo-ATP synthase capacity to facilitate ATP production efficiency will mitigate
mitochondrial disorders and the ensued cardiac hypertrophy and failure. We propose to test the central
hypothesis with two aims. In aim 1, we will test that the F1Fo-ATP synthase deficiency is an amendable
pathogenic factor in heart failure progression. Experiments will provide evidence to support that partial F1Fo-
ATP synthase deficiency contributes to the pathological progression of heart failure, and gene therapies
correcting the deficiency will slow the heart failure progression. In aim 2, we will define how F1Fo-ATP
synthase capacities directly correlate to mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolic remodeling in
cardiomyocytes of the adult heart. Therefore, this proposed project will provide definitive evidence to support
innovative gene therapy and define the underpinning mechanisms. The proposed study will yield novel insights
into the primary mechanisms underlying metabolic remodeling in cardiac pathological hypertrophy progression.
The preclinical animal study will lay the groundwork for innovative gene therapies, which will significantly
impact patient care."
10879109,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The project aims to assess the effectiveness, health benefits, and cost and obtain information to inform scale-
up and sustainability ofa novel pediatric HIV disclosure intervention (“Sankofa”) among dyads of caregivers
and children 7-18 years of age (who do not know their HIV diagnosis) in Ghana. This area of investigation is
profoundly understudied and of high importance to millions of children and their families in sub-Saharan
Africa. While widely recognized as vital to better health outcomes, especially in the era of better access to
HIV treatment, many children are not informed of their HIV diagnosis. A variety of socio-cultural contextual
barriers and deficient skills drive the persistent reluctance of caregivers and health care providers to inform
children of the diagnosis. We developed a clinic-based disclosure intervention delivered as an integral
component of routine care. The intervention, `Sankofa', is guided by an HIV pediatric disclosure model that
incorporates bioecological systems theory and core elements of the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills
(IMB) model of Health Behavior Change. The intervention is the first randomized trial to evaluate the effect of a
structured disclosure intervention on disclosure of HIV status to children. At one year (primary endpoint),
51.4% of children in the Sankofa group had been disclosed to versus 16.2% in the control (p<0.001). While
highly promising, the Sankofa intervention has only been examined in a single site under optimal conditions.
In this study, we aim to build upon the successful Sankofa trial by testing the intervention in a larger scale
study delivered in “real-world” clinic conditions over time in Ghana. We will conduct a pragmatic, stepped
wedge cluster randomized trial in 12 HIV pediatric clinics in Ghana to determine effectiveness, health benefits,
cost and obtain information to inform scale-up and sustainability. We will recruit dyads of 720 children (ages 7-
18) and their caregivers. We propose the following specific aims: (1) To examine the effectiveness of the
Sankofa pediatric disclosure intervention in the presence of “real-world” clinic conditions in Ghana; (2) Assess
health benefits and cost-effectiveness of the Sankofa pediatric disclosure intervention-assisted disclosure as it
pertains to medication adherence and health outcomes of children (virologic, immunologic, psychosocial,
behavioral) and the caregiver (psychosocial); and (3) To explore factors associated with effective
implementation and maintenance of the Sankofa pediatric disclosure intervention in the presence of “real-
world” clinic conditions in Ghana. Our findings will further a scientific understanding of the mechanisms of
action, cost, and individual (child and caregiver)- and organizational-level facilitators and barriers to effective
and sustainable delivery of the intervention in a variety of clinical settings."
10879112,"ABSTRACT
 Human cells respond to xenobiotic exposures by altering gene expression, with the ~50 RNA modifications
comprising the epitranscriptome emerging as key regulators of the stress response. We have developed unique
RNA modification detection (LC-MS/MS, AQRNA-seq), tRNA gene expression (AQRNA-seq), and computational
(Codon Analytics) technologies to show that yeast, rat livers, mice and cultured human cells respond to
xenobiotic exposures with coordinated changes in the levels of tRNA modifications and tRNAs, to
regulate codon-biased translation of important stress response proteins. Using liver from rats exposed to
six drugs and toxicants in the NTP DrugMatrix program, we observed that 23 different tRNA modifications were
uniquely altered in toxicant-, dose- and time-dependent manner after exposure. Among the changes, arsenite
increased the level of queuosine (Q), a key tRNA wobble modification that decodes codons for four amino
acids (His, Tyr, Asn, Asp). This behavior was recapitulated in human liver cells (HEPG2), with Q incorporation
into tRNA in response to sodium arsenite required for cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification,
and mitochondrial function, and decreased Q levels promoting changes in translation. Similarly, the wobble U
tRNA wobble base 5-methoxycarbonyl-methyluridine (mcm5U) was also increased in response to sodium
arsenite in rat liver and HepG2 cells, with knockdown of the corresponding wobble U writer – ALKBH8 –
promoting decreased cell viability, increased ROS, and changes in mitochondrial function. We have further
shown that ALKBH8 defects disrupt the translation of selenocysteine (Sec)-containing glutathione peroxidases
(GPXs) that detoxify ROS and promote mitochondrial function. In this renewal application, we will test the
hypothesis of organ-specific tRNA reprogramming and codon-biased translation in rats and human cells
exposed to arsenite and other toxicants, and then test the idea that whole blood and white blood cells
(WBCs) serve as an accessible sampling compartment for human epitranscriptome biomarker studies."
10877369,"Project Summary/Abstract
The overarching goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the initiating mechanisms in the development of
cancer-prone chronic inflammation for cancer prevention and therapy. Chronic inflammatory diseases, such as
chronic dermatitis, pancreatitis, colitis and hepatitis, are major risk factors for cancer. In addition, a tumor-
promoting immune environment, which resembles chronic inflammation, is a key driver of cancer development
across the majority of cancer types. By studying the mediators of the transition from acute to chronic
inflammation, we have demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-33 cytokine is a key initiator of chronic inflammation
that eventually leads to cancer development in the skin, colon and pancreas. Importantly, we have recently
discovered that the nuclear function of IL-33 within the epithelial cells plays an essential role in cancer
development in chronic skin and pancreas inflammation. To develop an effective strategy to suppress cancer-
prone chronic inflammation, we will focus on the mechanism that blocks the initiating steps in the development
of a cancer-prone chronic inflammation. Founded on our innovative discovery that IL-33 is an essential initiator
of cancer-prone chronic inflammation, we aim to determine the mechanism of IL-33 induction in tissues exposed
to inflammatory insults and to develop a novel therapeutic approach to inhibit IL-33 expression for cancer
prevention and therapy. To accomplish this, we will use novel mouse models and clinical samples to (1)
determine the mechanism of IL-33 induction in chronic inflammation triggered by chemical agents, (2) investigate
the role of IL-33 in cancer-prone chronic inflammation associated with a viral infection, and (3) study inhibitor of
IL-33 that can block chronic inflammation and the subsequent cancer development. The outcomes of our
research will establish a fundamental pathway to suppress chronic inflammation-associated cancer and provide
the means to prevent cancer progression and recurrence."
10876230,"Once prostate cancer progresses to an advanced castration resistant stage it becomes an incurable deadly
disease. To date the understanding of the intrinsic tumor cell biology processes involved in the pathobiology of
lethal prostate cancer remains limited. Our research proposal aims to elucidate actionable molecular
mechanisms that sustain the aggressiveness of lethal tumors by using clinically significant human prostate
cancer models. Work from our laboratory and others have revealed that master regulator transcription factors
regulate actionable mechanisms that dynamically reprogram the cancer cell by regulating the expression of key
nuclear growth factor receptors of prostate cancer such as the Androgen receptor. Through the comprehensive
analysis of human transcriptomic prostate cancer public databases that include primary and metastatic tissue
samples, coupled with in vitro and in vivo patient derived experimental models, we have identified
transcriptionally regulating mechanisms associated with the pathobiology of lethal prostate cancer. Most relevant
to this proposal, our studies point to a key role of the Microphthalmia Transcription Factor (MITF) in advanced
lethal prostate cancer. Low MITF levels are associated with lethal prostate cancer and disease relapse in primary
prostate cancer patients. Notably, functional studies suggest that in prostate cancer MITF regulates the growth
and confers resistance to androgen deprivation therapy by controlling a distinct clinically relevant gene network.
Indeed, computational studies suggest that MITF regulates the protein synthesis of specific key oncoproteins
and prostate specific growth factors, such as MYC and AR. Thus, based on these results, we hypothesize that
MITF contributes to the pathogenesis of lethal prostate cancer by regulating both transcriptional and translational
mechanisms that reprogram the cancer cell into a therapy resistant lethal state. We will investigate this
hypothesis as follows: In aim 1 we will explore the MITF regulated transcriptional mechanisms associated with
lethal prostate cancer, focusing on distinct MITF isoforms to delineate their individual functions, as well as
determine the clinically relevant MITF regulated downstream effector genes. In aim 2 we will examine how MITF
regulates protein synthesis, focusing on specific translation initiation subunits to determine their function in
regulating the translation of specific mRNAs, as well as regulatory crosstalk between MITF and MYC. Finally, in
aim 3 we will study the clinical relevance of these findings in circulating tumor cells from lethal prostate cancer
patients along with testing the in vivo efficacy in preclinical models of targeting protein synthesis together with
androgen deprivation therapy as a combined therapeutic strategy to delay the development of castration
resistance in low MITF prostate tumors. Ultimately, these studies are poised to broaden our understanding of
how master regulator transcription factors govern an intricate complex signaling network that rewires the cancer
cell, in this case through regulation of translation, which may offer novel druggable therapeutic opportunities for
prostate cancer patients."
10876233,"Use of Clinical Samples to Identify Influenza Virus Antigenic Variants
Summary
 Influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause pandemic and seasonal outbreaks that lead to the loss of thousands to
millions of human lives. Vaccination is the best option for preventing influenza outbreaks and minimizing their
effects. An understanding of the antigenic evolution of influenza viruses and the rapid selection of a well-
matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, antigenic
characterization for influenza viruses presents two great challenges: 1) virus propagation, which is required in
conventional serologic assays, can cause culture-adapted mutations and skew antigenic properties of viruses
in clinical samples, and 2) reference sera used in conventional serologic assays are produced in influenza
virus–seronegative ferrets and do not represent the immunologic profiles of human serum, which often has had
prior exposures to influenza viruses through vaccination, natural infection, or both. An ideal platform for
determining antigenic properties of influenza viruses and for selecting influenza vaccine strain should directly
use clinical samples.
 The objectives of this project are 1) to develop and apply a novel high-throughput technology to directly
characterize antigenic properties of influenza viruses by using human clinical samples without virus isolation
and propagation and 2) to understand antigenic evolution of IAVs by using clinical samples directly. The
antigenic characterization will include influenza virus–positive clinical samples from which virus can or cannot
be cultivated. To understand influenza virus quasispecies in clinical samples and the effect of culture-adapted
mutations on antigenic characterization, we will perform next-generation genomic sequencing on the clinical
samples and corresponding isolates. We will then study the effects of the sequence diversity on antigenic
variations of influenza viruses. We will also determine the effect that prior exposure to influenza virus(es) has
on antigenic characterization during influenza vaccine strain selection.
 This project will help us provide fundamental technology for characterizing the antigenicity of influenza
viruses in clinical samples without propagating virus. The resulting platform for antigenic characterization will
overcome biases arising from virus propagation in conventional serologic assays. In addition, this is a high-
throughput method and will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serologic characterization,
decrease the time required for antigenic characterization, and increase the number of samples in antigenic
characterization. Thus, this project will lead to significant technologic advances in influenza vaccine strain
selection and facilitate influenza prevention and control. In addition, this project will provide knowledge about
molecular mechanisms in antigenic variations associated with influenza virus quasispecies and genomic
diversity and knowledge about prior human exposure to influenza viruses, which will help us optimize antigenic
characterization in vaccine strain selection and understand antigenic evolution of influenza viruses."

Project Summary
The Neurotechnology & Fabrication Core will support the successful design and generation of custom-built
products and devices for data collection in vision research laboratories at Yale. The Core combines two
services. A Neurotechnology service will provide consultation on experimental apparatus requirements
followed by assistance with either purchasing decisions or custom devise design and implementation as
warranted. The Support Scientist, a Neurotechnology Engineer, would also provide users with training
within a state-of-the-art design and fabrication facility that includes machining, electronic and prototyping
tools; design and fabrication of scientific instrumentation that allows interfacing with microscopes, lasers
and computers; and would create a nexus for technology transfer between vision research laboratories. The
second service would be a conventional Machine Shop, where a machinist would offer complementary
services for standard machining solutions for the design, production and repair of scientific equipment for
vision research. The combined services in this Core module would provide Vision Core investigators with
important resources that are difficult or impossible to obtain elsewhere. First, the module provides speedy,
priority services (including emergency repairs) in support of specialized vision research experimental
apparatus in a range of different materials. Second, it provides professional advice and assistance
(including in-lab consultation) of experienced staff who have extensive knowledge of the design and
fabrication of specialized equipment for vision research. The close physical proximity of the
Neurotechnology facility and Machine Shop to Vision Core investigator laboratories, as well as the
familiarity of the staff with the equipment in these laboratories, makes this module a critical component of
the Vision Core Program at Yale."
10882186,"The foreign body response (FBR) induced by the implantation of synthetic biomaterials remains a formidable
challenge. The FBR begins as an inflammatory process that is mediated by innate immune cells and culminates
in the production of an avascular fibrous capsule. While the FBR has been extensively studied, a detailed
understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the FBR remains elusive. The current dogma assumes
that the FBR is driven by proteins that adsorb and unfold irreversibly on biomaterial surfaces. However, using
novel single-molecule methods, we have shown that adsorption and unfolding on surfaces is highly dynamic and
reversible, and that proteins in contact with surfaces desorb rapidly in both the folded and unfolded states. This
newfound understanding paints a different picture, which suggests that otherwise non-inflammatory proteins
contribute to the production of soluble damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that accumulate in the
fluid surrounding an implant. Our preliminary in vitro studies found a direct link between surface-induced
transiently unfolded fibronectin and the activation of macrophages, whereas surfaces that stabilized folded
fibronectin were less inflammatory. Our in vivo studies found that Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and 4, which
recognize DAMPs, are the main drivers of the FBR. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this research is to
investigate the mechanistic basis for the events that trigger and sustain the FBR by linking protein dynamics,
DAMPs, myeloid cell activation, and the FBR. Using a highly multi-disciplinary approach, we will test the
hypothesis that continuous production of soluble DAMPs due to rapid unfolding, slow re-folding, and
desorption of proteins from the surface of an implant sustains the FBR, and that modulating such protein
dynamics to stabilize the non-inflammatory folded state weakens the FBR. To test this hypothesis, the
specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) determine the impact and nature of protein dynamics on DAMP
production and their impact on myeloid cell activation (Aim 1), (2) identify universal brush chemistries that
weaken myeloid cell activation by generally controlling protein-brush interactions (Aim 2), and (3) evaluate
polymer brushes as coatings for implants to weaken the FBR in vivo and in human cells (Aim 3). To carry out
the proposed research, our team will combine innovative single-molecule methods, protein engineering, tunable
surface chemistries, and molecular dynamic simulations with machine learning to understand the protein-
biomaterial interface and to identify novel surface chemistries that provide generalized control over protein
dynamics in complex protein solutions. We will study the role of protein dynamics on neutrophils and
macrophages and utilize mouse models with mutant TLRs to link the protein-biomaterial interface to DAMPs and
to the FBR. Completion of this project will provide a mechanistic basis for the role of protein dynamics in the
FBR and lead to the discovery of new surface chemistries with improved biocompatibility. Such outcomes will
provide the framework to prevent the FBR and improve clinical translation of implantable biomaterials."
10873772,"Pediatric hydrocephalus affects 400,000 new children annually around the world. The primary etiology in the
developed world is neonatal post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH), affecting around 1 in 16 premature
babies born at less than 29 weeks. Arising from the initial insult of intraventricular hemorrhage, subsequent
neuroinflammation, and disruption of the choroid plexus epithelium, PHH is manifested by progressive
ventricular dilation and increased intracranial pressure. PHH that can lead to significant disability and even
death.
The incomplete and evolving understanding of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics limit the development
of improved strategies to prevent and treat PHH. Traditional bulk CSF flow models consider hydrocephalus to
be a plumbing problem with a mismatch in the rate of CSF generation and extracranial outflow. Several
preclinical studies have shown that neuroinflammation disrupts CSF-lymphatic extracranial outflow. We
hypothesize that in infants with PHH, impaired extracranial CSF outflow into the peripheral lymphatics
contributes to a vicious cycle of increasing neuroinflammation that may be responsible for initial treatment
failures and progressive insults that ensure irreversible brain injury.
In this pilot project, we will deploy a new technique, called fluorescence, cap-based transcranial optical
tomography (fCTOT) to understand the relationship between ventricular and lymphatic CSF dynamics,
measures of neuroinflammation, and outcomes to standard-of-care CSF diversion as well as endoscopic third
ventriculostomy and choroid plexus coagulation. Our specific aims are to:
(1) Conduct point-of-care, fCTOT imaging of ventricular Inodcyanine green (ICG)-CSF dynamics in infants with
 progressing PHH;
(2) Measure ICG-CSF clearance into lymph/blood from point-of-care, non-invasive diffuse reflectance
 measurements using NIRF-LI; and
(3) Correlate fCTOT-derived ICG-CSF dynamics, ICG-CSF clearance into lymph/blood, and CSF biomarkers
 of inflammation with treatment outcomes.
If successful, this application will provide novel, critical information on the role of CSF dynamics for the
development of future prevention, progression, and treatment strategies for PHH. The study will be co-directed
by Manish Shah, MD, a neurosurgeon overseeing the care of a large PHH patient population; by Eva Sevick,
PhD., a biomedical engineer and early pioneer of near-infrared fluorescence optical tomography; and by
Banghe Zhu, PhD., an optical engineer who translated a non-contrast versus CTOT for rapid, whole-brain
tomography of PHH infants."
10873775,"Project Summary
tRNA fragments (tRFs) defend the host against mobile genetic elements and function in RNA silencing. We
found that 3'-derived tRNA fragments (3'-tRFs) inhibit long terminal repeat (LTR)-retroelements, which use the
3'-end of tRNAs to prime reverse transcription at their highly conserved primer binding site (PBS). 3'-tRFs are
highly expressed in cancer and stem cells supporting our central hypothesis that 3'-tRFs protect the genome
from transposon damage during epigenetic reprogramming in development and disease. Our rationale is that 3'-
tRF mediated inhibition of LTR-retroelements is highly conserved and is an ancient link between transposons,
RNA interference (RNAi), and genome stability. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine key factors
involved in this novel small RNA silencing mechanism and how they intersect with the RNAi pathway. First, we
will develop reporter assays for the most highly active endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in the mouse, IAP and
ETn/MusD, which will resolve the timing of retrotransposition and be suitable for screening for proteins that
mediate silencing by tRFs. We hypothesize that 3'-tRFs protect the preimplantation embryo in the absence of
epigenetic repression of ERVs, similar to piRNAs in the germline, and we will test the in vivo impact of tRFs in
mouse preimplantation embryos after pronuclear injection of luminescence-based ERV reporters. To dissect the
role of RNAi proteins in 3'-tRF silencing, we will determine tRF expression, subcellular localization,
retrotransposition rates, and diagnostic retroviral intermediates during candidate knock-down and knock-out.
Catalytically deficient RNAi mutants will help resolve the role of these enzymes in 3'-tRF biogenesis versus
binding and target recognition. Lastly, we will use RNA-protein pull-downs and a targeted CRISPR knock-out
screen that scores for retrotransposition to identify novel RNA-binding proteins that function in 3'-tRF silencing
of mobile elements. Repressive chromatin marks and full-length tRNA levels in the same cells will complete the
picture. 3'-tRF biogenesis and silencing are at the root of a cellular decision whether to keep tRNAs for translation
- and retroelement replication - or produce tRFs to inhibit them. Expression of LTR-retroelements not only
threaten genome stability, but murine and human ERVs that are targeted by 3'-tRFs are also essential for stem
cell pluripotency. Therefore, it is of high priority to determine the mechanism and scope of retroelement regulation
by tRFs. Targeting of the PBS by 3'-tRFs is a unique vulnerability of this highly abundant and dispersed class of
mobile elements and might enable innovative approaches towards treatment of infectious LTR-retroviruses, such
as HIV. Understanding to what extent tRNAs are a substrate of the RNAi pathway will add novel perspective to
the arms race between mobile elements and their hosts."

UNAIDS estimates the global population of children under 15 years of age HIV-exposed yet uninfected (CHEU)
approached 15 million in 2018, and each year more than 1 million newborns continue to be HIV-exposed
uninfected, the overwhelming majority of whom reside in low- and middle-income countries. Evolving public
health responses have contributed to the heterogeneity of in utero exposures for CHEU. As the HIV epidemic
has matured, pregnant women living with HIV (WLHIV) are accessing more potent antiretroviral regimens prior
to and during pregnancy. While this has dramatically reduced infant HIV acquisition, safety monitoring of
antiretroviral treatment (ART) in pregnancy has been limited. Even with exposure heterogeneity, both children
and youth HEU continue to experience higher risk for poorer outcomes compared with children HIV-unexposed
and uninfected (CHUU). Our work and the work of others has shown increased risk of infectious morbidity,
mortality, poorer growth, altered metabolic health, and neurobehavioral delays and deficits. It is imperative that
modifiable biological, social, and structural mechanisms driving these disparities be identified to inform
interventions. Botswana has the 2nd highest prevalence of HIV worldwide. Yet, it was the first country in sub-
Saharan Africa to provide free ART to its citizens including pregnant women, leading the continent in the
response to the HIV epidemic and in adoption of new ARVs, including dolutegravir. Concurrently, Botswana –
Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership (BHP) has been conducting cutting-edge research involving pregnant WLHIV
and their children since 2001 when the Mashi study (R01HD37793) opened. We have captured uniform and
harmonized data, including obstetric and maternal ART information, infant birth data, infant antiretroviral (ARV)
prophylaxis type and duration, infant duration of breast and/or formula feeding and other socioeconomic data.
Our curated database contains information on >5,000 CHEU. Leveraging our robust database, we will establish
the FLOURISH cohort (Following Longitudinal Outcomes to Understand, Report, Intervene, and Sustain Health
of Infants, Children and Adolescents who are HIV-Exposed Uninfected) of 1,575 child/adolescent-caregiver pairs
(1100 CHEU, 475 CHUU). The FLOURISH cohort will enable us to evaluate differences in rates of infectious
morbidity and all-cause mortality between CHEU and CHUU up to 3 years of age. Among school-aged children
(6-10 years of age), we will assess whether in utero HIV/ARV exposure among CHEU is associated with
differences in neurobehavioral functioning compared with CHUU. Lastly, among children ≥ 10 years of age, we
will assess associations between in utero HIV/ARV exposure and cardiometabolic risk factors using age, sex,
and body mass index (BMI)-frequency matched CHUU as a comparator. The rich breadth of well-characterized
seminal BHP studies will provide a robust platform from which key scientific questions regarding life course

 Intermittent parathyroid hormone (PTH) by daily injection increases bone formation, whereas continuous
PTH causes bone resorption and limits its therapeutic value. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that
promote both the beneficial anabolic PTH actions and the problematic adverse effects is critical to improving the
therapeutic efficacy of PTH-based treatments. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an important role in
regulating and controlling bone metabolism. The type 1 PTH receptor (PTHR) desensitizes in response to brief
exposure to PTH and sustained treatment with PTH downregulates the PTHR in osteoblasts. It is unknown
whether continuous PTH-caused bone loss is mediated through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In studies
supported by an NIAMS R03 grant, we determined that continuous PTH treatment induces PTHR ubiquitination
and degradation, thereby inhibiting osteoblast differentiation and promoting osteoclast resorptive activity. In
addition, PTH activates multiple signaling pathways but not all of them are anabolic. Recent data from others
and our group have demonstrated that beta-catenin interacts with the PTHR carboxyl-terminal region and
switches PTHR signaling from Gs/cAMP to Gq/PLC activation. Furthermore, our preliminary data show that
ixazomib, a newly approved oral proteasome inhibitor with less toxicity, is able to block continuous PTH-induced
PTHR proteasomal degradation and reverse PTHR signaling switch by dissociating beta-catenin from the PTHR.
Based on these findings, we hypothesize that ixazomib is capable of converting the catabolic effect of continuous
PTH to an anabolic effect by blocking PTHR degradation and dissociating beta-catenin. The goals of our
proposed studies are to: 1) establish the proof-of-principle that inhibition of PTHR downregulation and PTHR
interaction with beta-catenin renders continuous PTHR activation more effective in promoting bone formation;
and 2) generate important pre-clinical data assessing the efficacy, safety, and side effects of ixazomib in our
murine model of continuous PTH-mediated bone loss. Three specific aims are developed to test this hypothesis
and achieve these goals, employing independent and complementary strategies. Aim 1 will detail how ixazomib
rescues continuous PTH-induced PTHR catabolic signaling. In Aim 2, we will establish whether ixazomib
converts continuous PTH catabolic effect to bone anabolism in vivo. Aim 3 will characterize mechanisms by
which ixazomib reverses the osteocatabolic effect of continuous PTH in vitro. Successful completion of the
proposed research will greatly advance our understanding of the mechanisms that promote/limit PTH effects on
bone formation, and provide strong basic and preclinical data that will clarify the path to a more effective
osteoporosis treatment."

Doctors of Veterinary Medicine (DVMs) are uniquely qualified to conduct biomedical research in the field of
comparative medicine using animal models. Unfortunately, the majority of DVMs do not pursue research-
related careers, partly due to the lack of research training opportunities. Consequently, there is a critical
shortage of veterinarians with research backgrounds conducting biomedical research across the nation. This
proposed “Animal Model Research for Veterinarians” (AMRV) program will train veterinarians to become world-
class researchers and pursue a research-related career after training. By taking advantage of the research
strengths of faculty mentors at Virginia Tech, the AMRV program will train veterinarians in areas including
animal models of immunology and inflammation, infectious diseases, and neuroscience. We will recruit from all
30 accredited veterinary medical schools in the nation, particularly from Tuskegee University with the objective
of recruiting underrepresented minorities. A total of six DVMs will be recruited into the Virginia Tech’s
Biomedical and Veterinary Sciences (BMVS) PhD program over the entire 5-year funding period of the
program. We will recruit one new trainee each year in years 1 and 3-5, and two new trainees in year 2.
Mentors will be selected based on their commitment to student training, their cutting-edge research programs,
and their ability to secure NIH and other major federal funding. In addition to the Virginia-Maryland College of
Veterinary Medicine (VMCVM), opportunities for trainees to work at the Edward Via College of Osteopathic
Medicine (VCOM) and the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute (FBRI) at Virginia Tech Carilion School of
Medicine will increase opportunities for studying animal models of human diseases and conduct translational
medicine research. Our trainees will also be exposed to cutting-edge interdisciplinary collaborations of our
faculty with researchers at other colleges (Engineering, Sciences, and Agricultural and Life Sciences). A
unique feature of this program will be a visit to NIH, USDA, FDA, and other federal agencies in the
Washington, DC area so that AMRV trainees can understand the breadth of research-related career
opportunities available to them. Also, each week in the summer, in our complementary training program (T35),
we bring in DVM/PhD scientists from the federal government, medical schools, biotech and biopharma, which
will give additional opportunities for our T32 trainees to network with these scientists. The training plan includes
courses in research ethics, methodology, grant writing, and communications in science as well as opportunities
to present research at local and national conferences. All aspects of the training are focused on preparing
trainees to become independent biomedical researchers mostly in academia, but in industry and federal
government as well. Thus, this T32 AMRV program will enable VMCVM to continue to help train the next
generation of veterinary biomedical leaders in academia, federal government, and industry."

Understanding how cells fail to protect against the mutations and structural rearrangements that are found in
all cancers is critical to ultimately treating the disease. Mutant replication DNA polymerases are found in some
of the most highly mutated tumors known. These tumors also have a very unique mutation spectrum. In our
published work we generated and began to characterize mouse and human cell models of these tumors. While
it was originally thought that this mutagenesis was both necessary and sufficient for tumor development, our
published work and preliminary data strongly implicates additional factors as being necessary for POLE tumor
development.
The main goal of this project is to test our central hypothesis that while POLE tumors are some of the most
highly mutagenic tumors observed, the essential tumorigenic feature of POLE mutants is a failure to stabilize
stalled/collapsed replication forks in response to damaged DNA via inactivation of certain homology-directed
repair genes like BRCA2 and/or loss of a nuclear PTEN activity that both normally stabilize stalled replication
forks and thus suppress genome instability. POLE mutagenesis is concurrently enhanced by promoting
acquisition of mutations in these pathways This hypothesis is based on our published work and unpublished
preliminary evidence. Specifically, this project will 1) Define the mechanistic origins of POLE mutational
signatures; 2) Characterize the cooperation between POLE mutations and homology-directed repair genes, in
particular BRCA2; and 3) Characterize the interactions between a noncanonical PTEN mutant and POLE
mutant alleles.
The proposed work is significant because these studies linking POLE dysfunction to other dysregulated
pathways will provide novel insight into both basic mechanisms of genome instability, but also new possible
therapeutic approaches to treating replication-defective cancers. The work is also significant because it will
advance our understanding of synthetic lethality and neo-epitopes in immune checkpoint therapies. The
proposed work is innovative because 1) it is the first to identify genetic interactions between POLE mutant
alleles and other pathways in tumors and then characterize these interactions in a mammalian system; 2) we
will be the first to examine the effects of these interactions on genome stability and then compare to
sequencing information from large, publicly available cancer genome databases; 3) the proposed studies are
innovative in their use of CRISPR-based genetic engineering of multiple systems (mice, human cells,
organoids) for comparing effects on phenotype and mutagenesis."
10873829,"In recent years, developments in deep-sequencing-based genomic assays, single-cell technologies, and
machine learning methods have greatly improved our understanding of epigenetics and gene regulation, which
in turn has advanced our understanding of cell type differentiation and human disease. Recent studies have
begun to apply these techniques to understand how non-coding regulatory elements, such as enhancers and
insulators, contribute to infectious, autoinflammatory, and autoimmune diseases. Studies of the immune
system, especially hematopoiesis and genome-wide associations of autoimmune diseases and blood-cell
traits, have produced promising results, discovering unique enhancer landscapes of immune cell types and
identifying genetic variants with clinical relevance for prognosis and treatment of immune diseases. However,
many existing analyses are gene-centric and do not take advantage of regulatory information in non-coding
regions, leaving these data underutilized. An atlas of regulatory elements and their impact on molecular and
clinical phenotypes will greatly expand our understanding of the biology of immune-related diseases and has
the potential to expand precision medicine for predicting clinical outcomes and treatment pathways.
As members of the ENCODE project, we have developed the Registry of candidate cis-regulatory elements
(cCREs), a collection of roughly two million candidate enhancers, promoters, and insulators in the human
genome with activity profiles in more than 1500 human cell types, presented by a powerful web-based
knowledgebase SCREEN (screen.encodeproject.org). The Registry and SCREEN are powerful resources for
the study of non-coding elements, but they do not include any disease-specific data and are not designed to
take advantage of special features of immune data or immune-related disorders. Here, we propose to draw on
the wealth of genomic and epigenetic data from immune samples rapidly accumulating in the literature and
public repositories to build a data integration and visualization platform, iSCREEN, for supporting a wide range
of immune-mediated disease research. This project has three aims: Aim 1. Develop a web-based data
integration platform iSCREEN for immune cCREs and their cell-type-specific epigenetic signals with the goal of
predicting the impact of human genetic variants on immune traits; Aim 2. Build analysis and visualization tools
to map single-cell data onto the space of well-annotated immune cell types and integrate their annotations; and
Aim 3. Perform community outreach, expand our user base, and develop new computational tools and
visualizations to meet user needs."

Traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCI) involve serious neural damage events that can lead to long-term motor and
sensory deficits, as well as cognitive and emotional dysfunctions. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) are routinely used in the clinical management of SCI. However, neither method
provides physiological information of SCI progression and recovery. We propose to fill this gap by applying
quantitative PET imaging using our newly developed synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) radiotracer to track
the synaptic density changes and neuroplasticity over the disease course. Quantitative SV2A PET imaging has
been used to reveal the synaptic density changes in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer’s
disease, Parkinson’s disease, depression, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and stroke. Our pilot PET imaging studies
using the recently developed SV2A PET imaging agents indicate that SV2A PET could be used to quantify
synapse density in the spinal cord of rodents, monkeys, and human. Our pilot SV2A PET rodent imaging study
proved the feasibility of using SV2A PET to detect subtle synaptic loss at 10 days post moderate thoracic
contusion injury. Based on these preliminary results and literature evidence, we hypothesize that altered SV2A
level is a biomarker for neuroplasticity in SCI and SV2A PET can be used to facilitate the diagnose and prognosis
of SCI and to evaluate therapeutic effects in clinical trials. We propose to test the hypotheses through the
following aims: 1) to determine the expression levels and dynamics of synaptic markers in rodent model of SCI
over time, using molecular biology and quantitative in vitro imaging approach; 2) to validate SV2A PET imaging
in the SCI rodent model through small animal PET, ex vivo and in vitro assays and behavioral tests and to apply
SV2A PET imaging in the objective evaluation of therapeutic effects of an anti-Nogo antibody treatment; 3) as a
key step for clinical translation and validation, we will select the most promising SV2A PET tracer for spinal cord
imaging using nonhuman primate as the animal model. Successful completion of this project will yield a sensitive,
reliable, and quantitative imaging method ready to be tested in SCI patients as a diagnosis and prognosis
modality, as well as a research tool to probe the neuroplasticity in SCI animal models and patients. It will also
allow for the objective and longitudinal tracking of SCI progression and recovery."

 Sequence-specific transcription factors are critical mediators of cellular adaptation in response to both
extracellular and intracellular cues. These rapidly changing transcriptional programs facilitate everything from
cell fate decisions to stress responses, and the disruption of transcription factor function and/or expression is
associated with disease states including developmental disorders, neurologic disorders, and cancer. While it is
clear that the appropriate regulation of gene expression is critical for normal cellular function, historically, our
ability to understand how sequence-specific transcription factors rapidly and specifically alter transcriptional
programs has been limited by a toolbox of very slow genetic and knockdown strategies that take days to weeks
before transcription factor activity can be assayed. Therefore, while direct transcriptional effects occur within
minutes to hours, these models take days to establish resulting in the detection of secondary and/or
compensatory transcriptional changes that often mask the direct/immediate effects of transcription factor
disruption. In order to overcome these technical limitations, we use CRISPR-mediated genome editing to
introduce degron tags into endogenous transcription factor loci. This chemical-genetic approach results in rapid
transcription factor degradation (minutes to hours) following PROTAC treatment, and effectively collapses the
timeframe for assaying transcriptional changes, chromatin states, and genome-wide transcription factor
occupancy from days to hours. We complement these studies with proteomics-based approaches to identify
associated complexes and cooperating transcription factors, and are beginning to incorporate single cell and
single molecule imaging approaches to interrogate heterogeneity within transcriptional responses. Combined,
these approaches are allowing us to address fundamental questions in the transcription field including how
transcription factors are influenced by and exert influence over the chromatin landscape, how multiple sequence-
specific transcription factors cooperate to regulate gene expression, and how enhancer activity influences
promoter activation."

HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) are associated with adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction and
systemic metabolic alterations, including intra-abdominal fat accumulation, fatty liver disease,
dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Treatment of these defects using conventional drugs and
lifestyle interventions has been minimally effective. Viral factors and ART contribute to the
complex pathophysiology of these disease states in persons living with HIV (PLWH). Still, the
mechanisms that link viral factors and ART to defective AT and hepatic metabolism remain
incompletely understood. We have demonstrated in mouse models that the HIV accessory
protein Vpr is sufficient to cause all the cardinal manifestations of HIV-associated metabolic
disease. The Vpr mice also have high levels of FGF21 and increased subcutaneous AT
thermogenesis. The current proposal aims to establish mechanistic connections between
increased FGF21 levels, white AT thermogenesis, and the observed metabolic abnormalities in
Vpr mice and PLWH. Our central hypothesis is that Vpr expression alters the metabolic effects
of FGF21, altering AT and hepatic function and inducing maladaptive browning of subcutaneous
white AT. We will test this hypothesis by achieving the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine
how Vpr exposure affects white AT thermogenesis in mice; 2) Demonstrate how FGF21 shapes
the metabolic abnormalities of Vpr mice; 3) Establish relationships between FGF21’s endocrine
actions and defects of lipid and glucose metabolism and subcutaneous white AT function in
PLWH on suppressive ART. Our research plan will provide detailed dissection of the
relationships between HIV-associated metabolic disease and FGF21 physiology, molecular
mechanisms of thermogenesis and AT physiology, and immunology. The project will reveal
mechanisms of unique metabolic defects in Vpr mouse models that recapitulate those in PLWH,
and elucidate how FGF21’s endocrine functions contribute to HIV-associated metabolic
abnormalities in PLWH on ART. Ultimately, this translational work will identify mechanisms of
HIV-specific metabolic alterations and may identify therapeutic targets that can be exploited to
minimize the long-term clinical burden of metabolic disease in PLWH."

Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light between the ages of 15-20 years is the most important etiological factor in skin
cancer, yet adolescents and young adults (AYAs) this age are more likely to engage in health-compromising
behaviors like indoor and outdoor tanning without skin protection. As an intervention modality, social media (SM)
represents an opportunity to reach AYAs, who are among the most active Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter
users. Recent research suggests SM may also be a rich hub for proliferation of skin cancer misinformation; yet
the characteristics and diffusion patterns of this misinformation and risk/prevention communication across
platforms are unknown. Characterizing the skin cancer communication landscape and creating effective
risk/prevention posts, with an “understanding of which messages will resonate with specific groups” (The
Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer), could enable targeted prevention methods for AYAs.
Our long-term goal is to reduce health-compromising behaviors (e.g., indoor tanning, sunscreen nonuse) among
at-risk AYAs, who are vulnerable to developing skin cancer. This proposal’s main objective is to: 1) characterize
the SM landscape regarding skin cancer-related posts; and 2) develop/test messages for skin cancer prevention
among AYAs that are clear, specific, consistent, and scientifically up to date. With a robust multidisciplinary team,
we will accomplish this objective via three specific aims—AIM 1: Characterize skin cancer-related communication
across three popular SM platforms. AIM 2: Build a predictive, explainable health communication model to
determine the diffusion potential of skin cancer-related messages. AIM 3: Develop/pilot test sun-protection and
indoor tanning-related messages for AYAs for future implementation and evaluation. In AIM 1 we will use content
analyses to assess the skin cancer communication/misinformation landscapes on Facebook, Instagram, and
Twitter, describing message features, source characteristics, posters/users, and social networks, and identifying
network characteristics and diffusion patterns of skin cancer misinformation (exploratory). In AIM 2 we will apply
machine learning methods to characterize message features; develop/evaluate a predictive model of a message
diffusion potential using large-scale training data; apply the model to predict a set of online diffusion metrics for
a given message; and assess its ability to reach skin cancer prevention-relevant populations. In AIM 3 we will
engage two stakeholder segments in iterative rounds of message development/testing: 1) cancer organization
staff (who post on their SM accounts); and 2) intended recipients of these messages: five sub-groups of AYAs
aged 15-20 years—White boys/men, White girls/women, and White, Black, and Hispanic gay and bisexual
boys/men. The research is innovative because of its focus on posts across three SM platforms and the Multilevel
Model of Meme Diffusion (M3D). This work will provide a strong basis for the future development of improved
and targeted prevention efforts via digital platforms frequently used and easily accessed by AYAs, effectively
supporting the NCI’s mission to “advance scientific knowledge and help all people live longer, healthier lives.”"
10882878,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms regulating platelet (Plt) production and function upon
aging. Plts play essential roles in hemostasis, the process of preventing bleeding. Aging is associated with a
dramatic increase in platelet-related disorders, including alterations in Plt numbers (thrombocytosis or
thrombocytopenia) and in Plt hyperreactivity. Plts have a very short half-life of only a few days and are therefore
continually produced by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs are long-lived and undergo a number of
molecular and functional changes with age; thus, we postulate that Plt aging is a consequence of properties
inherited by their long-lived HSC source. Excitingly, we have discovered that the differentiation pathways of Plt
production are different in young and old mice. We hypothesize that the aging-specific Plt pathway contributes
to the dramatically increased risk for Plt-related disorders in the elderly. Here, we propose to investigate the
molecular and cellular mechanisms driving the aging-specific differentiation path, and the consequences for Plt
function and aging physiology. Our discovery of a new, age-specific differentiation path from HSCs to Plts
provides a unique opportunity for novel discoveries towards mitigating Plt-related disorders, including thrombosis
and cardiovascular disease, in the elderly."
10885140,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Monoclonal Antibody and Reagent Core
This Program Project addresses the impact of antibodies cross-reactive to DNA and
the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), DNRAbs, on adult and fetal brain. The
premise of the program is that DNRAbs induce a chronic inflammatory state in the adult
brain and permanent cognitive impairment in offspring exposed to these antibodies in
vitro
Projects 1 and 3 both utilize a panel of monoclonal DNRAbs. These need to be
produced in large quantity. The Monoclonal Antibody and Reagent Core will produce
both human and murine antibodies and will test these for preservation of antigen
binding. The Core will produce antibody that is validated for binding to DNA, DWEYS
and the extracellular domains of GluN2A/B. The Core will generate GluN2A/B
extracellular domains for use in ELISAs to confirm antibody specificity. Projects 2 and
3 requires that serum be tested for DNRAb titer. The Core will provide quality control
for these assays also. Project 3 will need large amounts of decoy antigen of high purity
to be produced.
This facility will be cost-effective and will maintain quality control for all 3 projects in the
Program. This represents an efficient approach to the generation of reagents to be
used by multiple investigators and one that maximizes the production of high quality
reagents.
Antibodies represent a highly versatile tool in medical research. They are used in
diagnostics, in basic and clinical research and in developing new therapies. The
DNRAbs created in our laboratory are utilized in all of the above areas not only in our
studies but in many laboratories within the United States and abroad."

10886116,"Faculty from two institutions, Weill Cornell Medicine ((WCM), formerly, Weill Cornell Medical College
(WCMC)), and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), who share a single PhD program, are
requesting funds to support an innovative and collaborative training program in cancer pharmacology.
Our cancer pharmacology training grant/program (CPTG) includes an integrated set of training activities
for PhD students and postdoctoral fellows. The strength and research diversity of the 24 faculty research
advisors provide opportunities for research in a variety of areas, including the development of new cancer
therapeutic agents (e.g. organic synthesis, monoclonal antibody technology, differentiation therapy,
immunotherapies, & the screening of chemical libraries), the analysis of molecular mechanisms to identify
new drug targets, exploration of how drugs act on cancer cells, cancer prevention, and clinical trials.
This CPTG is unusual in that it features broad training ranging from molecular pharmacology to animal
models of cancer and human clinical trials. Many faculty on the CPTG are physician-scientists who treat
patients as well as perform research. The PhD program includes course work, three lab rotations, an
admission to candidacy exam, thesis research, and a robust mentoring program. A major PhD course,
Cancer Pharmacology (part of this program) represents a strong commitment of the 24 CPTG faculty to the
training of students and fellows. Students and fellows present their research at the annual two-day
Pharmacology Program retreat and at scientific meetings. Pre- and postdoctoral CPTG fellows attend
weekly journal clubs and take courses related to cancer pharmacology. We are continuing to expand the
successful Bench-to-Bedside, a course in drug development/entrepreneurship. Since the last competitive
renewal, we established From Molecule to Prescription, a course taught by pharmacologists working in drug
companies. We also started a course on biostatistics, bioinformatics, and quantitative biology. We actively
use External and Internal Advisory Committees, plus a CARR (Committee for Admissions, Recruitment,
& Retention). This CPTG has a number of strengths, most notably extremely large pools of well-qualified
training grant-eligible applicants for both the predoctoral and postdoctoral positions; an expanding group
of highly collaborative and talented CPTG faculty research advisors; a high productivity in terms of
publications by trainees; and the tremendously vibrant and collaborative intellectual atmosphere in the
tri-institutional research area. Thus, this CPTG will continue to provide PhD students and postdoctoral
fellows with an in depth understanding of the interrelationships among research on the basic mechanisms
of drug action, drug development, and clinical issues, producing the next generation of clinicians,
clinician-scientists, and pharmacologists in basic research who will be well prepared to carry out
independent research and work at the scientific frontier to understand, prevent, and treat cancer."

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated nephropathy (COVAN) is a severe form of kidney disease
resulting from collapse of the glomerular tuft and manifesting clinically with proteinuria and high rates of kidney
failure. More than 90% of COVAN cases are associated with two coding variants in the apolipoprotein L1
(APOL1) gene. These variants are mainly found in persons with Black, African American, or Hispanic ancestry.
The objective of this proposal is to identify patient-specific determinants of APOL1-mediated COVAN
penetrance. Our published and preliminary data suggest that: 1. APOL1 is robustly expressed in the glomeruli
of patients with COVAN but not in healthy controls. 2. COVID-19-induced cytokines upregulate pathogenic
APOL1 variants via JAK-STAT signaling in human kidney organoids and, in turn, cause podocyte injury. 3.
Cytokine-induced podocyte injury is blocked by inhibition of JAK/STAT/APOL1 axis. 4. Expression of variant
APOL1 protein is sufficient to cause dose-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro. Consistent with these discoveries,
others found that expression of APOL1 variants caused glomerulosclerosis in transgenic mice. Based on these
published and preliminary data, we hypothesize that maladaptive crosstalk between glomerular cells and
immune cells drive increased expression of APOL1 and the pathogenesis of COVAN. Moreover, that patients
who develop COVAN either express higher levels of pathogenic cytokines (those cytokines known to induce
APOL1 expression), or the glomerular cells of these individuals have an enhanced and maladaptive response
to the same level of cytokine. To test this hypothesis, we will leverage unique patient-derived kidney organoids
and immune cells of persons with biopsy-proven COVAN (collected after patients have recovered from
infection). We propose two aims: 1.) Delineate the divergent biological responses of kidney organoids derived
from COVAN patients versus controls after (i) infection with SARS-CoV-2 or (ii) treatment with COVID-19
induced cytokines. 2.) Identify differences in cellular response of immune cells of COVAN patients versus
controls after (i) infection with SARS-CoV2 or (ii) treatment with COVID-19 induced cytokines. Identifying host-
factors that regulate APOL1 and immune-glomerular interactions in COVAN will provide novel biomarkers and
therapeutic targets for modulating APOL1 expression to treat COVAN and other forms of APOL1 nephropathy,
helping to mitigate disparities in kidney disease. Execution of these scientific aims and completion of the career
development activities of this proposal, along with the experienced mentorship and strong institutional support,
will prepare me for a career as an independent physician scientist equipped for research into APOL1-
mediated, inflammatory-mediated, and viral-mediated nephropathies."

In the U.S., incidence rates of HIV and bacterial sexually transmitted infections (BSTIs) are disproportionately
high among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men—referred to herein as sexual minority men
(SMM)—compared to men who have sex with women only. Roughly 10% of HIV incidence is attributable to
increased transmission due to untreated active chlamydia and gonorrhea infections among SMM, and 64% of
syphilis cases occur among SMM. Oklahoma is an Ending the HIV Epidemic priority rural state with above
average yearly cases of chlamydia and ranks in the top 10 for gonorrhea and syphilis infections nationwide.
Moreover, there has been an overall upward trend in HIV incidence among SMM in Oklahoma over the past
five years. An estimated 17.1% of HIV incidence among SMM is likely to be averted with doubling of HIV pre-
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) coverage, and the expansion of HIV and syphilis testing can aid in treatment as
prevention. Additionally, patient-delivered partner therapy (PDPT) is a method of BSTI prevention where
patients diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea are provided medication to give directly to their partners.
Concerns about PDPT have centered around missed opportunities for HIV and syphilis testing, which could be
alleviated by including HIV and syphilis self-testing kits with PDPT. Additional synergy is to pair PrEP with BSTI
diagnoses and PDPT since SMM diagnosed with BSTIs are priority candidates for PrEP. During Aim 1, we will
form a Community Advisory Board comprised of SMM (including racial/ethnic minorities and rural SMM),
healthcare providers, community advocates, and other stakeholders in Oklahoma. Working in collaboration
with this group, we will develop an intervention called 3T-Prevent with iterative refinement based on community
feedback from SMM (n = 20) and key informants (n = 20; clinicians, nurses, clinic managers, and other
stakeholders). Preliminary intervention activities include detailing clinics and providers to support distribution of
HIV and syphilis self-testing kits with PDPT to SMM for investigational purposes only; training and
telementoring providers to deliver theoretically guided counseling sessions to support self-testing, PDPT, and
PrEP use among patients and partners; and optimizing PrEP prescribing/referrals and linkage to HIV care. We
will pilot and evaluate the finalized intervention in three clinics in varied settings of Oklahoma that offer
HIV/BSTI testing services using a hybrid type-1 effectiveness-implementation design via a stepped-wedge
randomized controlled trial to mimic a future statewide implementation strategy. We will concurrently recruit
clinic directors (n = 3) and providers (n = 9) and 108 SMM within the three clinics. RE-AIM (Reach,
Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) evaluation will be assessed using convergent
mixed-method analysis of surveys (clinic directors, providers, and SMM patients), electronic medical records,
and exit interviews to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact."
10886075,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
CD8+ T cells are cytotoxic T lymphocytes that directly kill tumor and virally-infected cells. T cell exhaustion, in
which CD8+ T cells have impaired cell-killing capacity, occurs with prolonged exposure to viral and cancer
antigens and prevents optimal disease control. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting CTLA-4 or the
PD-1 pathway reinvigorates exhausted CD8+ T cells to promote tumor cell killing. Multiple trials have
demonstrated the efficacy of ICB in shrinking or eliminating tumors and prolonging survival; however,
intracranial tumors are more refractory to ICB therapy than extracranial tumors. Brain metastases affect a
significant number of cancer patients and are associated with poor overall survival. Therefore, novel strategies
are urgently needed to improve the treatment of tumors that have metastasized to the brain.
Development of novel immunotherapeutic agents relies on a detailed characterization of CD8+ T cell
heterogeneity in brain metastases. My preliminary data show that there are three distinct populations of CD8+
T cells in human brain metastases, one of which is defined by a terminally differentiated transcriptional
phenotype. Using a murine chronic infection model, I have also demonstrated that brain-infiltrating antigen-
specific CD8+ T cells have a unique, tissue-specific transcriptional phenotype, which is conserved in a subset
of the CD8+ T cells infiltrating human brain metastases. Because of this differential gene expression pattern, I
hypothesize that there may be novel co-inhibitory molecules expressed by brain-infiltrating antigen-specific
CD8+ T cells. Blocking these molecules may improve therapeutic efficacy of PD-1 pathway blockade and
enhance the effector function of exhausted CD8+ T cells in the brain.
This project has three goals. First, I will comprehensively characterize the phenotype of CD8+ T cells
infiltrating human brain metastases and determine how clonotypes that are shared with circulating CD8+ T
cells respond to treatment with immunotherapies. Second, I will identify genes that are differentially expressed
by brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells after ICB and test the function of these genes using the murine LCMV model
of CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Finally this grant will support my transition to independence from a trainee in Dr.
Rafi Ahmed’s lab, to leading an independent research group."
10887525,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Skull defects occur secondary to trauma, stroke, cancer, and congenital anomalies resulting in significant
neurological, psychological, social, and vocational burdens. Current clinical options for cranioplasty, or calvarial
reconstruction, are limited by availability and morbidity in autologous bone grafts and complications and cost in
alloplastic materials. Such drawbacks provide an opportunity to develop methods that specifically target
calvarial bone regeneration. Despite decades of research, contemporary regenerative strategies consisting of
expanded stem cells and growth factor cocktails delivered by scaffolding materials have not attained clinical
translation due to surgical impracticality, cost, time consumption, and safety concerns. The increasing
knowledge of instructive capabilities of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in cell fate determination has provided an
alternative paradigm for regeneration. We demonstrated that an ECM-inspired material composed of
nanoparticulate mineralized collagen glycosaminoglycan (MC-GAG) regenerates up to 60% the mineralization
and biomechanical properties of native calvarium without ex vivo progenitor cell loading or exogenous growth
factor supplementation. Simultaneously, MC-GAG inhibits osteoclast activation and resorption without affecting
the paracrine osteoinductive properties offered by osteoclasts via direct material to cell interactions as well as
indirectly by inducing osteoprogenitors to secrete osteoprotegerin (OPG), an endogenous inhibitor for
osteoclast activation. With the addition of exogenous OPG, this uncoupling of osteogenesis from
osteoclastogenesis is augmented. In combination, these data provided a proof of principle that a composite
material of MC-GAG and OPG (MCGO) delivered in a temporospatially-limited manner may be a potential
material for calvarial regeneration. In order to develop the MCGO material for clinical translation, three
questions must be answered: 1. What are the mechanisms activated in osteoclasts by direct interactions with
MC-GAG? 2. As the resorptive abilities of osteoclasts are necessary for remodeling and maturation of bone,
how long should OPG exist in the system? 3. Should OPG be eluted or anchored to the material? To answer
these questions, we have developed two MCGO materials via non-covalent and covalent incorporation of OPG
resulting in a high concentration, fast release and a low concentration, extended release MCGO material,
respectively. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the anti-osteoclastogenic mechanisms induced by MC-GAG and
MCGO materials. We hypothesize that MC-GAG and the two MCGO materials will differentially affect hOC
activation and resorption. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the two MCGO materials compared to MC-GAG in rabbit
calvarial regeneration to generate preclinical efficacy, safety, and performance data for MCGO materials
compared to MC-GAG. Our proposed studies are unified in the goal of calvarial regenerative technology
development. At the conclusion of the proposed studies, we expect to have amassed significant preclinical
data to support an IDE application for MCGO materials to the FDA."

Under a multi-PI leadership with an established track record of scientific and mentorship collaboration, we 
propose a comprehensive Los Angeles metropolitan area-based interdisciplinary graduate and postgraduate 
training program (KUH-Advanced Research Training or KUH-ART). The overarching objective of this program 
is to prepare trainees for long-term productive careers in high-impact research in benign nephrology, urology 
and hematology. To achieve this goal, we will: 
1) Recruit outstanding and diverse pre- and postdoctoral students. We will reach out through multiple 
media and programs to students and trainees at all levels, nationwide, and through fellowship matching 
programs in the KUH area, highlighting the attractive opportunities in the KUH-ART research space 
2) Develop and support a personalized guidance program, matching interested trainees with research 
mentors and labs. We will provide (a) easy-to-access general mentoring support and trainee advocacy, (b) 
career guidance and general research career skills (manuscript and grant preparation, collaboration, scientific 
communication, and networking) through partnerships with existing programs under UCLA-CTSI, and (c) 
trainee exposure to the array of available research careers from academia to biotechnology and pharma. 
3) Incentivize the development and support of specific educational research-oriented KUH content for 
KUH trainees at all levels, leveraging existing seminar series, courses and conferences. We will 
construct and evolve a virtual learning environment (VLE) that facilitates formal and informal interactions 
among our trainees, with mentors, and with trainees at other similar programs. We will develop new 
instructional content specific to the needs of our trainees. We will facilitate the participation of KUH trainees 
in broader scholarly communities according to their level of training (MSTP, graduate student lecture series 
and seminars, CTSI KL2 courses), and introduce KUH content into these activities. 
4) Measure and evaluate quality and outcomes to assess program effectiveness. Guided by our external 
and internal advisory boards, we will use the evaluation process for continuous quality improvement in 
curricular offerings, the learning environment, and trainee outcomes. 
KUH-ART will benefit from strong institutional support that will allow us to integrate existing resources and 
consolidate productive interinstitutional relationships. The geographic footprint and infrastructure of KUH-ART 
will build on the highly successful UCLA Clinical and Translational Science Institute, a research partnership of 
leading local institutions: UCLA, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and 
Science and Harbor-UCLA Medical Center/Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation. Successful 
implementation of KUH-ART will assure that diverse and talented biomedical trainees in the Los Angeles 
metropolitan area are recruited and optimally trained to contribute to solving important problems in the KUH area."
10887528,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The current paradigm of allergic inflammation asserts that allergen crosslinking of FcεR1-bound to allergen-
specific IgE leads to mast cell and basophil degranulation and release of effector molecules like histamine and
leukotrienes. AD is a classic allergic disorder like asthma and food allergy and the most common chronic illness
of childhood and is often a lifelong disease1. However, the specific role of IgE in AD pathogenesis is not well
characterized and controversial2,3. In 2021, the Kim lab showed that IgE-mediated mast cell stimulation triggers
histamine-induced itch in the steady state. Intriguingly, under AD-like conditions, IgE triggers basophils to elicit
non-histaminergic itch through the mediator leukotriene C4 (LTC4). Patients with AD demonstrated increased
IgE reactivity and basophil activation in association with acute itch flares4. In parallel, our studies demonstrated
for the first time that IgE glycosylation, and specifically sialic acid, is a determinant of IgE pathogenicity.
Increased sialic acid content of IgE resulted in more significantly mast cell degranulation in both murine and
human models5. Our studies raised the possibility that pathogenicity of IgE can be variably regulated to control
cellular responses through alterations in glycosylation. Taken together with the variations in IgE cellular
interactions in steady state and AD-associated itch demonstrated by Dr. Kim's group, our central hypothesis is
that unique IgE glycosylation patterns result in enhanced mast cell-mediated itch in the steady state, while also
promoting basophil-mediated acute itch flares in AD. We will test our central hypothesis and attain the objective
of the application by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) Do different glycoforms of IgE mediate itch in
the steady state?; 2) Does AD-associated inflammation result in the production of different glycoforms of IgE?;
3) Identify itch-specfic IgE glycosylation patterns in human AD. The role of specific IgE glycosylation in
contributing to itch in AD is unknown and regulation of these processes is poorly defined. The work from this
proposal will allow us to pursue our long-term goal of establishing how IgE glycosylation and basophils can be
targeted to yield innovative treatments for itch and AD. The overall objective of our proposal is to test the
mechanisms by which IgE glycosylation affects mast cell and basophil activation, respectively, contributing to
the development of different forms of itch. There is an urgent need to decrypt the role of IgE glycosylation in AD
in an effort to yield more effective therapies for AD-associated itch. These studies will have impact beyond AD
to diseases in which IgE and itch are implicated including allergic contact dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, and

Aging is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid and prion-like proteins. However, the molecular
mechanisms by which these proteins arise remain unclear. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that
the amyloid and prion-like proteins that accumulate in aging cells are generated by mistakes that occur during
transcription. To test this hypothesis, we will screen a database of 260,000 transcription errors identified in
human stem cells, brain organoids and fully differentiated neurons for candidates that are likely to create amyloid
peptides. We will then use a variety of cellular, biochemical and biophysical tools, including cryo-EM, TEM and
fluorescent imaging to test the amyloid behavior of these proteins. Our preliminary data indicates that these
experiments will create a powerful proof of principle of our hypothesis. Next, we will test how these transcription
errors are generated. Several studies suggest that DNA damage plays an important role in this process,
indicating that age-related DNA damage could drive the accumulation of amyloid and prion-like proteins. To test
this hypothesis, we will use single-cell-sequencing coupled to a new, custom-made bio-informatic pipeline to
determine if human neurons exposed to DNA damage display error prone transcription, and if so, how many
mutant proteins are generated as a result. Our preliminary data indicates that O6-methyl guanine lesions, a
common form of DNA damage in the brain, creates vast amounts of mutant proteins in single cells, strongly
supporting our hypothesis. Next, we will determine whether these errors are sufficient to induce protein
aggregation in human neurons using a plasmid-based system that contains a carefully placed O6-methyl guanine
lesion. Finally, we will test if O6-methyl guanine -induced errors can affect the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease
by removing the DNA repair gene MGMT in the neurons of a mouse model that carries a humanized version of
the APP protein. MGMT repairs O6-methyl guanine lesions, which will allow these lesions to accumulate over
time, increasing transcriptional mutagenesis. Moreover, it was recently found that MGMT is down-regulated in
female patients with non-familial cases of AD, so that this experiment closely mimics the conditions of human
patients. Accordingly, we think that in addition to testing our hypothesis, these experiments could also lead to
the first mouse model that fully mimics late onset, non-familial cases of AD. The most exciting aspect of our work
though, is the challenge we pose to the DNA-centric way of thinking in modern medicine. Our work shows that
in some cases, the mutations that give rise to disease do not have to occur in the genome, they can also occur
in the transcriptome. In doing so, our research could establish a new paradigm in modern medicine and open up
a new field of aging research to widespread experimentation."

In the retina, various neuronal types are confined to three somatic layers and connected in two plexiform layers.
Defects in neuronal positioning or connections result in vision impairment or blindness. While migration of
neurons to their destined layers is well studied, the influence of segregated nuclear layers on the formation of
neuronal connections remains unclear. This project aims to delineate the transcriptional control of neuronal
position and connection. We use starburst amacrine cells (SACs)—the cholinergic interneurons in the retina—
as a model to address this question. SACs are crucial components of the direction-selective (DS) circuit and
consist of two closely related subtypes. OFF SACs in the inner nuclear layer (INL) establish dendritic
stratifications and connections in the OFF layer (S2) of the inner plexiform layer (IPL), whereas ON SACs in the
ganglion cell layer (GCL) ramify their dendrites in the ON layer (S4) of the IPL. My previous research identified
the transcription factor Fezf1 that is specifically expressed by ON SACs and determines their somatic positions
in the GCL. In the Fezf1 constitutive knockout (Fezf1-/-), ON SACs are mislocalized to the INL alongside OFF
SACs. To overcome the neonatal lethality associated with Fezf1-/-, we generated a new Fezf1 conditional allele
to facilitate the study of postnatal development of SACs. We made three observations: (1) Similar to Fezf1-/-,
early embryonic deletion of Fezf1 results in mislocalization of ON SACs to the GCL, but late deletion allows them
to remain in the GCL (2) In both early and late Fezf1 deletions, SAC dendrites no longer separate into two distinct
layers but remain intermingled. (3) Following altered SAC dendritic stratification, ON and OFF direction-selective
ganglion cells (ooDSGCs) and ON DSGCs redirect their dendritic arbors from making contacts with SACs in S2
and S4 (ooDSGCs) or S4 (ON DSGCs) to contacting S2 alone. These findings collectively support the central
hypothesis that Fezf1 sequentially controls the somatic position, dendritic stratification, and synaptic connections
of SACs. We therefore propose two specific aims. Aim 1 aims to determine how Fezf1 mediates dendritic
stratification of SACs. We will elucidate the morphological changes of developing SACs via image-tracing and
assess the sufficiency of Fezf1 in rescuing the dendritic defects via in utero electroporation. We will determine
the regulatory network of Fezf1 using combined ATAC-seq and RNA-seq assays. Lastly, we will test the role of
repulsive molecules Slit2/Nell2/Robo2 in separating the dendritic arbors between ON and OFF SACs. Aim 2
aims to determine how the altered dendritic stratification of SACs redirects dendritic innervation of ooDSGCs
and ON DSGCs. We will use genetic labeling and image-tracing to determine the specificity of targeting defects
to DSGC types but not other RGC types. We will then use RNA-seq and AAV-mediated genetic manipulation to
determine the molecular mechanism that mediates the dendritic mistargeting of DSGCs. This project will
comprehensively dissect the transcriptional control of neuronal positioning and connection formation of SACs
and generate a new molecular basis for the assembly of the direction-selective circuit."

Women with severe aortic stenosis (AS), a condition characterized by the narrowing of the aortic valve opening,
often experience delayed diagnosis, undertreatment, and higher mortality rates compared to men, indicating
both delayed care-seeking and a lack of appropriate diagnostics and monitoring for female patients. Yet, the
influence of anatomical and functional differences in the female population on AS presentation, management,
and outcomes remains poorly understood. Furthermore, despite the prevalence of symptoms, women with
severe AS receive less aortic valve replacement (AVR) treatment and have higher excess mortality rates over a
five-year period compared to men.
Our proposed project integrates innovative medical image processing and computational modeling
methods, such as statistical shape analysis (SSA), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and inverse finite
element analysis (FEA), to gain sex-specific insights into cardiac remodeling and dysfunction, with a
specific focus on severe AS in women. By focusing on cardiac remodeling, a consequence of prolonged aortic
valve disease, our goal is to enhance AS treatment for women by considering sex-specific differences in
ventricular responses to AVR-induced afterload. To achieve this, we will develop a personalized, mathematical
approach that leverages sex-differentiating anatomical and functional characteristics of the left ventricle (LV),
ultimately aiming to improve survival outcomes. Additionally, we will compare the predictive value of these sex-
differentiating measures to traditional indices, enhancing our understanding of their effectiveness in guiding
clinical management. We hypothesize that advanced anatomical metrics (e.g., shape scores) and material
characteristics (e.g., cardiac stiffness) are superior predictors of post-intervention cardiac events and dysfunction
compared to traditionally collected clinical measures. Our research consists of two main aims. Aim 1 involves
developing a fully automated, neural network pipeline to segment clinical images, creating an advanced SSA
model to extract hidden geometrical features, and establishing a correlation between shape scores and post-
intervention clinical events. This analysis will assess the predictive power of sex-specific measures compared to
the male population, cases where sex is not considered in the model training, and universal clinical indices. Aim
2 focuses on developing a computational tool to estimate patient-specific stiffness of the inhomogeneous LV
tissue, with an examination of its potential value in predicting diastolic dysfunction and AVR outcomes.
Our research serves as a steppingstone to guide clinicians in preprocedural patient selection, optimize surgical
timing, and improve survival outcomes. By developing a sex-specific risk stratification tool and a mechanistic
framework for effective prognosis, we aim to provide valuable means to enhance treatment and mitigate
devastating events associated with severe AS, particularly for female patients."

The emerging field of allosteric inhibition of protein kinases has the potential to provide highly
targeted therapeutics for diverse diseases without undesirable side effects. Our long-term goal is
the discovery and development of highly selective allosteric inhibitors for side effect-free cancer
chemotherapy and for reversible non-hormonal contraception. The overall objective of this
application is to identify novel allosteric inhibitors for four kinases: WEE1-like protein kinase 2
(WEE2), testis-specific serine/threonine kinase 1 (TSSK1), cyclin-depended kinase 11 (CDK11),
and cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) by screening DNA encoded libraries (DEL) consisting of
2B compounds. The four kinases are validated drug targets: WEE2 for female non-hormonal
contraception, TSSK1 for male non-hormonal contraception, CDK11 for cancer chemotherapy
and CDK2 for cancer and male and female non-hormonal contraception. WEE2, TSSK1 and
CDK11 are on the NIH list of underexplored targets. CDK2 inhibitors have been studied for cancer
application but limited studies have been carried out for male contraception and none for female
contraception. Hit compounds from the DEL screen will be resynthesized by conventional
synthesis and then confirmed by using functional biochemical assays, orthogonal confirmatory
assays, and biochemical and biophysical assays to determine allosteric binding. Validated
compounds will be tested in a 24 kinome screen for kinase selectivity and in a limited set of in
vitro ADMET assays to assess their drug-like properties. CDK11 and CDK2 inhibitors will be
tested in cancer cell lines that express their respective targets. TSSK1 inhibitors will be tested
using a computer-assisted sperm analyzer (CASA) for sperm motility measurements. Selective
allosteric inhibitors identified in this project are expected to be useful probes to investigate the
biology of the four kinases and to serve as early leads for drug discovery."
10873145,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is responsible for a major fraction of severe acute respiratory tract infections, including pediatric, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals, and thus has a global impact on human health. Despite this, there are limited prophylactic and specific treatment options available for RSV infections. RSV nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2, which are unique to RSV among the pneumoviruses, play multiple major roles that are thought to enhance viral infection and to prevent protection from subsequent RSV reinfection. However, many questions remain that are related to how RSV virally encoded proteins shape the host response. Our unpublished preliminary studies show that NS1 partitions to the nucleus in physiologically relevant cell culture models, binds chromatin at promoters and enhancers of immune response genes, and impacts host gene transcription. In addition, we observe that nuclear NS1 interacts with viral proteins NS2 and matrix (M), an indication of further modulation of host factors in the nucleus by RSV viral proteins. Functional correlates of these observations are poorly understood. Based on these novel findings and to fill this knowledge gap, we propose to determine the molecular mechanisms of NS1 as a major modulator of the epigenome and host responses during RSV infection. Nuclear NS1 may also skew antiviral responses while enhancing immune evasion, thereby promoting viral pathogenesis. Our team, with complementary expertise in biochemistry/structural biology, epigenetics, transcriptional regulation, and pulmonology will define the impact of RSV NS1 on host epigenetic transcriptional control, define and characterize the molecular interactions that contribute to nucleocytoplasmic transport of NS1, and determine the impact of RSV NS2 and M protein interactions on NS1 nuclear functions. To obtain mechanistic insights and to assess the impact of these observations during viral infections, we will use an approach that integrates biochemical, structural, genetic, cellular, and virological studies in relevant cell culture models, including primary human lung derived cells. By completing these synergistic Aims, we expect to provide insights into key contributors to disease and define novel targets for antiviral and vaccine development."

HIV-infected Immune non-responders (INR) persons are at greater risk of comorbidity and mortality than are
immune responders (IR) who restore their CD4 T cells count (IR) after anti- retroviral therapy (ART). INR
have low CD4 T cell counts (<350 c/ul), heightened systemic inflammation, and increased CD4 T cell cycling
(KI67+). We previously reported dysfunctional mitochondria in INR CD4 T cells by transcriptomic and flow
cytometric assays. In here we report the metabolic profiles of sorted memory CD3+CD4+CD45RO+T cells
from healthy controls (HC), IR, and INR and found dysregulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)
intermediates suggestive of mitochondrial dysfunction confirmed by Electron Microscopy Imaging (EMI).
Disrupted Golgi structure, reduced mitochondrial numbers, inactive mitochondrial cristae, and evidence of
mitophagy were detected in INR EMI sections. We report the novel observation that memory CD4 T cells and
plasma samples of INR from several cohorts are enriched for levels of the gut-derived bacterial toxins p-
cresol-sulfate (PCS) and indoxyl sulfate (IS) that both negatively correlate with CD4 T cell counts. Incubation of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HC with PCS or IS blocks CD4 T cell proliferation in vitro,
induces apoptosis, and diminishes the expression of the mitochondrial proteins (COX-IV and mTFA). EMI
reveals perturbations of mitochondria network similar to those found in INR following incubation of sorted
memory CD4 T cells from HC with PCS or IS suggesting that PCS and IS may contribute to the diminished
mitochondrial fitness of INR CD4 T cells. Using bacterial 16S rDNA assay INR stool were found enriched
with proteolytic bacterial genera (Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, Lactobacillus) that metabolize tyrosine
and phenylalanine amino acids to produce PCS. We propose that gut bacterial flora toxins may impair CD4
T cell recovery during ART and may contribute to CD4 T cell lymphopenia characteristic of INR. We
propose, mechanistically, that PCS/IS induce toxicity to the mitochondrial network, mitochondrial DNA is then
released in the cytosol and activates STING that triggers caspases of the mitochondrial death pathway, IRF3,
and Interferon-Sensitive- Response Element (ISRE) genes implicated in apoptosis and pyroptosis induction
(AIM1). We will address whether enrichment of plasma PCS/IS in a large cohort of INR is correlated to low
CD4 T cell count, apoptosis/STING levels, and mitochondrial dysfunction in a set of ex-vivo experiments
(AIM2). We will then explore, by performing metagenomics, metaproteomics, and metabolic analyses,
whether commensal bacteria in the gut of INR subjects are in dysbiosis and enriched in bacterial strains
overproducing PCS and IS (AIM3)."

numerical optimization approach to correcting for self-absorption of x-ray fluorescence in thicker specimens, so
that one can obtain quantitative information even from thicker specimens in 3D. All of these developments will
take place in the context of our Driving Biomedical Projects, with large-area cryo SXFM being of particular

The Administrative and Research Support Core (ARC) is responsible for initiating and coordinating all activities
undertaken by the USC/UCLA Center on Biodemography and Population Health (CBPH). The overarching aim
of the Center is to promote scientifically important research and to develop infrastructure and resources
designed to foster and support innovation and progress in methodological and substantive issues that will most
effectively promote significant scientific advancement in the area of Biodemography. To accomplish our goal,
we leverage the unique and complementary expertise of the CBPH co-directors and their respective
institutions, combining expertise and experience in classic demographic analysis and methods, genetics and
genomic theory and methods, and clinic- and community-based, epidemiological/biological research methods.
The aims of the ARC are to (1) provide national and international leadership in the field of Biodemography by
arranging seminars and meetings that provide discussion of theory, methods, and analytic approaches for
using biological data from large populations; (2) develop networks of appropriate experts from around the world
who can provide information on theory, methods, and data relevant to novel biomarkers in populations; (3)
encourage the hiring and development of faculty affiliates at USC and UCLA who can further the research aims
of the CBPH; (4) perform the administrative and financial tasks required for the management and direction of
the CBPH; (5) provide oversight and support for activities of the Program Development Core [PDC] ; and (6)
provide oversight, support and scientific leadership for activities of the Research Development and Research
Resources and Dissemination Core [RRDC]. Our past efforts have generated methodological and substantive
knowledge of great value to population health researchers generally, and have promoted growth of the field of
biodemography by encouraging improvements in methods relating to collection and analysis of biological data
and substantive understanding of biological parameters. The effective administration of the CPBH has been
largely responsible for accomplishing Center aims. We propose to maintain these effective organizational
structures and functions of the ARC from the past period in order to continue to provide the biodemographic
infrastructure needed to support significant improved and expansion of scientific progress in addressing major
substantive questions in the field of biodemography."

The overarching aim of the Program Development Core (PDC) is to provide pilot funding to support the
development of innovative and ground-breaking research that will lead to a fuller understanding of the
processes affecting population health at older ages and how these processes are modified by biological,
social, behavioral, psychological, economic, environmental, and health care conditions. Prior pilot projects
have significantly increased our understanding of the roles of life circumstances, behaviors, stressors, and
DNA genetics in affecting biological outcomes, as well as downstream health outcomes. Projects have also
been extremely successful in providing a basis for subsequent funded research and significant publications. In
keeping with the overarching aim of the CBPH, we have devoted a subset of our pilot projects to the
development of innovations in biological and health measurement and data which provide increased resources
for the entire research community. Our proposed pilots for the first year reflect the current CBPH focus on
cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging. Pilot 1 addresses the RNA Transcriptomics and Life Course
topics; Pilot 2 addresses the Context, Cognition and Epigenetics/Inflammation topic; Pilot 3 addresses the Cell
Senesence, DNA Methylation & Life Course; Pilot 4 addresses the Cognition and Brain Aging topic. They all
propose the use of at least one type of newly developed data: RNA transcriptome profiling, DNA methylation,
flow cytometry, and MRI data. The PDC has also been an important mechanism for integrating and developing
biodemographic researchers including emerging scholars, new faculty, and faculty transitioning into
biodemography at both our Universities and in the wider field. Proposed pilots include researchers from two
other Universities and all include an emerging scholar. The PDC is strongly integrated with the activities of the
Administrative Research Core (ARC) and our Research Resource and Dissemination Core (RRDC). Most
pilots produce work integrated into our national meetings organized by the ARC and some pilots either begin or
transition to validation projects in the RRDC. Funding over the next cycle will further advance the field of
Biodemography by developing new investigators, recruiting into the field established senior investigators from
other fields, and broadening the range of biological parameters assessed in population health research, all with
the aim of understanding more clearly the biological pathways through which lived experience impacts

Abstract
The over-arching goal of the External Research Resources & Dissemination Core (RRDC) is to continue its
methodological innovation and broad service to the field of Biodemography by providing resources and
expertise needed to address critical barriers to improved biodemographic research – namely, the field’s on-
going need for comprehensive information on validated protocols for collection, processing and analysis of
biological specimens for use in large population survey studies. The USC/UCLA Center on Biodemography
and Population Health (CBPH)’s RRDC is uniquely well-positioned to support needed development of new
protocols and validation of new and existing protocols as a consequence of the clinical and laboratory
infrastructure and professional expertise we have in measurement and analysis of circulating biomarkers,
functional genomics/epigenetics and other indicators of health. The RRDC’s primary goals are to: (1) support
methodological/technical development and innovation along with validation work to extend the breadth of
biomarker and other relevant protocols for use in population-based surveys; (2) disseminate resulting
information on theoretical and practical aspects of biomarker measurement to the research community; and
(3) increase knowledge about functional genomics/epigenetics through workshops offered at strategic
professional meetings and training and technical support for functional genomics/epigenetic analysis. Through
these aims, the RRDC has made multiple, significant contributions to the field of biodemography as a whole.
For the next funding period, the RRDC will extend and expand its methodological and technical innovations
and its educational activities in response to the continuing need for well-validated protocols, strategic and
technical support for a growing array of biomarkers, and for dissemination of that information to the broader
population health research community. Building on our past success, the RRDC will pursue its aims through
two “sub-cores” – one focusing on functional genomics/epigenetics and the second on other biomarkers more
generally as well as two new proposed RRDC efforts: (i) providing cross-calibration specimens for use by
studies seeking to harmonize their biomarkers with other population health studies and (ii) developing and
disseminating new contextual data resources. The RRDC will also continue its various dissemination activities
in collaboration with other CBPH cores, including contributions to the CBPH website and participation in CBPH
presentations and meetings. Together, these sub-cores provide the unique expertise, equipment and methods
needed for work on functional genomics/epigenetics while also maintaining infrastructure to support
methodological and educational activities relating to a broader array of biomarkers. This dual focus allows the
RRDC to maximize our ability to achieve the overarching goal of developing enhanced research resources and
methods for research in biodemography and population health."
10874674,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is the 2nd most common type of leukemia diagnosed with a 5-year survival rate
of only 27%. Though dose-intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy induces clinical complete
remission in the majority of patients suitable for treatment, most relapse whereas others develop refractory
AML. Recently, the Bcl-2 inhibitor, venetoclax, demonstrated improved clinical outcomes when combined with
the conventional therapeutic, cytarabine (AraC), in relapsed and refractory AML. Based upon efficacy in
preclinical models, we hypothesize that liposomal delivery of the pro-apoptotic bioactive lipid C6-ceramide will
augment the efficacy of this low dose AraC/venetoclax standard-of-care regimen and have a meaningful
clinical impact in treating relapsed/refractory AML. This hypothesis will be examined in three Specific Aims. In
Specific Aim 1, a Phase 1b (dose escalation)/2a (dose-expansion) clinical trial for ceramide nanoLiposomes
(CNL) in relapsed/refractory AML patients treated in combination with low dose AraC and venetoclax (pre-IND
#142902, UVA Protocol Review Committee Approval #5414, CAV trial) will be conducted. The premise of this
trial is supported by the fact that CNL has already reached its putative MTD in an FDA (IND 109471,
NCT02834611) NCI-supported (U43 CA186118) Phase 1 trial for solid tumors, where CNL has been well-
tolerated with multiple patients exhibiting stable disease. In Specific Aim 2, we examine the underlying
cooperativity between CNL, AraC, and venetoclax in AML. We show that co-administration of CNL with AraC
and/or venetoclax exerts multiple synergistic mechanisms of efficacy. First, we demonstrate that this regimen
increases the ratio of pro-apoptotic C16- and C18-ceramides over less apoptotic C24 ceramides. Utilizing
molecular strategies in both in vitro and in vivo models, we will test the hypothesis that this is mediated by
ceramide synthases and determine how ceramide synthases regulate AML survival. Second, we show that
CNL reduces venetoclax-induced elevation of pro-survival proteins. We will test the hypothesis that this effect
is STAT3-dependent using molecular approaches in preclinical models. In Specific Aim 3, we show that the
ratio of C18 to C24 ceramides predicts progression-free survival in AML patients, which is the first application
of this ratio as a biomarker for cancer. We will extend and confirm sphingolipid metabolites or ratios as
biomarkers of AML biology and prognosis utilizing large, well-characterized AML samples as a validation
cohort. while also investigating clinical samples from Specific Aim 1 to assess biomarkers of CNL efficacy.
Published and unpublished observations demonstrate that high-expression of enzymes that decrease
ceramide levels (acid ceramidase, sphingosine kinase, glucosylceramide synthase) and reduce pro-apoptotic
ceramides (e.g. C16/C18) leads to lower survival in AML patients. Together, the proposed studies will test the
clinical application and unravel the mechanistic pathways of CNL cooperativity with AraC/venetoclax, while
ascertaining the prognostic impact of dysregulated sphingolipid metabolism in AML."
10874676,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults and is a growing public health
burden as the population ages. Dose-intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy dramatically reduces
tumor burden and induces clinical complete remission in the majority of younger individuals. However, AML
patients rarely achieve durable response and typically relapse with chemoresistant disease. Thus, improved
therapeutic approaches are imperative. AML is extremely heterogeneous in terms of clinical behavior as well as
molecular alterations. The field increasingly utilizes molecular profiling to provide prognostic predictors of
outcome and identify targets for selective inhibitors. The overarching hypothesis of this Program Project is that
sphingolipid metabolism is dysregulated in AML and represents a promising target for therapy. Acid ceramidase
(AC) is a central mediator in sphingolipid metabolism that controls the levels of the pro-apoptotic lipid ceramide
and pro-survival lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). AC expression and enzymatic activity are significantly
elevated in primary AML samples. The premise of the project is supported by our recent data demonstrating that
patients exhibiting high AC activity also showed reduced progression-free and overall survival. AC inhibitors and
gene knockdown exhibited therapeutic benefit in human AML cell lines, primary AML samples, and murine AML
models, thereby validating AC as a promising target in this disease. Two specific aims will be pursued to explore
the hypothesis that new AC inhibitors will exhibit increased potency in AML and that molecular alterations modify
the susceptibility to AC targeting agents. Specific Aim 1 will characterize the ability of new AC inhibitors to alter
sphingolipid metabolism and the mechanism whereby they induce killing in AML cell lines and patient samples.
Nano-encapsulation strategies will be optimized to enhance in vivo drug delivery of these compounds. The
efficacy of these inhibitors will then be tested in combination with C6-ceramide nanoliposomes (CNL), the Bcl-2
inhibitor venetoclax, and the AraC/venetoclax combinatorial regimen that is investigated across all Projects. We
demonstrate that AC inhibitors increase the efficacy of each of these agents. These approaches will be applied
to state-of-the-art human AML xenograft models to demonstrate preclinical efficacy and will be compared to
standard-of-care chemotherapy models. Specific Aim 2 will determine the relationship between AML molecular
subtypes, AC activity, and sensitivity to AC inhibitors. These studies will be completed across diverse AML cell
lines and primary patient samples and will include cooperative analysis together with the Systems Metabolomics
Core (Core C). Next, the link between AC and mutations (NPM1c, FLT3-ITD, DNMT3AR882H) that are frequently
detected in AML will be characterized. These studies will utilize genetically engineered cell lines and mouse
models, which also provide the opportunity to validate AC targeting in vivo in the context of defined molecular
drivers. The proposed studies will facilitate future clinical application of AC inhibitors in AML by identifying the
optimal therapeutic agent as well as susceptible patient populations."
10874677,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The sphingolipid (SL) ceramide is a potent tumor suppressor that contributes to the promotion of apoptosis and
autophagy. Management of these responses in cancer cells is dependent on the dynamic balance between
ceramide and its metabolites, some of which can promote cell survival. Maintaining elevated levels of intracellular
ceramide is important for supporting its unique anticancer properties. Thus, from a strategic point, controlling the
metabolism of ceramide offers new opportunities for regulating cancer growth. The goal of this work is to assess
innovative steps to develop ceramide into an effective anticancer agent to treat acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML), the most common type of leukemia in adults, and to evaluate the role of SLs in chemotherapy resistance.
There is a critical need to develop more effective therapies for AML, especially in relapse patients. Although
many hypotheses have been proposed to explain therapeutic relapse, none have led to a complete
understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AML resistance, and there have been few treatment advances
in 40 years. Our premise is that upregulated glycosylation of ceramide is the major metabolic avenue
contributing to ceramide neutralization in cancer cells, and it is also strongly associated with the multidrug-
resistant phenotype in cancer. This project will focus on targeting ceramide glycosylation to enhance and propel
ceramide-driven AML cell death. Two innovative strategies will be employed to increase intracellular ceramide
levels: 1) use of a nanoliposomal, cell-permeable ceramide analog, C6-ceramide (CNL, ceramide
nanoliposome), and 2) employment of ceramide “generators”, drugs such as 4-HPR (fenretinide) or PSC833
(valspodar), that increase intracellular levels of natural long-chain ceramides. These strategies will be evaluated
separately, in combination, and in the presence of agents that inhibit ceramide glycosylation. We hypothesize
that taking steps to pharmacologically increase and maintain intracellular ceramide levels will enhance the overall
anticancer impact of ceramide-centric therapy. Further, given new findings on chemotherapy selection pressure
in AML, we hypothesize that aberrant SL metabolism plays a key role in drug resistance and that targeting SL
metabolism will potentially circumvent drug resistance. The following three Specific Aims will be pursued to
achieve our goal of employing ceramide and SL therapy in AML.
 1. Determine the effects of chemotherapy selection pressure on SL metabolism and the drug resistant
 phenotype in AML.
 2. Determine the effects of inhibitors of ceramide glycosylation on cytotoxicity and mechanism of action of
 CNL and ceramide-generating drugs.
 3. Assess the anticancer activity of ceramide-centric therapeutics in AML preclinical models. We predict
 that using adjuvants to block ceramide glycosylation will enhance ceramide-centric (CNL + ceramide
 “generators”) therapy in AML."

 More than 1.7 million cases of Chlamydia trachomatis infections are reported to the
CDC each year, making it the most commonly reported infectious disease in the country.
C. trachomatis causes an intracellular infection, and we have discovered that this
bacterium causes two effects on an infected host cell that have not been previously
described: 1) loss of the primary cilium, which is a solitary surface projection on most
differentiated cells in the body; 2) re-entry of a quiescent host cell into the cell cycle.
These novel host-pathogen interactions may have been missed because the
conventional Chlamydia cell culture infection model uses cycling cells that lack primary
cilia. In Aim 1, we will determine if Chlamydia infection causes loss of the primary cilium
by inducing cilia disassembly through the AurA regulatory pathway of the host cell. In
Aim 2, we will investigate how Chlamydia causes cell cycle re-entry and will determine if
the infection involves and dysregulates known cellular regulators of cell cycle re-entry
and progression. In Aim 3, we will study if and how Chlamydia-induced primary cilia loss
and cell cycle re-entry promote the chlamydial infection. We will also investigate if these
two host-pathogen interaction are functionally linked or independent from each other.
Successful completion of these studies will define two novel host-pathogen interactions:
no microbe is known to cause primary cilia loss, and only viruses, but not bacteria, have
been shown to cause quiescent host cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Interventions to
prevent Chlamydia-induced primary cilia loss and cell cycle re-entry may lead to a novel
therapeutic strategy against Chlamydia infections."

alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent primary liver disease occurring during pregnancy.
Recent clinical and our preliminary studies have revealed that women with ICP and NAFLD have an increased
risk for developing pregnancy complications of preterm birth (PTB) and stillbirth. However, the etiological link
and underlying mechanisms remain to be determined. Currently there are limited intervention options to prevent
or reduce pregnancy complications of PTB and stillbirth for pregnant women with liver diseases. In our recent
and preliminary study with 36,755 pregnant women, we found that serum total bile acid (sTBA) levels directly
correlate with the pregnancy complications of PTB and stillbirth and both ICP and NAFLD patients had markedly
elevated sTBA levels. Bile acid cholic acid (CA) dose-dependently induced pregnancy complications of PTB and
stillbirth and restoring bile acid homeostasis markedly reduced PTB and dramatically improved newborn survival
rates. So, it was concluded that elevated bile acids are the etiological linker between liver diseases ICP and
NAFLD and pregnancy complications of PTB and stillbirth. The overall objective of this proposal is to
understand the mechanistic linkages among ICP, NAFLD, bile acids and pregnancy complications as well as the
underlying mechanisms. The central hypothesis, built on our extensive preliminary results, is that elevated bile
acids in pregnant women with liver disorders such as ICP and NAFLD induce pregnancy complications of PTB
and stillbirth through activating the Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) signaling pathway, and restoring
bile acid homeostasis by drugs will reduce or prevent bile acids-mediated pregnancy complications of PTB and
stillbirth. Three specific aims will be conducted. Specific Aim 1 is to investigate the roles of TGR5 signaling
pathway in the induction of pregnancy complications by elevated bile acids. Specific Aim 2 is to investigate
increased risk and underlying mechanisms for NAFLD subjects to develop ICP and its associated pregnancy
complications. Specific Aim 3 is to investigate the therapeutic potentials of four types of FDA-approved
drugs that modulate bile acid homeostasis on pregnancy complications. The experiments proposed are
built on our extensive, robust and novel preliminary findings, animal models established as well as our long-
standing experience in studying bile acid regulation and associated liver diseases. our team is thus uniquely
poised to investigate the underlying mechanisms and develop potential therapies for liver diseases-associated
and bile acids-induced pregnancy complications of PTB and stillbirth."
10872038,"Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a recurrent neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by wide fluctuations in mood, energy, and activity. Although the hallmark of BD is mania in BD-I (hypomania in BD-II), depressive episodes dominate the longitudinal course and account for a disproportionate degree of the morbidity and mortality. About 25% of patients with BD meet criteria for treatment-resistant bipolar depression (TRBD). Given the gravity of the illness and paucity of available therapies, there exists a large unmet need for more effective interventions. We propose an early feasibility study to advance the therapy and neurobehavioral monitoring of TRBD with deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) using a sensing capable device. We will leverage a smart phone-based software platform paired with the device's chronic sensing capability to record local field potentials (LFPs) time-locked with remote, high-density measures of natural behavior (e.g., from wearables). Our goal is to detect relevant behavioral states including both depression and mania and transitions between these states, including high risk mixed features. Real-time, remote detection of affective states via both behavioral and neural data monitoring will enable new interventional strategies to shift behavior away from pathological behavioral states towards healthier ones, contributing to the long-term stability of patients with BD. Aim 1: Efficacy and safety of VC/VS DBS for TRBD will be examined in a 9-month open-label early feasibility study of 10 subjects with BD-I, followed by a 3-month stabilization period, and then blinded discontinuation at month 12 to confirm active vs. sham response. Efficacy outcome will be based on rating scale measures of initial response at 9 months, absence of recurrence of depression during follow-up at 18 months, and management of emergent (hypo)mania. Aim 2: Mania/mixed feature detection. 2a. Given the risks of inducing mania or mixed states, a clinician-facing dashboard will be created and updated every 24 hours displaying raw data for: affect/mood, energy/activity, sleep, speech, and anxiety. Behavioral and physiological data will be derived from multimodal methods (e.g., computer vision, voice recordings, Apple watch, Oura Ring, etc.), in/outside the clinic, to objectively assess changes in key behavioral domains. 2b. Composite measures of mood and energy/activity will be developed using machine learning (and other methods) based upon data from the trial subjects. The clinician will be notified when a state change (e.g., emerging mania) is identified that warrants adjustment of stimulation. Aim 3: Identify neural markers to be used as classifiers for state changes from depression into either manic or mixed states. Development of neural classifiers for (hypo)mania builds upon research from an NIH funded study of VC/VS DBS in subjects with OCD. The outcome of this aim, coupled with aim 2, has implications for advancing DBS programming with the clinician-in-the-loop and possible future development of an adaptive DBS system in BD. Meeting all milestones could also inform studies of DBS in depression with respect to neurobehavioral feedback to drive DBS programming decisions."

This application aims to advance our understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD) by combining genetic
information and analyzing speech patterns of those with MDD to identify subtypes. MDD is the leading cause
of disability throughout the world, yet, relative to other common disorders, less is known about its origins.
There are less effective treatments and much less is spent on trying to understand how it arises and how to
cure it. Current treatments are relatively ineffective, with up 50% of patients refractory and many suffering
severe recurrence. Understanding the mechanisms underlying MDD has been recognized as a grand
challenge in global mental health. Thus, developing new treatments for MDD is a major priority for public health.
A major challenge for MDD research is the presence of heterogeneity. The existence of multiple subtypes of
MDD has been suspected for a long time, and likely confounds the ability to treat the disorder appropriately
with existing treatments, as well as making it hard to identify the causes of MDD as a prelude to developing
new treatments. However finding subtypes has been hard. Given that the way people talk can reflect
alterations in mood, we expect voice to be able to predict mood, and hence potentially be used as biomarker to
recognize heterogeneity. In preliminary data show that in combination with genetic data high-dimensional vocal
features extracted from recordings can be used to identify subtypes. Furthermore, the use of genetic data
allows us to impute voice features into large biobanks where no recordings exist, making it possible to explore
the relationship between vocal features and a rich array of clinically important indicators. We explore the power
of voice to make a diagnosis of MDD, to predict severity and other clinical features. Applying our approach to
will inform clinical management, improving diagnosis, refine treatment and aid the development of new
treatments"
10882952,"Excessive binge alcohol intake is a well-recognized risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common arrhythmia
with a high morbidity and mortality, yet current therapies have suboptimal effectiveness. [While aging is an
unavoidable AF risk factor, alcohol as a secondary stressor exacerbates AF risk in the aging population.] Clinical
data suggest that one-third of all new-onset AF cases are related to alcohol intoxication and alcohol abuse brings a
high AF risk even in people without co-existing cardiovascular diseases. It is a classic concept that enhanced
inflammation contributes to alcohol-caused organ damage, which could also lead to AF. However, the
ineffectiveness of the anti-inflammation therapies in AF patients has demonstrated the urgent need to understand
the detailed underlying mechanisms of inflammation-associated AF and explore novel anti-AF therapeutic
targets. The goal of this proposal is to fill this knowledge gap by establishing a previously unrecognized crosstalk
between the pro-inflammatory signaling pathways and the stress kinase JNK2 in AF pathogenesis. In human donor
atria, binge alcohol exposure increased pro-inflammatory TNFα and IL1β-NLRP3 signaling along with activated JNK2.
And TNFα or IL1β significantly enhanced diastolic SR Ca2+ leak and triggered activities (Ca2+ waves and delayed
after depolarizations), while either JNK2 or NLRP3 inhibition effectively alleviated those triggered activities,
suggesting a crosstalk between JNK2 and pro-inflammatory signaling. However, we found that only TNFα, but not
IL1β, activates cJNK2. Yet, TNFα is known to upregulate IL1β signaling, which could explain the involvement of
NLRP3 in TNFα-induced triggered activities. But why JNK2 is not influenced by IL1β yet is critically involved in
IL1β-NLRP3-mediated Ca2+ mishandling remains completely unknown. [This proposal is thus aimed to establish
a novel and potentially paradigm-shifting and translationally important link between the JNK2-NLRP3 nexus (as a
pathological nodal point; it has never been revealed before) and a complex web of co-existing pro-inflammatory
pathways in AF pathogenesis and most importantly, testing therapeutic potentials of targeting this pathological
nexus as a novel anti-AF approach.] Our multi-discipline team will use a unique diversified approach (molecular
biochemistry to single channel/myocytes/whole-heart electrophysiology in animal models/human donor hearts)
to systematically address two Specific Aims 1) Determine the underlying mechanisms of the JNK2-NLRP3
feedback loop in atrial Ca2+ mishandling; 2) Establish the functional contribution of JNK2 and/or pro-inflammatory
signaling pathways in binge alcohol-evoked arrhythmic activities and AF pathogenesis. The scientific premise of
this proposal is strong because it integrates important functional measurements and fundamental mechanistic studies
along with appropriate alternative approaches. [Cardiac specific interventions (in vivo atrial gene transfer & genetic
modification & target-specific pharmacological inhibition) that limit cJNK2 and/or NLRP3-inflammasome activity will
be used as proof-in-principal studies to prove the JNK2-NLRP3 feedback loop in AF pathogenesis and shed new
light on future development of anti-AF therapeutic strategies and new drug discovery.]"
10882530,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Each year millions of individuals suffer from heart ailments such as myocardial infarction (MI), myocarditis,
cardiomyopathies, etc. that lead to heart failure. Most heart failures are due to the loss of conductivity and
contractility secondary to fibrosis that develops as a common response to these cardiac conditions. Early
localization of myocardial fibrosis and its resolution is critical to address functional deficit in the failing heart
as some types of cardiac fibrosis can be reversed by timely treatment before changes become irreversible.
Current diagnostic methods to localize cardiac fibrosis are limited to either myocardial biopsy (invasive, risky,
and prone to sampling error) or contrast-magnetic resonance imaging (low sensitivity and only able to detect
fibrosis at an advanced and irreversible stage). The objective of this project is to investigate a novel radiotracer
18F-fluoroglucaric acid (18F-FGA) for early detection of cardiac fibrosis by positron emission tomography
(PET). PET is a superior imaging technology because of its high resolution, sensitivity, and lack of attenuation.
Using molecular techniques, our lab has recently reported that 18F-FGA interacts with an early fibrosis protein
called fibronectin. Earlier, we developed a novel rapid technique of synthesizing 18F-FGA from commercially
available 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), and we reported highly sensitive detection of myocardial
infraction and drug-induced cardiomyopathy in preclinical models. The overarching hypothesis of this
proposal is that the interaction of 18F-FGA with fibronectin and its distribution in myocardial injury can be
exploited to non-invasively detect onset and progress of cardiac fibrosis by PET imaging. We will 1) determine
the dynamics of interaction between 18F-FGA and fibronectin (Aim 1); 2) determine time-course of fibronectin
accrual in myocardial injury and correlate with 18F-FGA/PET findings (Aim 2), and; 3) assess toxicity and
internal dosimetry of 18F-FGA produced by a rapid kit-based method (Aim 3). We will investigate the
mechanism of 18F-FGA localization in myocardial injuries, namely MI, drug-induced cardiomyopathy, and
myocarditis, by the use of chemical biology approaches and preclinical models. We will also refine the method
of 18F-FGA production and quality control to create a kit-based method. We will use the refined kit to determine
radiation dosimetry and potential toxicities of FGA for IND-enabling data.
Successful implementation of this research will help in clinical translation of 18F-FGA for diagnosis and
monitoring of myocardial fibrosis as well as subtle forms of myocardial injury. It will provide cardiologists a
window of opportunity to implement treatment and life-style changes to prevent progression to heart failure if
cardiac fibrosis is detected early at a reversible stage. In addition, clinical translation of anti-fibrotic agents will
be immensely facilitated by the availability of a non-invasive, specific, and sensitive technique to locate and
monitor cardiac fibrosis."
10884331,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This NIH K08 proposal describes a five-year training and research plan for the candidate, a physician-scientist
with a long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator in the field of neonatal medicine. Toward this
end, the proposed research is directed at defining the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) – a
devastating inflammatory bowel disease of preterm infants that is characterized mainly by the excessive
activation of the Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) family of innate immune receptors. Inherent genetic susceptibility
and the intestinal microbiota environment are two factors strongly implicated in NEC pathogenesis. These
factors have primarily been evaluated in isolation from each other – an important limitation that does not
replicate the complex nature of NEC.
Recently, our laboratory generated novel transgenic mice that recapitulate a mutation discovered in infants
with NEC. This mutation is a stop mutation of Single-Immunoglobulin Interleukin-1 Related Receptor (SIGIRR),
a gene that normally functions to inhibit gut TLR signaling. The generated SIGIRR transgenic mice (SIGIRRTG)
exhibit a phenotype of increased gut TLR activity at baseline conditions. In this study, the candidate proposes
to use this novel mouse line as a genetic model of NEC to determine the interaction between genetics and the
gut microbiome as it relates to gut TLR activity. Aim #1 will determine the impact of SIGIRR mutation on gut
microbiota signatures. Aim #2 will determine whether increased intestinal TLR activity in SIGIRRTG mice is
driven by gut microbiota. Aim #3 will determine the effect of gut microbiome alteration in reversing genetic
predisposition of SIGIRRTG mice towards intestinal inflammation. Completion of these aims will provide novel
insights into how genes and the gut microbiome interact to influence TLR homeostasis in the developing gut.
New knowledge gained will represent a significant advancement in understanding the complex pathogenesis of
NEC that can be used to inform the development of personalized, microbiome-based therapies for NEC.
The candidate is firmly committed to a career in basic and translational NEC research and is strongly
supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his department at Children’s Mercy Kansas
City. He currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics with 75% protected time for
research, independent laboratory and office space, and start-up funding. The current proposal includes a
comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to advance the candidate’s skills and knowledge in TLR biology,
microbial pathogenesis, cell and molecular biology, microbiome sequencing, bioinformatics, and research
ethics. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience
necessary to develop an independent research program and obtain R01 funding."
10884332,"Gene regulation by RNA interference is usually attributed to microRNA, but RNAi has a more ancient
and fundamental role in heterochromatic silencing and genome stability. Heterochromatin comprises
condensed repetitive regions of eukaryotic chromosomes, and mediates transcriptional silencing,
chromosome segregation and genome integrity. We have found that heterochromatin is unexpectedly
transcribed, and that subsequent RNAi guides histone modification. In the fission yeast S. pombe, “co-
transcriptional” silencing occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle, followed by transcriptional silencing
thereafter. Release of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) during replication prevents DNA damage, but without
RNAi, replication forks stall and are repaired by homologous recombination (HR), causing genome
instability. We have found that RNAi regulates genome stability through R-loops, RNA-DNA hybrid
structures at transcription-replication collisions that promote HR.
Silencing depends on histone modification, but recent studies show this may be an oversimplification.
First, histone methylation recruits Heterochromatin Protein 1, which mediates liquid-liquid phase
separation (LLPS) and may limit access to Pol II. Second, RNAi also recruits ubiquitin ligase, and we
recently found that ubiquitin promotes these phase transitions. RNAi guides histone modification in C.
elegans and Drosophila, but conservation in mammalian systems has been controversial. For example,
piRNAs mediate histone modification in the germline but do not depend on Dicer, while genome
instability in Dicer mutant mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) depends on transcription of satellite
repeats. Strikingly, we have found genome instability in Dicer-/- mESC depends on the transcriptional co-
activator BRD4, and identical in-frame bromodomain deletions rescue Dicer mutants in fission yeast.
S. pombe is an outstanding model system for cell cycle research, and we were the first to show that
RNAi is essential for quiescence (G0). Genetic screens have revealed that nucleolar RNA silencing and
histone modifications mediate this novel function. Our goals in the next five years are to determine the
elusive mechanism by which RNAi guides each aspect of heterochromatin from repeat instability, to
silencing, chromosome segregation and DNA repair as well as survival in quiescence. Our recent work
suggests a central role for long non-coding RNA, R-loops and the activity of RNAse H in the upstream
steps in this pathway. Downstream events include histone modification and LLPS that may underlie the
classically “condensed” properties of heterochromatin. We will use our stem cell model to assess the
conservation and relevance of these mechanisms in health and disease, especially in cancer."

 Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) experienced in early childhood causes long-lasting negative
consequences on brain development, connectivity and cognition. Given the high prevalence of IDA in infants
and toddlers and significant neurocognitive consequences, IDA screening is widely recommended in the first
year of life. However, the brain continues to develop throughout childhood, and the incidence of IDA sharply
increases again in late-childhood among menstruating females, occurring in 1 of every 16 adolescent females.
Of greatest concern, recent studies have found that late-childhood IDA negatively impacts cognitive
performance.
 Anemia results in cerebral metabolic stress with compensatory increases in cerebral blood flow and
oxygen extraction fraction. In severe anemia, the compensatory mechanisms may be inadequate to maintain
the expected metabolic rate of oxygen utilization (CMRO2), impacting the structural and functional
development of the brain. The goal of this proposal is to delineate the short and long-term neurocognitive
impact of late-childhood IDA in young females by testing the central hypothesis that late-childhood IDA causes
cerebral metabolic stress that contributes to both reversible and potentially irreversible changes in
neurocognitive function. Eighty-eight young females between 12-21 years of age with IDA will undergo
cognitive evaluation and brain MRI assessing cerebral metabolism and structural and functional connectivity at
time of diagnosis, 6 weeks after iron repletion, and at 1-year post-enrollment. Forty-four age-matched females
without anemia will be enrolled and assessed at similar time-points for comparison. We will compare cerebral
metabolic stress and compromised metabolism between the two groups (Aim 1). A subgroup of females with
IDA that receive IV iron therapy will have brain MRIs weekly for 6 weeks post-repletion. Dense imaging of this
subgroup will determine the hemoglobin threshold resulting in metabolic failure. The change in functional
connectivity and cognitive abilities with resolution of anemia secondary to iron therapy will be measured to
assess the potential reversibility of neurocognitive dysfunction with iron repletion (Aim 2). Lastly, cognitive
evaluation and brain MRIs one year after enrollment will be used to determine the relationship between
cerebral metabolic stress at diagnosis of IDA and long-term integrity of the white matter microstructure as it
relates to cognitive abilities (Aim 3). Determining the neurocognitive effects of late-childhood IDA has
important implications for potential screening and optimizing therapy recommendations at a time when
cognitive performance has life-long implications for educational and career options for young women entering
adulthood."

Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) occurs when somatic mutations provide a fitness advantage to
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, leading to clonal expansion of mutant blood cells. CH is
highly prevalent in the elderly and has emerged as a major independent risk factor for
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among the common genetic variants of CH,
individuals with JAK2V617F CH have an outstanding risk of myocardial infarction and of venous and
arterial thrombosis. JAK2V617F variants are present in 3-4% of a general European population and
are associated with increased thrombotic risk at very low allele burden. There is no approved
therapy for this risk. We have demonstrated increased atherosclerosis in chimeric mice that model
JAK2V617F CH, involving elevated inflammasome activation and IL-1β production. While
atherosclerosis in CH has been intensively studied, the impact and mechanisms of CH driven
atherothrombosis have not been extensively investigated. Our preliminary studies have shown
accelerated atherothrombosis in Jak2VF CH models. While our studies suggest the underlying
importance of JAK2V617F platelets, myeloid cells and erythrocytes as well as the cross-talk from
mutant to wild type cells in atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis, the relative importance of
different blood cell types and of cross-talk between cell types need to be more rigorously assessed.
We propose to use novel mouse models to interrogate the role of different blood cells and the
relevant pathways and mechanisms involved in accelerated atherosclerosis and
atherothrombosis in JAK2V617F CH. Elucidation of the different proposed mechanisms may lead
to the development of precision therapeutic approaches to reduce atherosclerotic and
atherothrombotic risk in JAK2VF CH."

 Tendinopathy is a tendon disorder that is highly prevalent in the aged population. It is characterized by
tendon deterioration that often leads to tendon rupture, and is associated with pain, swelling and impaired
performance. There is currently no cure for tendinopathy and an urgent need for effective treatments for
tendinopathy. The technology to be developed is microRNA (miR)-221-5p for the treatment of tendinopathy. Our
preliminary studies identified that miR-221-5p exhibited a therapeutic effect in a rodent model of tendinopathy
and may exert its therapeutic effect, at least in part, by suppressing expression of pro-inflammatory mediators
that contribute to the pathogenesis of tendinopathy. This project will test the hypothesis that chemically modified
miR-221-5p exerts an enhanced effect on mitigating tendinopathy. The Phase II study will focus on providing
critical evidence towards developing miR-221-5p as an FDA-approved product for the treatment of tendinopathy.
In Aim 1, we will determine the chemical formulation and treatment condition of miR-221-5p using a collagenase-
induced model of tendinopathy. In Aim 2, we will determine the efficacy and safety of miR-221-5p on
tendinopathy in rabbits. Successful completion of the proposed studies will identify miR-221-5p as a new drug
for the treatment of tendinopathy and other chronic inflammatory diseases."

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that is the leading cause of non-traumatic neurological disability in
young adults. The disease is caused by an aberrant immune-mediated attack on the central nervous system,
which causes tissue destruction and subsequent neurologic disability. Disease course varies greatly from
individual to individual, from relapsing-remitting MS, to primary progressive MS, the latter highly debilitating and
refractory to treatment. MS is three times more common in women, but tends to be more severe in men. MS has
a significant heritable component, with up to 30% of the disease risk being genetically determined. While recent
studies have identified candidate genes that are associated with MS risk, it remains unclear how these genes
work and whether these are truly causative. Additionally, it is completely unknown why some individuals get
different forms of this disease, and why there are differences between men and women. The other 70% of
disease risk comes from environment or gene-by-environment interactions, representing an attractive avenue
for presentation. However, how risk factors, in particular chronic gammaherpes virus infection, mechanistically
impact MS risk or progression is unclear. These types of questions are very difficult, if not impossible, to address
in studies in humans, and in this application, we propose to use animal models of MS. Mouse models offer
powerful genetic tools, and allow for cause/effect mechanistic studies, but conventional mouse models are highly
artificial and lack genetic diversity. We will use several novel mouse genetic models that are designed to better
represent the complex genetic structure of human populations, which will allow us to dissect the complex genetic
architecture underlying MS pathogenesis, to identify specific genes responsible for various poorly understood
aspects of this disease, and to identify gene-by-environment interactions and novel mechanisms underlying
environmental risk factors."

This project uses cutting-edge legal epidemiology techniques to examine population-level maternal and child
health (MCH) impacts of pregnancy termination policies in the U.S., including identifying which groups
experience adverse consequences and the conditions that buffer consequences. Pregnancy termination in the
U.S. is common, with about one out of five pregnancies ending in a termination. Historically, most research
about public health impacts of pregnancy termination policies focused on the relationship between legal status
of pregnancy termination and maternal morbidity and mortality related to illegal versus legal pregnancy
termination. In the U.S. today, however, most pregnancy termination policies do not make all pregnancy
terminations illegal; rather, they create barriers to people being able to terminate their pregnancy. Most states
have at least one such policy and some states have had some pregnancy termination policies for more than 40
years. Recently, though, the number, strength, types, and co-occurrence of such policies have dramatically
changed; some of these policies and policy combinations have contributed to a decrease in the number of
pregnancy terminations. The next few years could bring even more drastic changes in these policies. Such
policy changes could have public health impacts on people who continue their pregnancies and give birth –
particularly on MCH outcomes such as maternal morbidity and mortality, infant mortality, and adverse birth
outcomes. Methodologically rigorous research about impacts of being unable to obtain a pregnancy
termination on subsequent MCH has been conducted at the individual-level. Yet, only very limited research,
much of it with notable methodological limitations, has been conducted at the population-level. This limits our
understanding of population-level impacts of pregnancy termination policies. In this project, we assess whether
state-level pregnancy termination policies from 2005-present affect MCH outcomes. We also examine whether
effects differ by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status as well as by other state-level characteristics such as
economic, gender equality, and structural racism. This study involves state-of-the art coding of our exposure -
state-level pregnancy termination policies from 2005-present, including policy adoption and effective dates.
Outcomes include births and changes in composition of births, as well as MCH outcomes (maternal morbidity
and mortality, preterm birth, low birthweight, and infant mortality). Outcome data will come from insurance
claims data, vital statistics data, and the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. We will use both
epidemiologic and econometric data analysis approaches to allow for causal interpretation of findings. Findings
will provide key evidence to prepare public health and health care systems to care for groups of people most
affected by pregnancy termination policies, as well as identify other state-level policies and characteristics that
might help buffer any adverse MCH impacts of pregnancy termination policies."

sequester essential metals, a phenomenon known as “nutritional immunity.” Ngo subverts nutritional immunity
by using dedicated TonB-dependent transporters (TdTs) that bind to and remove the metals from human metal-
binding proteins such as transferrin and lactoferrin, which sequester iron (Fe). Our preliminary data indicates
that two Ngo outer membrane transporters, TdfH and TdfJ, enable Ngo to internalize zinc (Zn) from Zn-

imposed by the innate immunity protein calprotectin (CP), which is produced in abundance by neutrophils and
accumulates to high concentrations at sites of inflammation. Furthermore, in the prior funding period, we
determined that TdfJ enables the use of S100A7, also known as psoriasin, as the sole Zn source. Two other

 Inflammation and vascular leak are common findings across several pathologies associated
with arrhythmias. These include atrial fibrillation (AF), which affects up to 3% of the US population.
AF progressively worsens, and increases risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease. Thus, we
urgently need novel, mechanistically-driven therapies for AF. Vascular leak in AF patients results
from elevated serum levels of inflammatory cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF). While the thrombogenic impact of vascular leak in AF is widely recognized, its role in
arrhythmogenesis remains unclear. One possible link between vascular leak and arrhythmia may
be myocardial edema. Recent work by the PI demonstrated that edema disrupts sodium channel
(NaV1.5) –rich nanodomains within the intercalated disk (ID), slowing cardiac impulse
propagation, and prompting arrhythmias. In preliminary studies, VEGF (at levels found in the
serum of AF patients) elevated AF inducibility ex vivo and in vivo mouse experiments within 30
minutes. Therefore, we hypothesize that cytokine-induced vascular leak promotes cardiac
edema, and contributes to atrial arrhythmias by disrupting NaV1.5-rich ID nanodomains. In
this venture, we will employ cutting edge tools including super-resolution microscopy, 3D electron
microscopy, and smart patch clamp to investigate the structural and functional impact of vascular
leak on the structure and function of atrial IDs. Furthermore, we will utilize an innovative strategy
peptide mimetics of adhesion domains will be used to selectively modulate the structure of
different ID nanodomains. Aim 1 will use these peptides to investigate how different ID
nanodomains contribute to atrial conduction, and probe fundamental mechanisms underlying
these structure-function relationships. In new preliminary data, we demonstrate that VEGF-
induced vascular leak induces swelling of ID nanodomains and translocation of NaV1.5 from these
sites within 30 minutes. Aim 2 will investigate the acute structural and functional impacts of VEGF-
induced vascular leak. Aim 3 will use ex vivo and in vivo models to test the efficacy of preserving
the vascular barrier and/or ID nanodomains in preventing AF."
10881269,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The alveolus is lined by two epithelial cell types: thin gas-exchanging alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells and cuboidal
surfactant-producing AT2 cells. Both are selected from a common distal progenitor by FGF, Notch, and stretch
signaling. Injury in the adult lung activates AT2 into a facultative progenitor state to regenerate lost AT1 and AT2
cells. While the inductive cues that select fate have been identified, it is less clear what role – if any – repressive
cues play in fate maturation. Two gaps of understanding in the lung field are 1) when and how is stemness lost
after fate selection and 2) once lost, how is stemness re-accessed by AT2s after injury to regenerate the alveolar
epithelium. Our recent work indicates perinatal AT2s retain stemness for weeks after fate selection, despite being
transcriptionally and functionally differentiated. This proposal focuses on a putative repressor of AT2 stemness,
determining its target and modes of action, whether and how it is overridden in adult AT2s to re-access stemness,
and investigating the extent to which it is dysfunctional in pulmonary fibrosis - wherein aberrant AT2 states are
observed. Our first aim focuses on a putative repressor of stemness we identified, the CCAAT enhancer binding
protein C/EBPα. Using transgenic mouse models, we will test the requirement of Cebpa for AT2 stemness and
determine whether the targeted stemness program acts in a cell autonomous or non-autonomous manner by
mosaic deletion. Next, scRNAseq, ATAC- and ChIP-seq will identify genes targeted by, as well as molecules
interacting with, C/EBPα. Finally, we will use organotypic culture and transgenic mouse experiments to determine
whether timing of Cebpa expression is itself regulated earlier in development by the polycomb repressive
complex PRC2. The second aim of the proposal is to determine whether and how C/EBPα regulation is
overridden following injury to re-access AT2 stemness and promote repair. We will determine whether C/EBPα
downregulation and AT2 stemness is dependent on AT1 cell death in vivo by performing genetically targeted cell
type specific ablation. Finally, we will compare the spatiotemporal program of C/EBPα regulation we identify
during injury and repair to the fibrotic lung and investigate whether it is dysfunctional in its associated aberrant
AT2 cells. Our approach is innovative, as no transgenic mouse experiments using mosaic deletion or lineage
tracing have been performed for Cebpa in the lung, nor have precise cell ablation studies been conducted in the
adult lung to study C/EBPα regulation. Further, the observation of retained stemness in perinatal AT2 cells is
novel and thus no investigation has implemented a multi-omics approach to understand its underlying
mechanism. Finally, little is known on the role repressive cues play in AT2 cells differentiation and maturation. If
successful, we will have uncovered a novel mechanism of AT2 stemness regulation for the lung field which will
be informative in understanding pulmonary diseases with aberrant epithelial differentiation. Further, our findings
will guide development of novel diagnostics or therapeutics, either for direct use in patients or in culture to control
stem cell differentiation through reprogramming patient’s adult AT2 cells."
10884357,"Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii infections present an enormous ongoing challenge to public
health. Due to the frequent occurrence of multidrug resistance, current treatment options for A. baumannii
infections are limited. ß-Lactam antibiotics, especially carbapenems, represent the treatment of choice for
susceptible infections. However, carbapenem resistance is increasingly common, and for such infections there
is no consensus on the optimal alternative treatment. Because resistance has hitherto been relatively
uncommon, colistin has become a favored treatment in spite of the fact that deleterious side effects are common.
However, resistance to colistin in A. baumannii is becoming more frequent with the recent dissemination of
plasmid-borne colistin resistance genes (mcr-1-10) into healthcare facilities. Unfortunately, the recent track
record of discovery of new antibiotics that are active against Gram-negative bacteria is exceedingly poor, which,
coupled with the exit of Big Pharma from antibiotic discovery, has made the development of new therapies and
non-traditional therapeutic approaches vital. To combat this growing threat, we initiated a research program to
identify small molecules, termed antibiotic adjuvants, that potentiate the activity of macrolides against MDR A.
baumannii. To this end, we have successfully identified molecules that lower the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) of clarithromycin up to 512-fold against all members of a panel of primary clinical A.
baumannii isolates from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) that encompasses nearly all
clinically relevant A. baumannii clades. Adjuvants also potentiate the activity of vancomycin up to 256-fold. Both
macrolides and vancomycin are typically viewed as “Gram-positive” selective antibiotics due to their inability to
cross the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, Mechanistic studies have led to a working hypothesis that
these compounds overcome this barrier by increasing permeability of the outer membrane through inhibiting
lipooligosaccharide (LOS) production. Combinations of adjuvant with clarithromycin are effective in a Galleria
mellonella model of infection, which has been shown to predict outcome in murine models of infection in the
context of MDR A. baumannii. Therefore, combinations of such adjuvants with either clarithromycin or
vancomycin may form the basis for an efficacious approach to treating MDR A. baumannii infections for which
there are no effective antibiotics."
10883000,"The adrenal cortex continuously remodels in response to physiological cues, though the precise cellular and
molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our prior studies show that the adrenal cortex undergoes
zonal transdifferentiation during postnatal development in the zona Glomerulosa (zG) gives rise to the zona
Fasciculata (zF). This process involves formation and resolution of multicellular zG-rosettes via the adherens
junction(AJ)-aCatenin complex. How these structures regulate aldosterone production and how dysregulation
leads to disease is not known. Given that primary aldosteronism (PA), the most common form of endocrine
hypertension, involves hyperplasic expansion of zG-rosettes, further study of the factors and signaling pathways
involved in regulating zG development and maintenance is warranted. Utilizing a zG-specific b-catenin gain-of-
function mouse model, we have shown that zG hyperplasia in PA is driven by a block in rosette
resolution/transdifferentiation. In addition, this block involves up regulation of FGFR2 signaling, which is required
for rosette formation during normal development. Further, we have found that rosettes act as a coordinating
center for Ca2+ signaling, via the AJ-aCatenin complex, and subsequent aldosterone production. We also
discovered that WNT2B, recently identified by GWAS analysis as a major risk allele for PA, is a novel regulator
of aldosterone production and zG homeostasis. Based on our recent findings, it is increasing evident that further
study of the role of AJs, rosettes and the signals that control them is necessary. Thus, we propose the following:
 Aim 1. Define how WNT2B mediates zG morphogenesis and function.
 Aim 2. Determine how a-Catenin and AJs mediate zG morphogenesis and function.
 Aim 3. Establish how FGFR2 regulates zG morphogenesis and function.
 These studies seek to understand the regulatory mechanisms that control zG function during postnatal
development and maintenance. The successful completion of these studies will provide critical insights into the
mechanisms that govern zG homeostasis and the initiation and progression of PA, which may lead to new
targeted therapies for this disease."
10883283,"Recent findings from clinical trials of pharmacological interventions in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) such as lecanemab have shown a significant slowing of clinical decline in early-stage patients. However, potentially serious side effects such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) caused by brain swelling and bleeding highlight the importance of detecting AD early in its course so that treatment can (1) be applied when it is most effective, prior to widespread neuronal loss, and (2) avoid potentially harmful side effects in patients that would not benefit from treatment. Thus, for effective treatment of AD it is critical that we develop sensitive and specific surrogate biomarkers that accurately distinguish subjects with AD from other populations as early as possible in the course of the disease, as well as quantify the impacts of AD on brain anatomy. Unfortunately, this is a difficult undertaking using images of an individual at a single time point due to the enormous variability in normal human neuroanatomy, which can obscure disease processes. Compared to a cross-sectional approach, a longitudinal design can provide more sensitivity and specificity for examining subtle associations by reducing the confounding effect of between-subject variability. Moreover, a serial assessment can be the only way to unambiguously characterize the effect of interest in a randomized experiment, such as a drug trial. Finally, longitudinal studies can provide unique insights into the temporal dynamics of the biological processes underlying AD disease progression. Taking full advantage of a longitudinal design requires the optimization of the computational tools that perform image processing and hypothesis testing. In this project, we propose to design, develop, and distribute Deep Learning-based, intrinsically longitudinal image processing tools that incorporate models summarizing the neuroanatomical effects of AD progression. Specifically, we will develop a model of the temporal effects of AD on brain anatomy allowing us to classify AD patients from controls and subjects with other neurodegenerative diseases, then embed that model into a longitudinal segmentation framework, resulting in a set of open-source and publicly distributed algorithms that are specifically designed to be optimal for diagnosing and quantifying the effects of AD. These tools will then be provided to the ADNI community and applied to ADNI data, as we have done in the past."

 Malaysia’s HIV epidemic is rapidly expanding with recent evidence suggesting accelerated sexual
transmission, especially in MSM: 10% in 2008 to 54% in 2016. Evidence suggests high HIV prevalence in MSM
being nationally (21.6%) and in Kuala Lumpur (43%). Central to this expanding HIV epidemic in MSM is
condomless sex, STIs, and co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders (P/SUD), especially depression
and amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) use. Insights into Malaysia’s HIV prevention gap are multi-factorial.
Both homosexuality and substance use is criminalized in Malaysia, making MSM bear the dual burden of stigma
and discrimination, including in healthcare, which promotes P/SUD disparities in MSM. MSM are often hesitant
to disclose their sexuality, risk behaviors or depressive symptoms, mostly due to fear of stigma, discrimination,
or criminalization. Stigma and discrimination are also enacted on MSM by healthcare providers resulting in
extraordinary health disparities and low prevention uptake. Strategies that facilitate screening and prevention
practices in a non-judgmental fashion are likely to increase access to evidence-based prevention like HIV testing
and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), especially if screening and counseling addresses P/SUD. Introducing an
innovative app-based platform to deliver holistic HIV prevention services represents a paradigm shift in HIV
prevention since it can deliver effective prevention in a confidential, less-stigmatizing and convenient manner.
Building on the advantages for scalability and dissemination afforded using app platform, we propose to develop
and test the efficacy of a clinic-affiliated app (myCareLink) to deliver an integrated HIV prevention intervention
that will promote HIV testing and linkage to PrEP and incorporates screening and support for underlying P/SUD
in Malaysian MSM. The design of this study will take place in 2 phases. The R21 phase will consist of 2 stages: 1)
We will adapt, expand and refine an existing app, which will be integrated within the existing clinical care system.
First, we will conduct focus groups with MSM (n=25) and stakeholders (n=10) to theater test the existing app to
develop an interactive prototype of the myCareLink app (alpha version). Then, the prototype will undergo
usability testing (n=20), followed by the full development of the app (beta version); 2) Expanded Beta testing
(n=50) of the myCareLink app will assess its usability and acceptability. The R33 phase will involve conducting
a Type 1 Hybrid Implementation Science Trial to evaluate the efficacy of myCareLink app vs. treatment as usual
(TAU) in 268 Malaysian MSM for primary (HIV testing and PrEP uptake) and secondary (PrEP adherence and
persistence) efficacy outcomes. Multi-level implementation outcomes will involve stakeholders’ perspective of
the relative advantage of myCareLink app over TAU, adaptability, perceived design quality and packaging,
compatibility in the Malaysian context, interest in sharing the app with others and readiness for implementation.
Research capacity strengthening between Yale and the University of Malaya will occur through collaborative
learning between researchers at both institutions to promote expansion of mHealth research."

Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are critical facets of the
human immune system. Interactions of KIR, expressed by natural killer cells (NK cells), with HLA class I,
expressed by most tissue cells, modulate immune cell functions. Variations in the highly polymorphic KIR and
HLA genes are linked directly to NK cell functions and have profound impact on human health, including
associations with autoimmunity and neurological disease, severity of infectious disease, pregnancy
syndromes, and risk of cancer. Our ability to resolve the mechanisms of immune-mediated disease, to develop
personalized medicines, including immunotherapies, and to match organ donors with recipients relies on our
ability to accurately characterize KIR and HLA class I diversity. Despite this crucial importance, there is a lack
of knowledge concerning the extent and nature of KIR and HLA class I diversity worldwide. This deficit includes
the Eastern Hemisphere, which encompasses half the world's population, and multiple underrepresented
groups in the USA. During this project we will fill these gaps in this knowledge through determining the
characteristics and functional consequences of KIR and HLA class I diversity across the entire Eastern
Hemisphere.
We will examine 15,612 individuals representing 51 discrete populations, including indigenous populations
from East Asia, South Asia, multiple Pacific Islands and Oceania. To overcome difficulties in analyzing these
complex genomic regions, we developed a targeted sequencing and bioinformatics approach to analyze KIR
and HLA class I genes at high throughput and resolution. To analyze an additional 22,905 individuals, we will
develop an imputation algorithm to determine high-resolution KIR alleles from whole-genome SNP data. We
will construct imputation panels specifically for these populations who have been neglected in previous
analyses. This goal will be made possible through the extensive training data generated. We will then
characterize the distribution of KIR and HLA haplotypes across the Eastern Hemisphere.
We will examine how the geographic patterns of KIR and HLA diversity have been shaped by natural selection
and investigate the impact of adaptive introgression and admixture specifically focused to the KIR and HLA loci
in our study populations. We will determine the functional properties of those variants we have identified as
targeted by natural selection. We will pursue these aims implementing innovative laboratory and analytical
tools. These developments include CRISPR/cas9 targeting of long-read sequencing to examine KIR structural
diversity, and methods both to identify alleles subject to natural selection, and the mode of selection acting on
them. The expected outcome of this work is the genetic and functional characterization of HLA and KIR across
multiple human populations, and a comprehensive understanding of how this variation is geographically
distributed and shaped by natural selection. This work will benefit investigations of immune-mediated and
infectious disease and in establishment of personalized treatments for individuals both in the USA and
worldwide."

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects 26% of adults over age 30 and is associated with significant
morbidity and mortality. At the time of presentation, African American have more severe OSA and have
more associated complications compared to other groups. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
is an effective treatment for OSA that improves sleepiness and quality of life in a dose response fashion.
Therefore, it is recommended that patients use it whenever they sleep. However, CPAP use among
African Americans is low. Many patients with OSA visit a health care provider at the urging of their bed
partners who themselves may be experiencing decreased sleep and quality of life due to their partners’
OSA. We reasoned that bed partners may positively effect CPAP adherence. We conducted interviews
of African American patients with OSA and their bed partners. They recommended a couple-oriented
intervention to increase CPAP adherence. With their help we developed a couple-oriented behavioral
therapy intervention.
We now propose a full scale randomized controlled trial involving 220 African American patients with
OSA of 2 large, urban healthcare systems and their bed partners. Patients randomized to the usual care
arm will receive a CPAP machine and supplies with standardized OSA and CPAP education from a
certified sleep technician. Patients and bed partners in the intervention arm will also receive a CPAP
machine and supplies with standardized education regarding OSA and CPAP from a certified sleep
technician. In addition, patients and partners will receive tailored text messages encouraging CPAP
adherence. The couples will receive five 1-hour virtual cognitive behavioral couple therapy sessions with
a behavioral sleep psychologist. Primary analyses will compare CPAP adherence at 1 year. Secondary
analyses will compare CPAP adherence at 1, 3, and 6 months. We will also measure the duration and
quality of sleep, functional status, and quality of life of patients and their bed partners.
Novel features of the proposed project include a rigorous randomized controlled trial design, short- and
long-term follow-up, and remotely monitoring of daily CPAP adherence data directly from the machines.
The project has the potential not only to improve patient sleep and well-being but also to improve the
sleep and well-being of their bed partners. Furthermore, it may serve as a model for future trials of
couple-oriented therapy among patients with other sleep disorders."
10882565,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
With repeated Plasmodium infections, children eventually gain the ability to tolerate Plasmodium parasitemia
without developing symptoms. However, preventing malaria with effective chemoprevention may delay
development of this clinical immunity, such that children are at increased risk of more severe disease following
cessation. Although mechanisms controlling development of clinical immunity remain unclear, effector and
regulatory CD4+ T cells play a critical role in orchestrating a coordinated immune response to pathogens
including malaria. Plasmodium-specific Type 1 regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tr1) are a specialized, tolerogenic CD4
subset that expand following Plasmodium infection in humans and mice, although genetic mechanisms that
support Tr1 differentiation and maintenance remain unresolved. It also remains unclear whether these
represent clonal expansions, contribute to a stable memory pool, and/or play a role in mediating clinical
immunity to subsequent Plasmodium infections. We hypothesize that clonal populations of Plasmodium-
specific Tr1 cells expand following Plasmodium infection, are critical mediators of clinical immunity to
repeated infection, and are limited by effective chemoprevention. To test our hypotheses, we will leverage
two extraordinary and complementary cohorts to longitudinally and comprehensively analyze the CD4+ T cell
response in children. In Aim 1, we will analyze samples already obtained from children enrolled in the
Ugandan International Centers of Excellence in Malaria cohorts before, during, and at multiple time points
following a single and repeated malaria infection. We will study CD4+ T cell population dynamics within the
same child over time using innovative single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic approaches that we have
optimized. We will predict genes and other genetic loci that support or suppress Tr1 responses in children, and
determine associations with antibody responses and clinical phenotypes of infection. In Aim 2, we will analyze
samples collected as part of the Modifying Immunity in Children with Dihydroartemisin-Piperaquine (MIC-DroP)
clinical trial, in which 924 infants are being randomized to receive artemisinin-based chemoprevention vs.
placebo from birth to 2 years of age, then followed to 4 years of age. We will determine whether preventing
repeated infection interferes with Tr1 development, and whether specific malaria-specific CD4+ T cell
populations correlate with clinical outcomes following the cessation of chemoprevention. Finally, to
complement the pediatric studies, in Aim 3 we will perform studies of experimental re-infection and
chemoprevention in mice, since these systems permit detailed analysis of CD4+ T cell dynamics in the first few
hours and days after a reinfection event, and can assess organ-specific CD4+ responses in both the spleen
and liver. This study of Plasmodium-specific CD4+ T cell dynamics in humans and mice will provide critical
insight into how the adaptive immune system tolerates foreign antigens, and lay the foundation for the
development of therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing disease severity and/or enhancing parasite clearance."
10881402,"SUMMARY
Intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by deficits
in cognitive and adaptive functioning, with onset before adulthood. Individuals with IDD face substantive social,
healthcare, and health disparities. In recent years, multiple studies have reported an increased risk of adverse
maternal, birth and infant outcomes associated with any IDD diagnosis. To date, the risk associated with specific
diagnoses and the underlying causes of these excess risks have not been elucidated, although researchers have
hypothesized that chronic disease, adverse reproductive factors such as smoking or inadequate prenatal care,
and pregnancy complications could explain the risk. Without quantifying these mediating pathways, it is unclear
where to target intervention efforts to optimize maternal and infant outcomes. To address this gap, we propose
a study with the overarching objective to (1) leverage large-scale administrative data to elucidate the factors
contributing to adverse maternal and infant outcomes for women with IDD, and (2) conduct causal
mediation analyses, accounting for multiple mediators, to establish empirically derived intervention
targets. In order to achieve this objective, we will do the following: characterize the pathways between IDD
subtypes and adverse maternal outcomes (Aim 1); characterize the pathways between IDD subtypes and
adverse birth and infant outcomes (Aim 2), quantify the multiple factors that mediate maternal and infant
outcomes among women with IDD diagnoses (Aim 3). We will use data from the Study of Mothers and Infants,
an administrative birth cohort consisting of all live born (n=6.7 million) and stillborn (n=26,922) deliveries in
California between 2007-2021 in which birth records are linked to maternal and infant hospital summaries, infant
and fetal death records, and in a subset, California Medicaid records. This will allow us to perform causal
mediation analyses to quantify the extent to which chronic comorbidities, reproductive factors, or prescription
medications mediate associations between IDD subtypes and adverse maternal and birth outcomes. Through
this research, we will greatly expand the conceptual framework of reproductive health in women with IDD,
allowing for targeted interventions to be interrogated in future work."

Learning when to fear and when not to fear significantly impacts how we interact with our environment. Failure
to appropriately regulate fear in situations that should be considered safe can be observed in stress disorders,
such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Even in individuals without a stress disorder, arousal is
positively correlated with how threatening a safety cue is perceived. Restoring compromised behavioral control
over fear under safety/threat conflict appears to rely on the strength of the safety cue as an inhibitor. This
effectiveness as an inhibitor is critical to understand as presenting safety cues during exposure therapy could
potentially enhance treatment outcomes in reducing maladaptive fear. However, the neural circuits promoting
adaptive responding to safety cues that are well discriminated from fear cues are poorly understood.
Therefore, identifying the behavioral and neural circuit mechanisms that regulate safety signaling is a critical
and unmet medical need. Our extensive experience with safety conditioning paradigms makes us the
best qualified to complete the proposed experiments. More specifically, we have the technical ability to
articulate the essential neural circuitry for discriminating amongst safety, fear and reward cues, as well as
conditioned inhibition of fear and reward.
Our prior work has shown separate networks exist within the infralimbic cortex (IL) and basolateral amygdala
(BLA) that either respond selectively to safety under threat conflict (safety-specific), or respond to both the
safety conflict and reward cue (safety/reward). We propose that safety-specific signaling is encoded within the
BLA and IL inputs to the central amygdala (CeA) (Aim 1), while the overlapping safety/reward signal is within
the BLA, IL, and prelimbic (PL) inputs to the nucleus accumbens (NAC) (Aim 2). We also propose that the
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) will participate in the transfer of the fear
reducing effects of a learned safety cue to novel contexts since they have been implicated in generalizing
memories across contexts and integrating cues with contexts (Aim 3). In the proposed work we will be
following individual cells longitudinally across reward cue learning, safety cue discrimination learning, tests for
conditioned inhibition, cued fear extinction, and retardation of fear acquisition to determine how individual cells
of this circuit generalize across different types of cued safety, cued reward and new contexts. Together, this
work will impact the field of safety learning by identifying and teasing apart circuit mechanisms of how a safety
cue suppresses fear, how it gains rewarding properties, and how it may regulate fear in unfamiliar contexts, all
of which are highly relevant to many psychiatric disorders. In sum, we have a unique and novel translational
approach to better understand the neural mechanisms of conditional discrimination that may be negatively
affected in many psychiatric disorders."

Motion effects (including respiratory motion, body motion, cardiac motion) and associated mismatched
attenuation correction substantially degrade the cardiac PET image quality and quantitative accuracy. Although
a number of motion correction methods have been implemented on clinical scanners, they 1) are largely
respiratory motion corrections requiring external motion tracking hardware; and 2) does not take into account
motion-induced PET-CT mismatch in attenuation correction. The correction of motion for 82Rb cardiac dynamic
PET imaging is particularly challenging, as the rapid tracer kinetics of 82Rb leads to substantial tracer distribution
change in the dynamic frame images over time. 82Rb’s ultra-short half-life of only 75 seconds also poses
additional significant challenges of image noise.
In this R01, we propose to develop a series of motion correction methods with aligned PET-CT for both static
and dynamic cardiac applications. All the new developments proposed here are data-driven based approaches,
meaning no external motion tracking hardware is required. We will focus on cardiac PET data with 82Rb as the
tracer, while most of the developments can be directly applied to other tracers. The proposed motion correction
technology developments and translations will have a significant impact on both currently used clinical protocols
and emerging new applications, such as evaluation of endocardial/epicardial (EN/EP) flow ratios. Specifically, in
Aim 1, we will develop and optimize respiratory and bulk body motion correction methods. In Aim 2, we will
develop and optimize data-driven methods to correct cardiac (intra-beat) motion. In Aim 3, we will develop
methods to correct PET/CT mis-alignment due to motion. All the developed technologies will be evaluated and
validated using human and large animal data. In Aim 4, the industry partner of this grant will translate the
developed motion correction methods to end-users."

Recent progress in cell imaging and molecular fluorescent tags has provided opportunities to
perform a wide variety of cell-based assays using cell imagers. Experiments that previously
required fluorescent microscopes on a slide-by-slide basis can now be run in a high through-put
format up to 384 samples at a time and quantified using new algorithms and software which saves
time and resources. In the St. Mary's University Biology department, all students take the Cell
and Molecular Methods laboratory course during their sophomore year to introduce them to
advanced biological techniques such as cell imaging and cell-based assays. Previous assays
have been performed using our fluorescent microscopes but were time-consuming and were
limited by the number of microscopes available. Here, we propose that the Incucyte SX5 Live-
Cell Analysis system will provide advanced, high throughput, and more variety of cell-based
assays. It Is a versatile imaging system that combines bright field and fluorescent channels for
comprehensive whole-well live-cell imaging. Its advanced software package allows for accurate
data quantification and analysis, supporting various biological assays such as apoptosis, cell
cycle, and cytotoxicity. Operating within a standard tissue culture incubator, it maintains precise
environmental control, enabling uninterrupted incubation and simultaneous imaging of up to six
microplates. The user-friendly software facilitates experiment setup, visual inspection, and the
generation of publication-ready graphs. Additionally, it provides fluorescence calibration,
seamless networked access, and ample data storage capacity for efficient data management.
This imaging system would provide an opportunity for our researchers and students involved in a
variety of biology areas to perform advanced high-throughput experiments. In this proposal, we
outline biology faculty that would utilize the instrument in their research and teaching labs.
Additionally, future collaborations with other departments including engineering, chemistry, and
environmental science may find this imager useful as well. Furthermore, this system will provide
our faculty with a powerful tool to generate high-quality data, facilitating the preparation of future
NIH-funded grant proposals and driving the advancement of biomedical research on our campus.
Aligned with our mission, commitment to diversity, and dedication to excellence in teaching and
research, the addition of a live cell imager at St. Mary's University represents a significant step
forward in advancing cutting-edge research in biology and STEM fields. Empowering our faculty
and students with state-of-the-art technology will enable us to make substantial contributions to
the scientific community and shape the future of biomedical research."
10883408,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease affecting more than 1 in 500 individuals and is an unmet
medical need with limited FDA-approved treatments. ~40% of HCM cases are associated with mutations in
the gene encoding cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C). MyBP-C is a thick filament-associated
protein that is critical for normal myocardial performance and centrally positioned in the sarcomere to regulate
interactions between myosin and actin responsible for force development. We previously demonstrated that
increased phosphorylation of MyBP-C, enhances actin-myosin interactions to accelerate contraction kinetics in
myocardium, whereas the decreased MyBP-C phosphorylation, reduces actin-myosin proximity and decelerate
contraction. However, it is remains unknown how MyBP-C functions under varied states, including myofilament
activation, phosphorylation, and HCM mutations. The structural dynamics of MyBP-C and its interactions with
actin and/or myosin to modulate force development in myocardium are key to understanding this mechanism of
action. We have developed innovative biophysical tools that, for the first time, enable determination of these
mechanisms by evaluation of: (1) MyBP-C structural dynamics, (2) how it interacts with actin and myosin in
relaxed and activated muscle, (3) how these interactions are affected by phosphorylation and (4) known
pathologic mutations. We will test the central hypothesis that MyBP-C function is determined by dynamic
structural changes of its domains that determine interactions of MyBP-C with thin (actin) and thick (myosin)
filaments and that the equilibrium of these interactions is affected by phosphorylation and HCM mutations. The
proposed aims further develop our innovative biophysical tools to measure structural dynamics underlying MyBP-
C regulation of contraction in normal and diseased states. These tools include site-directed fluorescence
spectroscopy, computational simulations, thin and thick filament function, and mechanical measurements. We
will examine how the activation state of the myocardium (Aim 1), phosphorylation of MyBP-C (Aim 2), and HCM
mutations (Aim 3) affect MyBP-C’s structural dynamics and interactions to modulate cardiac contractility. The
proposed studies resolve interactions in real myocardial space and capture structural dynamics in real time using
high-resolution approaches during the contractile cycle. This involves monitoring distances between points on
proteins and the order (or disorder) of those distances under physiological conditions, in interacting proteins and
functioning myocardium. Fluorescence lifetime data components, thin and thick filament activation, mechanics,
and simulations will be used to define models of MyBP-C regulation. The proposed aims offer unprecedented
mechanistic resolution of MyBP-C for its functions in health and HCM disease. This mechanistic understanding
is critical to lay the foundation for determining the qualitative and quantitative impact of MyBP-C-targeted drugs
that are currently being identified by our group for the development of new therapies to treat HCM and other
cardiac disorders."

In many areas of the world, children are regularly exposed to environmental chemicals. During any given period of life, children will experience exposure to many chemicals at the same time. The effects of such mixtures
of chemicals on the molecular underpinnings of the disease process, such as oxidative stress (OS) or on functional endpoints such as cognitive functions, are not well understood in children. There is also little understating of the extent to which endogenous antioxidant defenses in children's bodies or exogenous antioxidants
buffer the effects of chemical mixtures on children's health. The few studies on this topic to date have been
mostly cross-sectional or limited to small numbers of chemicals. To address these gaps, the proposed study
will leverage the Salud Ambiental Montevideo (SAM) cohort in Uruguay, which has enrolled 679 1st-grade children between years 2012-19. Currently, children range in age 7-15 years and have been followed-up for 0-5 years, depending on year of enrollment. Exposure to chlorpyrifos and pyrethroids pesticides has been characterized in a sub-sample of children using urinary metabolites of the pesticides. Exposure to metals in this cohort is generally low. In a cross-sectional pilot study of SAM participants, a metal mixture was linked to higher
levels of oxidative DNA damage and with lower performance on a test of general cognitive abilities. The proposed study will consist of 3 years of follow-up of SAM children to annually characterize the levels of metals in
blood and urine, and metabolites of chlorpyrifos, pyrethroids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in
urine. Each year, urinary biomarkers of OS (F2-isoprostane and 8-OHdG), serum antioxidant enzymes (GPx
and PON1), and serum antioxidant vitamins (vitamin C, carotenoids, retinol, etc). will be measured. A sub-sample of ~100 children will participate in a year-long intensive (monthly) assessment of OS biomarkers to characterize short-term fluctuations in biomarkers and their biological predictors. Children will complete assessments
of executive functions (EF) in Y2 and Y3 of the study. Leveraging data collected at enrollment into SAM (T0, ~7y), chemical mixtures will be constructed in statistical machine learning models for four time points: T0 and Y1-3 of the proposed study. These mixtures will be modeled to understand how exposure to mixtures over time is
associated with OS and EF. Potential effect modification by antioxidants will be tested. The proposed activities
align with the 2018-23 NIEHS strategic plan of research on the exposome to promote human health through
the advancement of environmental health sciences. Specifically, they will: 1) advance the basic understanding
of short (1 yr) and medium-term (3 yrs) fluctuations in biomarkers of OS and antioxidant defenses, which have
not been investigated in children; 2) contribute to understanding of the extent to which chemical mixtures in
early-middle childhood affect a molecular process (OS) thought to underlie the development of chronic disease, as well as functional endpoints that underlie children's learning and social interactions."

Prescription opioid narcotics, such as morphine, oxycodone, and fentanyl, produce analgesia and side
effects through activation of the mu opioid receptor (MOR), a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR). Our long-
standing goal is to understand how MOR signals to produce distinct biological effects and to ultimately
influence the development of therapeutics that will take advantage of “good” receptor signaling (pain relief)
and avoid “bad” receptor signaling that leads to unwanted opioid side effects like respiratory suppression and
tolerance. It has become increasingly evident that different drug structures can elicit different receptor
signaling cascades at a single receptor, likely by changing the affinities for association with intracellular
binding partners. Over the past decade, we have developed a series of agonists that act in a manner that
drives G protein signaling downstream of MOR and induce little interactions between the receptor and
arrestin2, a scaffolding protein. Moreover, we have determined that several of these agonists produce
antinociception without inducing respiratory suppression. One compound, SR-17108 has been shown to be
potent and efficacious in a neuropathic pain model where it performed better than oxycodone or morphine.
Chronic treatment with SR-17018 did not lead to tolerance in the mouse models. Extensive biochemical
studies have recently revealed that at least 4 agonists from this class, including SR-17018, are binding to
different sites on the receptor and are therefore noncompetitive or allosteric agonists. In this proposal, we
want to determine if it is this noncompetitive property, or other pharmacological properties that the
compounds possess that confer the favorable physiological profiles. Further, we are seeking to determine
the binding site of these compounds. Since the compounds bind to different sites on the receptor than
conventional opioid drugs, we will ask how the allosteric compounds interact with morphine, fentanyl and
naloxone when administered together."

Moderate (<60%) O2 (hyperoxia) in premature infants promotes bronchial airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR)
via effects on airway smooth muscle (ASM), a cell type that also contributes to impaired bronchodilation, and
remodeling (proliferation, altered extracellular matrix (ECM)). Thus understanding mechanisms by which
O2 affects bronchial airways is critical for therapeutic strategies in a vulnerable population. We focus on
a novel, targetable mechanism in ASM: cellular senescence (Sen). Sen cells are long-living, and secrete
factors (senescence-associated secretory phenotype; SASP) that promote inflammation and fibrosis via
paracrine effects on naïve cells. Appeal lies in novel drugs that kill Sen cells (senolytics) such as
dasatanib+quercetin (D+Q) and fisetin. Little is known regarding Sen cells in perinatal airways but our data
indicate moderate O2 enhances detrimental Sen in human fetal ASM (fASM) with increased inflammatory, pro-
fibrotic SASP that promotes proliferation and ECM of naïve ASM: effects inhibited by D+Q. We find that ROS
and ER stress promote fASM Sen, and in newborn mice exposed to O2 (which results in AHR and fibrosis)
D+Q alleviates O2 effects. Thus, we hypothesize perinatal O2 induces detrimental Sen cell burden that,
via SASP, initiates and promotes AHR and remodeling: effects alleviated by senolytics. We propose 3
Aims using human fetal lung and in vivo neonatal mouse models of O2: Aim 1: Determine mechanisms by
which hyperoxia induces cellular Sen in developing human ASM; Aim 2: Determine the role of cellular Sen in
hyperoxia effects on developing human ASM; Aim 3: Determine effects of detrimental Sen on contractility and
remodeling in mouse model of neonatal hyperoxia. In Aims 1 and 2, we will use 18-22 wk gestation human
fASM and lung slices to examine mechanisms of Sen induction, focusing on ROS, mitochondria and ER stress
(Aim 1) and downstream effects of Sen/SASP in the context of contractility and remodeling (Aim 2) following
40% O2. Alleviation by senolytics D+Q or fisetin (Aim 1, 2) are explored. In vitro studies are integrated in the
newborn mouse model (Aim 3) where extent of Sen is assessed, and alleviation of airway hyperreactivity and
remodeling by senolytics are tested. Clinical significance lies in establishing detrimental Sen in O2 effects on
developing airway towards future therapeutic targeting for neonatal asthma."
10879104,"SUMMARY
In 2019, ~100 million Americans were obese, fueling increases in obesity-related morbidity, mortality, and health
care costs, largely from cardiometabolic diseases (CMD). Large scale genetic studies have laid the foundation
for many downstream investigations into the pathogenesis of disease and the translation of this information into
public health applications. Over the last decade genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have substantially
improved our understanding of the genetic architecture of obesity related traits. The potential of these study
findings cannot be overstated for elucidating the biological or pathophysiological underpinnings of obesity and
its costly morbidities. Although GWAS on common variants have made strides in identifying > 1,000 signals
for obesity related traits, these studies are inherently limited without further translation into more actionable
findings. In this proposal, we will narrow association signals and map causal genes and pathways underlying
known obesity risk loci by applying innovative methods to integrate multiple OMICs (genOMICs,
epigenOMICs, transcriptOMICs and metabolOMICs). Additionally, we will explore the clinical relevance of
obesity susceptibility variants, genes, and pathways in a large BioBank linked to electronic health records (EHR)
to validate expected phenotypic associations and reveal novel phenotypic associations. Finally, we will conduct
in vitro functional studies of key variants and genes in physiologically relevant cells to reveal putative regulatory
mechanisms of variants and effects on metabolites and thus the underlying mechanisms critical to obesity
pathogenesis. Thus, in this proposal we leverage collaborations in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in
Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE), TransOMICs for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, the Genome
Sequencing Project (GSP), and the EHR database from the Geisinger MyCODE Community Health Initiative
study (MyCode) to narrow in on genes underlying GWAS signals, perform clinical characterization, and
conduct in vitro functional studies to characterize the molecular underpinnings and biological
mechanisms of obesity-risk loci. Our approach will substantially move the field away from tag variants and loci
to causal variants, genes, and mechanisms. We anticipate that this work will generate fundamental and important
insights into the underlying etiology of obesity and ultimately point the way forward towards prevention and
treatment."
10878841,"Project Summary/Abstract
The development of stem cell-based therapies for curing disease and restoring organ function has led to a critical
need to identify endogenous stem cells and their regulators in craniofacial tissues. We have made significant
inroads into deciphering stem cell identity and regulation in the salivary gland, a craniofacial organ system
profoundly affected by chronic diseases (e.g., aging, autoimmunity, cancer) for which there are few symptomatic
treatments and no long-term restorative therapies. However, despite progress in the field, we are still very much
in the early stages of understanding the mechanisms driving organ repair and regeneration. Thus, based our
previous studies revealing the identity and function of salivary progenitors and novel roles of cholinergic nerves
in morphogenic and renewal programs, we seek to elucidate the mechanisms driving salivary gland regeneration
by exploring 4 significant questions: (1) How do salivary stem cells enable organ renewal? (2) How do nerves
control organ homeostasis and regeneration? (3) How does aging impact salivary stem cells? And finally, (4)
How is salivary gland architecture created? We will answer these questions using a combination of
developmental and regenerative approaches in mice and human tissue together with a bevy of molecular,
biochemical, imaging and cell biological assays. Outcomes here will uncover novel cellular and molecular
mechanisms required for the development of stem cell based therapeutics for reversing damage in these and
other organ systems."
10877374,"In the United States, Spanish-English bilingual children with speech sound disorders do not have equitable
access to the efficient treatment options currently available for their monolingual English-speaking peers. This
is a significant barrier to optimal outcomes for a large and underserved population in this country, considering
that nearly 1 in 4 children in the US lives in a household where a language other than English is spoken. When
children enter kindergarten with delayed speech development, they are more likely to struggle with language,
reading, and academic achievement. This can have long-term effects on their psychosocial well-being and
future employment outcomes. By improving the efficiency of treatment for speech sound disorders, we have
the potential to greatly improve outcomes for these children and also reduce strain on healthcare and special
education resources. Previous studies have shown that teaching English-speaking children more difficult
speech sounds, like consonant sequences, such as ""fr"" in ""free,"" leads to broader improvements in their
speech. They not only learn the targeted sounds but also simpler sounds like ""ch,"" ""th,"" ""v,"" ""g,"" and ""k."" This
suggests that teaching more complex sounds can have an efficient impact on the entire sound system, even
on sounds that were not directly practiced. However, in order to apply this approach to Spanish-English
bilingual children, we must answer two important questions. First, we need to determine if teaching complex
sounds results in similar overall improvements in speech when bilingual children receive treatment in either
Spanish or English. Second, because bilingual children are simultaneously developing two languages, we
need to understand if teaching more complex speech sounds in one language has a broader impact, not only
on the targeted language but also on the untreated language. To address these questions, we will conduct a
Phase I Clinical Trial using single-subject experimental design with a) complex and b) simple treatment
conditions. This design allows us to observe, for bilingual speech treatment, the extent of system-wide
improvement and across-language transfer resulting from complex treatment targets. The treatment will be
provided in Spanish (Aim 1) and English (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will analyze the data gathered from Aims 1 and
2 to explore how specific Spanish or English sounds interact with different treatment targets. This analysis will
help us to understand the mechanisms of broad phonological change across different languages. The
implications for this research are potentially far-reaching. By uncovering the cross-linguistic mechanisms
involved in broad-based phonological learning, we can better understand how complexity influences the
transfer of skills across languages. This research would establish a foundation from which to develop more
efficient and equitable speech treatment procedures that are appropriate for monolingual and bilingual children,
thereby better meeting the needs of the increasingly diverse population with speech sound disorders."
10874295,"Project Summary/Abstract
The superior colliculus (SC) is a sensorimotor mammalian midbrain structure that integrates multimodal
sensory input and guides our everyday responses to environmental cues and determines what events are
most relevant and deserve our attention. Accumulating evidence has implicated the SC in
neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and in neurodegenerative
disorders, such as Lewy body dementia, Parkinson disease, progressive supranuclear palsy etc.
Establishing a functional neurocircuitry that leads to proper behavioral responses requires correct neuronal
differentiation and specification during development. One mechanism thought to regulate neuronal
differentiation is the reduction-oxidation (redox) state of the cell. Regulation of the redox state of a cell can
be crucial in inducing protein modifications, therefore regulating their function in cells and tissues. In a
recent paper, our labs showed that treatment of the developing zebrafish embryos/larvae with the drug
valproic acid (VPA) led to 1) delay in the specification of neurons in the homologous, non-mammalian
structure of the SC, named the optic tectum (OT) and 2) lack of formation of at least one subtype of neurons
in the OT. Since VPA has been shown to perturb the redox state in other neurons (and has been associated
with a higher incidence of ASD in children with fetal exposure to VPA), this study suggests that redox state
might in fact be important during neuronal development in the OT. Our proposal is designed to follow up on
these initial studies and fill the gap in understanding how OT neurocircuitry and associated behaviors are
regulated by changes in redox state during OT development. In the first aim, we plan to follow in vivo how
the redox state of different cell-compartments in OT neurons changes during normal development and after
the redox state is perturbed by VPA-treatment. In the second aim, we would like to determine when are the
different neuronal cell-subtypes generated in the OT, and if their formation is affected upon redox state
changes by VPA-treatment. Finally, in the third aim, we would like to explore how the changes of redox
state, specifically in the OT, affect behavior. Very few studies have investigated the effects of redox state in
OT circuitry, therefore, our study would fill an important gap in the current understanding. Additionally, since
the SC is associated with ASD, and VPA exposure is also correlated with higher ASD incidence, this study
might shed light into the molecular and cellular underpinnings of ASD."

careers in ASUD and addiction sciences. Importantly, by increasing the diversity of scientists in these fields,
we will provide a platform for developing distinct questions and approaches. Our program has many unique
and innovative aspects: (1) we will expose students to transdisciplinary perspectives in addiction sciences
early in their career, thus promoting substantial interactions with faculty and other trainees from various
disciplines; (2) understanding that the clinical reality of substance abuse often involves co-use and addiction to
multiple substances, many of the mentors in our program will bring experience in poly-substance use; and (3)
we will address structural barriers that will allow greater flexibility for URM students resulting in greater
admission opportunities at USC and nearby universities. In support of this program's diversity-enhancing goals,
the Deans of the School of Pharmacy and Keck School of Medicine will provide application waivers,
guaranteed interviews, and select slots of Ph.D. entry for Rising STARS graduates. This support will advance
USC and Rising STARS goal of enhancing diversity within USC laboratories and Ph.D. programs. Overall, we
are confident that this unique, collaborative program will expand student interest and involvement, enhance
student success, and promote these talented URM students to increase the diversity in the workforce and
improve research strategies by using a transdisciplinary approach of addressing ASUD."
10880149,"ABSTRACT:
Immunotherapy has led to remarkable improvements in patient survival for many tumor types. In particular,
immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown efficacy in many cancer types. These drugs act by turning off pathways
that inactivate T-cells and allow patients’ adaptive immune response to attack tumors,. However, very little is
known about how immunotherapy affects different racial and ethnic populations.
Breast cancer is a disease with substantial disparities in outcomes. Black women have particularly high risk of
mortality from breast cancer and also have higher risk of “triple negative” (estrogen receptor, progesterone
receptor and Her2 negative) breast cancer (TNBC) which is more responsive to immunotherapy. The tumor
immune microenvironment is a strong prognostic factor among women with breast cancer and a strong predictor
of benefit from immunotherapy. In preliminary data, we have found that breast tumors from women of African
ancestry have higher rates of lymphocytic infiltration which is generally associated with better response to
immunotherapy. However, there is no clear data on how well Black women, Hispanic/Latina or Asian women do
on checkpoint inhibitors.
In this application, we will focus on breast cancer disparities and immuno-oncology in the Research Project.
First, we will population based (cancer registry) data to determine how frequently women of different racial, ethnic
and ancestry groups with TNBC are treated with immunotherapy. We will also leverage an existing trial of locally
advanced breast cancer, ISPY2, which includes an immune checkpoint inhibitor. The trial will allow us to examine
genetic ancestry in addition to race and ethnicity. Second, we will examine the tumor immune microenvironment
among women with breast cancer in relation to genetic ancestry and in relation to genetic variants that we have
identified as associated with the tumor immune microenvironment. We will perform deep characterization using
single nuclear RNA-sequencing of a subset of the trial women, comparing responders to non-responders
selected by stratification on race and ethnicity.
We will integrate all of these data and leverage the organizational structure of the accompanying Administrative
Core to interpret these data within the context of what is already known about cancer immunology,
immunotherapy and health disparities. We will build on these results and other projects and datasets to plan
larger projects to address more ambitious questions of how different populations respond to immunotherapy,
how their rates of adverse events compare."

 Delirium is a geriatric syndrome of fluctuating confusion that is a common complication of surgery and
hospitalization in older adults, and is associated with increased risk of death, disability, and dementia. People
with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) are at especially high risk for delirium. The
pathophysiology of delirium is not well understood, but is thought to include neuroinflammation and brain
energetic disruption. These features also link delirium to ADRD. Impaired cerebral glucose metabolism is a
chronic feature of ADRD, and an acute feature of delirium. Similarly, chronic neuroinflammation is thought to
be an important contributor to ADRD, and acute inflammation is associated with delirium. In this translational
project we propose to test an innovative molecular link between acute-on-chronic brain inflammation and
metabolic dysfunction, using cell systems, mouse models, and biospecimens from a human delirium cohort.
 Ketone bodies provide a non-glucose energy source for the brain during fasting, and ketone body
metabolism remains intact in ADRD even with impaired glucose metabolism. We recently found that disrupted
glucose metabolism is an important driver of behavioral changes in mouse models of delirium. We also
recently showed that a ketogenic diet improves memory in both aging mice and an ADRD mouse model. We
developed an innovative toolkit of compounds and genetic models to mechanistically study ketone bodies
experimentally. We hypothesize that energetic support from ketone bodies might help compensate for
inflammation-induced neuronal impairments in glucose metabolism. We also elucidated a new mechanism
linking inflammation to metabolism, showing that activation of peripheral macrophages induces enzymes that
degrade the key metabolic mediator NAD+. Inflammation-driven NAD+ depletion occurs chronically in aging and
ADRD, and may occur acutely in delirium.
 We will use an inflammation model of delirium with normal mice and two ADRD models to test if ketone
bodies or NAD+ can rescue acute delirium-like behavioral changes, and identify the relevant mechanisms (Aim
1). We will use cultured cells and an in vivo brain inflammation model to determine if activated microglia
deplete NAD+ similarly to macrophages, and whether preventing this also rescues delirium-like behaviors (Aim
2). Finally, we will use cerebrospinal fluid samples from a large clinical study of postoperative delirium to
determine how endogenous ketone body and NAD+ levels differ between patients with vs. without delirium
(Aim 3). This collaborative project links basic science expertise in ketone body and NAD+ biology relevant to
ADRD, with basic and clinical research expertise in delirium. It will open a new area of mechanistic study on
inflammation-induced metabolic deficits in delirium, guiding development of translational interventions."

 • Develop, distribute and analyze a needs assessment to determine gaps in knowledge
 • Create new content to support the curriculum standard
 • Vet existing training by mapping to the competencies and integrating into the
curriculum
 • Develop appropriate training opportunities in support of a blended approach to training
 • Develop a training action plan and introduce this in a staged approach
These efforts will create a cadre of regulatory scientists with standardized competence in their
discipline, thereby facilitating long-term improvements to the national food safety system.
Achieving these objectives will require extensive collaboration and coordination among the

module will supply virus preparation assistance and related services for laboratories working with transgenic
animals and/or viral techniques. Second, the Core module will train new investigators and students in basic
molecular biology techniques, including DNA modification to generate new viral vectors, as well as
histological techniques, such as immunostaining. Third, it provides and maintains a range of molecular

adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) have enjoyed increasingly wide application in vision research based on
their many favorable features that include the lack of pathogenicity, low immunogenicity, and the ability to
maintain long-term transgene expression in neurons. The Virus Production & Molecular Biology Core
module will be capable of providing both AAV vector design and production to meet a variety of research
needs among vision researchers at Yale. An in-house capability for virus design and production will
significantly enhance vision research by producing custom, high-titer AAV products not available from

10879744,"ABSTRACT
Animal models are the backbone of many areas of biomedical and preclinical research and the mouse is the
most used model organism in human disease research. Understanding and characterizing mouse models is
considered key to improving the reproducibility of preclinical results in human subjects. To this end it is
important to use preclinical techniques that are analogous to modern clinical techniques to increase the
success of results that translate well to clinical implementation. Unfortunately, the standardization of preclinical
radiation therapy (RT) studies using clinically analogous methodologies has not yet been achieved. In the last
few decades clinical RT technology has developed dramatically, with intensity modulated RT (IMRT)
representing one of the most significant developments. However, these advancements have not translated to
preclinical small animal RT, which largely resembles the state of clinical RT in the 1970s in terms of its use of
simple circular/rectangular beam geometries and uniform beam intensities, and lack of high-quality 3D target
dose conformality. Consequently, small animal RT studies do not simulate the radiobiological,
radioimmunological, hypoxic and toxicity environment of human therapies. To fully standardize preclinical
irradiators to clinically analogous methodologies it is necessary to fully implement IMRT. However, reverse
translation of IMRT from a clinical to preclinical scale (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller) has been challenging
due to technical limitations in engineering appropriately small multi-leaf collimators (MLC).
 Our group has recently developed a 3D printed compensator (3DPC) approach that provides a simple,
reliable, and cost-effective solution in implementing mouse based IMRT. In terms of simplicity and cost-
effectiveness, 3DPC-IMRT requires no additional specialized equipment besides an inexpensive commercially
available 3D printer and printing material. Unlike MLC systems, 3DPC-IMRT has no segments/steps during
delivery leading to shorter treatment times and no mechanical/electrical parts leading to high reliability, lower
maintenance, and reduced QA efforts. Our central hypothesis is that we can develop 3DPC-IMRT into a high-
throughput preclinically useful small animal IMRT system using AI assisted contouring, novel high speed dose
calculation and optimization algorithms, and a mechanism that will allow rapid switching of compensators for
different fields. We propose the following specific aims: (1) Design and development of 3D printed
compensator IMRT (3DPC-IMRT), (2) Development of VMAT like 3DPC-IMRT and AI mouse segmentation
methods, and (3) Dosimetric accuracy evaluation and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) mouse
model study. The success of the proposed project will help radiation biology research better simulate the
clinical RT environment and enable future studies where accurate complex dose distributions are critical."

 Opioids exert their addictive effects by altering signal processing in the reward circuit of the basal ganglia.
This action involves multiple adaptations, including changes in neuronal wiring and synaptic transmission.
Recent evidence suggests that the glutamatergic system plays a critical role in reward. Particularly, group III
metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) have been recognized for their role in shaping opioid effects
Located at presynaptic terminals of neurons, group III mGluRs control the strength of glutamatergic actions
and synaptic plasticity of the reward circuit. The overall goal of this research is to understand molecular
mechanisms by which opioids alter glutamatergic signaling and wiring of the reward circuit.
 The focus of this proposal is on ELFN1, a recently discovered cell-adhesion molecule which interacts
with group III mGluRs, modulates their function and plays a key role in establishing synaptic connectivity.
ELFN1 is selectively expressed in cholinergic interneurons (CIN) in the reward circuit hub – nucleus
accumbens (NAc) and its ablation in mice prominently influences opioid effects. Based on accumulated
preliminary data, we hypothesize that the trans-synaptic interaction of ELFN1 in CIN with group III mGluRs on
glutamatergic afferents in the NAc plays a critical role in the structural and functional plasticity of synaptic
communication in the reward circuit to shape opioid effects.
 This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three complementary Specific Aims that seek to (1) elucidate
the physiological role of ELFN1 in specifying synaptic properties of NAc neurons, (2) determine molecular
mechanisms of ELFN1 action and (3) characterize the contribution of ELFN1-mGluR complexes to rewarding
effects of opioids. The strategy proposed to address these Aims will entail a synergistic combination of
behavioral, genetic, cell-biological, and physiological approaches, exploiting a powerful array of reagents,
animal models, and innovative assays to examine role and mechanisms of ELFN1 in the endogenous setting
of a nervous system. Such studies are expected to provide critical insights into the role of synaptic cell
adhesion molecules in configuring neural circuitry and neuromodulatory receptors involved in reward
processing and opioid use disorder."

Approximately 50% of HGSOCs harbor alterations in the genes involved in homologous recombination (HR)
DNA repair pathway. These tumors tend to respond well to PARP inhibitors and chemotherapy. CCNE1 (Cyclin
E1) gene amplification and overexpression is frequently found in HR-proficient ovarian cancer and is associated
with primary chemoresistance and poor clinical outcomes. CCNE1 gene amplification is present in 15-20%
ovarian tumors, and overexpression of Cyclin E1 is detected in over 40% of ovarian cancer specimens. Currently,
there are no effective treatment approaches for this type of HGSOC. By using Cyclin E1-overexpressing
syngeneic and humanized ovarian patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of HGSOC, we will identify novel
therapies for the treatment of HGSOC cancers with amplification or high expression of Cyclin E1.
Our preliminary data suggests that Cyclin E1 downregulates IRF1 and type I interferon (IFN) expression in a
CDK2 kinase-independent manner in ovarian cancer cells. Our preliminary data also reveal that overexpression
of Cyclin E1 in ovarian cancer cells promotes pro-tumor polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)
in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Expression of IRF1 and type I IFNs has been implicated in pro-tumor
polarization of TAMs in cancers. We plan to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of
Cyclin E1 on the type I IFN signaling pathway and TAMs in Cyclin E1-amplified/overexpressing HGSOC tumors
and to develop therapeutic approaches for this type of ovarian cancer. We hypothesize that downregulation of
IRF1 and type I IFNs by Cyclin E1 in tumor cells fosters an immunosuppressive TME in HGSOC with Cyclin E1-
amplification/overexpression by promoting pro-tumor macrophage polarization. We also hypothesize that
targeting the conventional tumor cell-intrinsic oncogenic function of Cyclin E1 with CDK2i (CDK2 inhibitors) or
ATRi (Ataxia telangiectasia, and Rad3-related inhibitors), in combination with remodeling the pro-tumor TAMs
that induced by expression of Cyclin E1 in the TME with immunomodulators, such as STING agonists, will
provide promising therapeutics for ovarian cancer patients with Cyclin E1-amplification/overexpression. In Aim
1, we will determine how cyclin E1 regulates IRF1 and type I IFNs in both human and mouse ovarian cancer cell
lines. In Aim 2, we will determine how the Cyclin E1-regulated type I IFN signaling pathway promotes pro-tumor
polarization of TAMs and immunosuppression in the TME of HGSOC tumors with Cyclin E1-
amplification/overexpression both in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 3, based on our recent findings that STING agonism
activates type I IFN signaling pathway and repolarizes pro-tumor macrophages to an anti-tumor status, we will
assess the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of STING agonists in combination with CDK2i or ATRi, in both
syngeneic mouse models and humanized PDX models."

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are opportunistic environmental pathogens that are present in soil and
water. NTMpulmonary infections, most commonly due to Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), may result in
chronic, debilitating pulmonary disease (MAC-PD). Treatment, when necessary, consists of 3-4 antibiotics for
14+ months. MAC-PD disproportionately impacts the elderly and women, and those with underlying lung
diseases. The prevalence of MAC-PD is increasing, a trend that will likely continue due to aging populations and
increased comorbidities. Our lack of disease biomarkers poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.
In contrast with its well-studied cousin tuberculosis (TB), with NTM it is difficult to discern colonization vs. disease
caused by these organisms and determine when treatment is necessary or successful. For many patients it is
difficult to obtain sufficient respiratory sputum samples to culture for diagnosis or to monitor for microbiologic
response during therapy. There is a critical need for non-invasive biomarkers to monitor disease activity and
treatment response, in order to limit sputum induction or bronchoscopy procedures and exposure to computed
tomography scan radiation. Furthermore, treatment is frequently initiated to improve the patient's symptoms but
there is scant data on the correlation of measures of patient-reported outcomes with biomarkers of MAC-PD.
The Hu lab has developed an ultra-sensitive CRISPR diagnostic assay using a portable CRISPR-based test to
rapidly detect TB cell-free DNA (cfDNA) directly from blood samples. The test allows early TB diagnosis and
precisely quantifies TB cfDNA for rapid assessment of disease severity or anti-mycobacterial treatment efficacy.
We have preliminary data to suggest this approach can be applied to MAC-PD; accordingly, we seek to evaluate
a cfDNA CRISPR-based diagnostic assay (CRISPR-NTM) to diagnose MAC-PD and measure treatment
response. We will conduct Aims 1 and 2, analytical and clinical validation of the CRISPR-NTM in patients with
MAC-PD during Years 1-2. Aim 2 will use established NTM Biobanks associated with our NTM Clinical Trial
Network (OHSU Coordinating Center) to identify a retrospective cohort of patients with MAC-PD and uninfected
controls with and without chronic underlying lung disease. During Years 1-4, for Aim 3, we will further utilize our
NTM Clinical Trial Network to prospectively collect longitudinal blood samples from patients starting treatment
for MAC-PD (NTM-TREAT) from our 1) ongoing pragmatic clinical trial (MAC2v3) and 2) non-MAC2v3 clinic
patients representing a broader “real-world” patient population. We will also enroll a pilot cohort at treatment
completion (NTM-TRACK), who are subsequently monitored for microbiologic relapse/re-infection. During Years
3-5 we will complete Aim 3 to evaluate the potential for CRISPR-NTM to monitor microbiologic treatment
response and relapse/re-infection. Ultimately, the identification of a biomarker for pulmonary MAC-PD and other
clinically relevant NTM species will optimize diagnosis and monitoring, and facilitate therapeutic decision-making."

 Glaucoma is a disease of the optic nerve causing irreversible blindness and important public health
concern with around 76.9 million glaucoma patients, which is set to increase to 111.8 million in 2040.
Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a form of glaucoma characterized by elevated intraocular
pressure (IOP). A rise in IOP above normal is a major risk for glaucoma with significant consequences
on vision and quality of life. Lowering IOP by 20% significantly decreases the risk of developing
glaucoma in patients with elevated IOP. High IOP in the eye is due to the decreased removal of aqueous
humor through the trabecular meshwork (TM). Changes in the lipid composition of the TM can modify
the actin cytoskeleton interactions can with extracellular structural and biochemical support called the
extracellular matrix (ECM) in the drainage pathway. This process can increase the stiffness of the
drainage pathway tissue attributing to an increase in the IOP. However, the contributions of TM lipids
to stiffness as well as the process of reversing this stiffness have not yet been understood. This is due to
the lack of information on the control of lipid signaling events leading to altered stiffness. In our
serendipitous and novel observation, we have identified that a transcriptional factor called sterol
regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) is activated under constant mechanical stretch and
elevated pressure. Inactivating SREBP lowers the actin tension, ECM deposition, enzymes involved in
lipid biosynthesis, and most significantly lowers IOP. However, this leaves us with many unanswered
questions on how SREBP integrates the biophysical and biochemical entities including TM lipids,
membrane tension, actin cytoskeleton, ECM, and TM stiffness to modulate IOP. Towards this, we aim
to test the hypothesis that – 1. transcriptional control of lipogenesis by SREBP in the TM
outflow pathway is a critical regulator of IOP by A. assessing the correlation between SREBP
activation on IOP changes, B. characterizing the SREBP-dependent temporal changes in lipogenic
genes and enzymes and the ECM distribution in the TM outflow pathway and C. evaluating the role of
IOP in activation of SREBPs, and 2. SREBP activation regulates TM tissue biomechanics by
changing the TM cholesterol and phospholipid contents by A. identifying the contributions of
major lipogenic rate-limiting enzymes like acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) for fatty acid biosynthesis and
HMGCoA reductase (HMGCR) for cholesterol biogenesis on ECM remodeling, B. investigating the real-
time changes in TM membrane tension, actin and microtubule architecture, and C. defining the
cooperative signals between ECM and cellular lipids on the contractile forces generated by the TM
under conditions of tuned SREBP activation. Together, this work will uncover the new biology of lipids
in TM to modulate IOP and identify novel targets to reduce the disease burden of elevated IOP."
10882193,"Extracellular matrix turnover in pathological cardiac remodeling
Heart failure remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Matrix remodeling accompanies systolic and
diastolic dysfunction in the failing heart, and is associated with an alteration of the structure and function of the
cardiac extracellular matrix. Understanding the complex dynamical processes of extracellular matrix re-model-
ing holds the promise for identifying targets and developing therapeutics that may arrest or reverse disease
progression. In failing hearts, changes in extracellular matrix compositions are driven largely by matrix turnover,
which occurs through the continual deposition and degradation of matrix components. Matrix deposition is, in
turn, rate limited by underlying protein synthesis and secretion kinetics. Knowledge into the synthesis and deg-
radation flux of the matrix proteome is therefore essential to understanding the plasticity of matrix adaptation.
In prior work, our team investigated the extracellular matrix proteomes of remodeling mouse hearts to uncover
evidence of hidden fibrotic remodeling in a heart disease model. We have also refined experimental protocols
to measure protein turnover in animal models, and discovered new disease pathways in cardiac hypertrophy
that are not apparent from steady-state protein levels. Spurred by these developments, here we aim to elucidate
the dynamics and plasticity of matrix remodeling, using spatial and temporal proteomics screens that we hy-
pothesize will allow novel targets for anti-fibrotic remodeling strategies to be elucidated. Specifically, we pro-
pose to: (1) measure the individual synthesis and deposition kinetics of matrix proteins in animal models of
heart failure, and examine their changes in relation to matrix composition and function during hypertrophy,
systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and recovery; and (2) dissect regulatory principles of matrix degradation and
examine the respective contributions of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts in normal and fibrotic remodeling con-
texts. Success will reveal insights into the sequence of molecular events that underpin matrix remodeling in
cardiac remodeling and failure. This information may be broadly useful for uncovering new intervention targets
and guiding the development of therapeutic strategies."
10873867,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Most nanoparticles for drug delivery fail in clinical trials due to insufficiency of animal models, highlighting the
need for additional models to support the development of new nanoparticles. Specifically, there are limited
quantitative methods to aid in the systematic design and development of nanoparticles for drug delivery to
cancerous tumors. The proposed computational models can predict drug delivery to tumors, and we
demonstrate model accuracy in preliminary studies. The goal of this project is to develop computational models
that can simulate drug delivery to tumors in 3-D, incorporating spatial heterogeneities in tumor properties. This
is achieved by employing 3-D imaging studies to derive tumor parameter maps, and then integrating those
maps in the computer model. If successful, the proposed computer models will enable systemic evaluation of
nanoparticles not possible with other experimental methods and may result in more efficient nanoparticle-
based cancer therapies."
10873975,"Project Summary
 The objective of the proposed program renewal is to develop capacity of biomedical research trainees
and their commitment to research careers by providing their mentors with linguistically informed and evidence-
based knowledge, skills, and resources for mentoring scientific communication (SciComm). “SCOARE 2.0”
builds on the existing program “Scientific Communication Advances Research Excellence” (NIH-NIGMS,
R25GM125640, 2017-2022), and will expand its reach, augment its curriculum, and ensure its sustainability.
Formal evaluations and preliminary research findings of the original SCOARE program suggest that providing
mentors with the relevant knowledge and skills about SciComm development results in a variety of important
and measurable benefits for their mentees and themselves. The specific aims of SCOARE 2.0 are to 1)
Broaden availability of the existing SCOARE workshops and facilitator training; 2) Adapt the workshop for
future-faculty audiences and add 3 new modules that provide deep dives on giving quality feedback and on
working with mentees of different cultural and linguistic, and ability, backgrounds; 3) Increase impact and
sustainability of the program by translating it to a hybrid asynchronous format. The expected outcomes for this
program include continued delivery of the existing face-to-face program nationally to a minimum of 300
participants (faculty, administrators, and future faculty) as well as train approximately 80 new facilitators;
development and delivery of the new content modules; development and launch of an enduring asynchronous
version of the workshops, freely available online; and external evaluation of all new components. The
innovation of the work is that it is grounded in linguistic and social-cognitive evidence that leverages the
powerful links between language, motivation, and identity and that, to our knowledge, it is the first mentor
training curriculum to address SciComm skill development and its deeper influence on mentee career
intentions. The impact of this program will be to help mentors build a diverse research workforce possessing
superior training and high professional commitment, thus and aligning with the NIH’s goals providing a return
on its investment. The investigators are ideally positioned to carry out this project because of their experience
collaborating on the design, delivery, and evaluation of the existing SCOARE program."
10884313,"SUMMARY
Human fibroatheroma (FA) cap rupture leads to the formation of an occluding thrombus, myocardial infarction
(MI) and sudden death in more than half a million Americans every year. A vulnerable plaque is defined as a
positively remodeled lesion, rich in vasa-vasorum, characterized by smooth muscle cell apoptosis, and
containing a lipid rich pool with a fibrous cap that is infiltrated by macrophages. The current paradigm is that a
cap thickness < 65 µm (thin-cap FA or TCFA) is the key determinant of plaque vulnerability, and rupture occurs
when the cap tissue experiences a peak stress greater than 300 kPa. However, there are several other factors
that play an important role in the FA cap rupture, including atheroma morphology, biological environment, tissue
composition and mechanical forces. Indeed, whether the cap thickness is the single most important criterion
predicting plaque vulnerability is unclear, and the underlying mechanisms for atheroma cap rupture are still
insufficiently understood.
Vascular calcification has emerged among the factors that play an important role in the stability of plaque rupture.
For many decades, cardiovascular calcification has been considered as a passive process, accompanying
atheroma progression, correlated with plaque burden, and apparently without a major role on plaque
vulnerability. Clinical and pathological analyses have previously focused on the total amount of calcification
(calcified area in a whole atheroma cross section), and whether more calcification means higher risk of plaque
rupture or not. However, this paradigm has been changing in the last decade or so. Recent research has focused
on the presence of microcalcifications (µCalcs) in the atheroma, and more importantly on whether clusters of
µCalcs are located in the cap of the atheroma. While the vast majority of µCalcs are found in the lipid pool or
necrotic core, they are inconsequential to vulnerable plaque. We have also demonstrated to date the existence
of thousands of μCalcs primarily in non-ruptured human atheroma caps using µCT imaging, and that they behave
as an intensifier of the background circumferential stress in the cap. However, the similar X-ray absorption
properties of a thrombus and soft tissue complicates the analysis of μCalcs in ruptured FAs. To overcome this
limitation, we have developed a high-resolution contrast-enhanced µCT (CEµCT) approach to investigate
whether μCalcs co-localize with the site of FA cap rupture, in cases where an occluding thrombus is formed,
followed by myocardial infarction. The working hypothesis is that μCalcs in the FA cap has a major effect on the
FA cap rupture threshold. To test this hypothesis we propose to (1) determine the sensitivity and specificity of
μCalcs in the FA cap as a key biomarker of fibroatheroma rupture risk in human coronary vessels, and (2) to
characterize the increase in FA rupture risk due to μCalcs in the ApoE KO mice. If successful, the proposed
study will increase our understanding on vulnerable plaque rupture biomechanics and provide an alternative
paradigm for vulnerable plaque that will consider the effect of μCalcs in human atheroma cap rupture risk."
10881185,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although dysregulated gene transcription is a major contributing factor in cancer, the development of drugs
interfering with general transcription remains a challenging task. The bromodomain-containing protein TAF1 is
the largest component of the multiprotein assembly TFIID, a highly dynamic complex that serves as a general
transcription factor for transcription initiation in eukaryotes. Recently it was reported that TAF1 has a critical role
in AML1-ETO driven acute myeloid leukemia (AML), whereas TAF1 perturbation had little effect on normal
hematopoietic stem cells, implying that TAF1 has the potential to serve as a therapeutic target for AML. Current
approaches to target TAF1 are limited to monovalent small molecule inhibitors of the bromodomain, including
the highly selective and potent Genentech inhibitor GNE-371 and the Astra Zeneca ATR inhibitor AZD6738
(ceralasertib), which we recently reported as a dual TAF1-ATR inhibitor. However, our own data along with
previously reported observations support the notion that such bromodomain inhibitors lack cancer cell kill
potential as judged by cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, p53 and DNA damage signaling studies. As such,
TAF1 is an underexplored potential drug target and no TAF1 inhibitor has reached the clinic. To target TAF1
more efficiently, we applied a structure-guided approach and generated different series of cereblon (CRBN)
directed PROTAC (proteolysis targeting chimera) degraders of TAF1. Early lead PROTACs are highly effective
against AML and other blood cancer cell lines with complete degradation of TAF1 at concentrations as low as 1
nM, and induction of apoptosis. TAF1 depletion and cell survival can be rescued by monovalent inhibitors or
non-degradable TAF1 mutant expression, indicating on-target activity. Low doses of an in vivo active PROTAC
demonstrated significant inhibition of AML tumor xenograft growth and compatibility with long-term survival.
Supported by preliminary data, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that targeted degradation of TAF1 is a
viable strategy to combat AML and other cancers vulnerable to TAF1 depletion. Our objective is to develop first-
in-class TAF1-selective PROTACs and to explore their therapeutic potential. The rationale underlying this
research is that it will provide general insights into the feasibility of TAF1 as a cancer target and build a new
scientific framework whereby new strategies to cancer therapies can be developed. Our approach utilizes
methods in structural biology, medicinal chemistry, and cancer biology, performed by an interdisciplinary team
of researchers and clinician scientists."
10881186,"The aging brain is associated with an increased risk of developing postoperative delirium (POD), postoperative
neurocognitive disorder (PNCD), and Alzheimer’s disease. POD occurs in 9-50% of older patients undergoing
anesthesia and surgery and is associated with a high risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementias (ADRD), greater incidences of postoperative complications, worse clinical outcomes, and higher
mortality. Heightened neuroinflammation is one of the key drivers underlying age-related POD. Existing research
on POD primarily focuses on glial cells and neurons, with little attention paid to the extracellular matrix(ECM).
Cells in the body constantly communicate with other cells and with ECM. It has become increasingly recognized
that ECM provides not only essential physical scaffolding for the cellular constituents but also initiates crucial
biochemical and biomechanical cues that are of utmost functional importance. However, whether ECM is
implicated in POD has yet to be examined. Perineural nets (PNNs) are ECM with chondroitin sulfate
proteoglycan-containing structures surrounding the soma and dendrites of various types of mammalian neurons.
We found that older mice displayed accentuated neuroinflammation characterized by increased Iba-1 expression
as well as decreased PNNs using WFA staining. Microglia depletion using PLX3397 prevented the degradation
of PNNs and deterred the occurrence of POD, suggesting microglia-mediated PNNs degradation as a
neuroinflammation mechanism underlying POD. To directly interrogate neuronal activities in POD, we
established intravital multi-photon microscopy in the hippocampus. Older mice after anesthesia and surgery
demonstrated exaggerated excitatory neuron activities. In contrast, parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, a key
subtype of inhibitory neurons which are often surrounded by PNNs, displayed decreased neuronal activities in
older mice after anesthesia and surgery, revealing excitatory/inhibitory imbalance linked to POD. Based on these
results, we hypothesize that neuroinflammation accompanied by anesthesia and surgery promotes PNNs
degradation which leads to neuronal dysfunction and age-related POD development. We plan to carry out
three interrelated but not interdependent Aims to rigorously test this hypothesis. Aim 1: To investigate the
kinetics of neuroinflammation-mediated PNNs degradation after anesthesia and surgery. Aim 2: To examine if
depleting PNNs surrounding PV interneurons could precipitate POD. Aim 3: To prevent POD by attenuating
neuroinflammation-induced PNNs degradation. Taken together, this proposal uses multidisciplinary tools
including intravital multi-photon imaging, genetic manipulation (microglia depletion, neuron-specific ChABC,
Hapln1 expression, etc.), biochemistry, and animal behavior, to dissect a previously unknown role for PNNs
(ECM) in the pathogenesis of POD, which provides novel mechanistic insights and therapeutic targets for POD,
a condition related to ADRD."
